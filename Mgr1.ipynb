       "    'review': 'The game follows a young boy who must navigate through a dark and dystopian world filled with danger and mystery. The gameplay consists of solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles by manipulating the environment and interacting with various objects and creatures.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of \"Inside\" is its stunning visual design. The game\\'s art style is simplistic yet incredibly effective, using a dark and moody color palette to create a sense of unease and tension. The attention to detail in the environment is also impressive, with every area of the game feeling meticulously crafted and full of hidden secrets.\\n\\nThe game\\'s sound design is equally impressive, with an eerie and unsettling soundtrack that perfectly complements the game\\'s visuals and atmosphere. The game also uses sound cues to great effect, helping to guide the player through puzzles and alerting them to potential danger.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most impressive aspect of \"Inside\" is its storytelling. The game tells a captivating and mysterious story without ever relying on exposition or dialogue. Instead, the story is told through the environment and the player\\'s interactions with it, leaving much of the interpretation up to the player.\\n\\nOverall, \"Inside\" is an outstanding game that successfully combines innovative gameplay, striking visuals, and a captivating story to create an experience that is both thrilling and thought-provoking. It\\'s a must-play for anyone who enjoys puzzle-platformers or is looking for a game that pushes the boundaries of what video games can achieve as a storytelling medium.',\n",

       "    'review': \"Inside is a fantastic audiovisual experience that well outdoes the development team's previous effort. It is full of tense moments and often plays like a horror title. I can't fault the presentation in any major way. \\n\\nMechanically, the game is full of relatively simplistic puzzles. Unlike what one might expect, these puzzles don't gradually teach the player things or culminate in a final challenge that calls on the player to demonstrate what they've learned. There's little to say about the game mechanically.\\n\\nThere's also--and this is the more unfortunate and serious criticism--little to nothing to say about the game thematically. Inside clearly wants to say or suggest something about despotic governments, oppression, the devaluation of life by huge systems and so on, but never actually does. One doesn't even get the catharsis of 'revenge' on their pursuers if that's what one was looking toward. \\n\\nIt's like if you were to watch a wordless Twilight Zone episode which ultimately had no point at all, nothing to say (something anathema to Rod Sterling). There is a twist, and you can try to intuit what that twist means, but beyond plot curiosities, there is nothing there. You move from inside a system of oppression to, at least in a literal sense, outside of a containment building. \\n\\nI have to consider this a major criticism because with all this beautiful art and evocative imagery and sound, there is so much opportunity left on the table to actually take the time to try and *say* or even simply *show* anything at all about its subject matter. It's another in a long trend of indie works that thinks that ambiguity is a stand-in for actual courage and intellect in one's art, for the willingness to take a stand on something. \\n\\nAnd, while ambiguity and mystery can be a powerful force in a work, those works still need to have said something along the way before you leave viewers to ponder, not unlike David Lynch's works. Inside makes no such effort. It never works up to anything, either a big, grand puzzle or a punctuating emotional moment. It settles for the kind of low-effort 'storytelling' that people mistake for depth.\\n\\nSo while I can recommend it as a walking simulator with light puzzle/horror elements and an intriguing world (which admittedly cribs a lot from Valve's work on Half-Life 2), I can't recommend it as a thematic experience, story, or really anything that might create a lasting impression on someone beyond its largely neutral imagery.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Lot to say about this game.\\n\\nI think the first thing I have to note though is the brutality. Because while the game is gorgeous, the world building is spectacular (with no dialogue! Show, don\\'t tell), the puzzles are clever, and the escape sequences are so tightly timed that I tensed up [i]every single time[/i], I HAVE to warn you that it\\'s unapologetic in its gruesome story telling.\\n\\nINSIDE is not a happy story. It\\'s depressing, dark, and twisted, but most importantly: It\\'s terrifically done. INSIDE had my skin crawling like few games dared to try. But that meant going through with the graphic content to back up the stakes.\\n\\nI\\'m going to list a one of the death animations and describe it, but under a spoiler tag. That way if you need the extra info to decide, it\\'s there, but I\\'m not spoiling anything for somebody just scrolling by. But to note: Some of these wouldn\\'t be as bad if you weren\\'t a [i]child[/i] being killed.\\n\\n[spoiler] When a dog catches you, there\\'s a full death sequence. It bites you, some tear at you, others snap your neck. And you watch for a couple seconds after you die, so it\\'s just dogs eating your body, or your now limp body hanging from the dog\\'s mouth. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler] If adults catch you, you get a couple different ones as well. Strangulation seemed to be the most popular, but I was also beaten with a stick/bat once. Again, disturbing to see an adult beat a child like that. [/spoiler]\\n\\nALL THAT SAID:\\n\\nIt\\'s [i]incredibly[/i] well made. The world-crafting is terrifically done, as they make every scene you go through count. Watching the people march along, realizing what this factory does to people here, all through phenomenal visual storytelling.\\n\\nAnd the puzzles fit the world perfectly. INSIDE does what LIMBO did, where you create a gorgeous puzzle game with no UI, except INSIDE did it cleaner. I loved LIMBO, but some of it was tough with it being all black. Through INSIDE, they\\'re able to take full control of color design to make the entire puzzle even better. It\\'s easier to tell what you can interact with and what you can\\'t, the context clues are more fleshed out, and the whole experience flows better for it. Mess up a puzzle and you\\'ll be able to catch what went wrong from your first death. It\\'s great that I only have to mess up once, and the death again gives you clues on what went wrong. I stood somewhere too long, I should\\'ve let go sooner, whatever it is.\\n\\nThe flow of the whole game feels terrific. I didn\\'t realize how jarring it was to go from a desert to the sewers to ice capped mountains, when suddenly I ran into a puzzle game that flowed the whole way through. There were varied environments to work through, giving you a diverse array of puzzles, but it wasn\\'t just abruptly changing scenery all the time. INSIDE\\'s visual design is on a whole separate level in this regard. The enemies that appear, how you dealt with them, and how that progressed the game were [i]beyond[/i] brilliant as well. I\\'m going to talk about a part from the trailer, so no spoiler tag here: The part where you have to lock-step with other people was AMAZING mid-game. It happens, you have to go through with it, and eventually you make your way out the other side. But I wasn\\'t ready for it, and it felt like such a fun part of the puzzle to do and experience. It\\'s nerve racking, despite being one of the simplest parts of the game!\\n\\nEvery facet of this game is finely tuned and crafted to make the most of a video game that you can. The dogs barking, the chain link fence jostling, the silence, the loud bangs, all entirely uninterrupted by flimsy stories to justify you changing from the sewers to Paris france even though you were on a mountain. No UI prompts, no minimaps, no score, no timer, no health bar, to bring you that much closer to the piece of art and not the \"video game\" portion of the format.\\n\\nSincerely recommend, it sets a ridiculous bar for video game story telling as a format. Other games would do well to learn from INSIDE. Not copy it, but learn from it.',\n",

The end can be disturbing if you don't like body horror. It's more cartoonish, so I personally managed.\\nStill, there's a lot of being chased involved in this game, which I don't like, by humans, dogs and creatures I won't spoil. There's much more chasing than in Limbo, which focused on puzzles. Limbo's spiders were cute in comparison.\\n\\nI also thought the puzzles in Limbo were more elaborate and not as easy. But maybe my memory tricks me. There were some good puzzles here, too, but a lot were easy to grasp for me. With the graphic the game is definitely atmospheric though and I still enjoyed playing it. It's more like dark art than a game, similar to Limbo the game gets you thinking...\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Oh boy, where do I even begin with my review of \"Inside\"? This game is an absolute masterpiece.First of all, the visuals in this game are stunning. The art style is minimalist but incredibly effective at setting the mood and creating a sense of unease. The animations are so smooth that it\\'s almost like watching a Pixar movie (except with a lot more darkness and existential dread).But the real star of the show here is the gameplay. \"Inside\" is a puzzle platformer that will have you scratching your head and wracking your brain, but in the most enjoyable way possible. Every level is a unique challenge, and you\\'ll find yourself constantly surprised by the clever ways the game forces you to think outside the box.And let\\'s not forget about the story. I won\\'t give anything away, but let\\'s just say that \"Inside\" is one of those rare games that manages to be both incredibly thought-provoking and absolutely bonkers at the same time. It\\'s the kind of game that will stick with you long after you\\'ve finished it, and leave you pondering its meaning for days.Overall, I can\\'t recommend \"Inside\" enough. It\\'s a funny, heartwarming romp through a world of darkness and despair that will leave you feeling optimistic about the human condition. Okay, maybe not that last part, but seriously, go play this game. You won\\'t regret it!',\n",

       "    'review': \"INSIDE is an absolutely breathtaking game that left me awestruck with its incredible graphics, immersive atmosphere, and hauntingly beautiful music. As someone who loved LIMBO, I found that INSIDE takes the concept to a whole new level. While the puzzles weren't the most challenging, they were still enjoyable and kept me engaged throughout the game.\\n\\nDespite its brevity, INSIDE manages to pack an emotional punch with its incredible storytelling and unforgettable visuals. The platforming is tight, and the overall experience is simply unforgettable. I found myself getting lost in the game's incredible world and didn't want the journey to end.\\n\\nIn conclusion, INSIDE is a must-play for anyone who appreciates a game with incredible atmosphere, stunning visuals, and an engaging story. While the puzzles may not be the most challenging, the game more than makes up for it with its other strengths. If you're looking for a game that will leave you with a sense of wonder and amazement, then INSIDE is definitely worth checking out!\\n\\nWritten using ChatGPT cause I was too lazy lol. But seriously, sick game 10/10 👍👍\",\n",

       "    'review': \"Wow!\\n\\nI liked Limbo a lot, but this in many ways, is very much an improvement on the original. Almost 7 years after its release and this is still a really nice looking game. It also controls incredibly smoothly. The sound and atmosphere created by this game is basically unparalleled. At least, in my experience. If more horror games were like this, rather than resorting to jump scares, I would like the genre so much more.\\n\\nIt's hard to really discuss much about this one without spoiling anything. In fact, my favourite part of this game is a complete spoiler. Though, anyone that's played it will know what I'm talking about. I think the only way that this could be considered inferior to Limbo is the fact that the puzzles were overall easier. In my experience anyway, as I never looked up any solutions for Inside. Though, I liked that there was less trial and error deaths during Inside. I'm not sure how much harder or easier the hidden collectibles could be, because that's never my focus when playing a game.\\n\\nI urge anyone that can stand a little creep factor and is not completely averse to puzzles to give this one a try. Wait for a sale if you must, but this 4-hour experience was worth the full price of admission.\",\n",

Местами игра классная, но в целом скучная, \\n1. мало интерактива- большую часть времени ты просто двигаешь кубики или бегаешь от кого-то. \\n2. пазлы максимально скучные в 99.9% случаях. \\n3. Музыкальное сопровождение лишь местами прикольное, в 80% ничего впечатляющего\\n4. Потенциал игры огромный, но сделали по итогу посредственный продукт\\nУдивлён, что такие высокие отзывы об игре(скорее всего из-за того, что она максимально простая- играется через две кнопки+передвижение\\nНа чиле побегать можно зайти от скуки или на работе',\n",

       "    'review': 'I recently picked up \"Inside\" on a spring sale for just 1.10 USD (83 INR), and I have to say, it was an absolute steal. The puzzles were challenging yet satisfying to solve, and the atmosphere was absolutely haunting. I completed the game and unlocked all of the achievements in just three hours, but the experience was so engrossing that I was left wanting more.\\n\\nWhat sets \"Inside\" apart from other puzzle games is its thought-provoking storytelling and stunning visuals. The developers have truly created a world that is both beautiful and disturbing, and the soundtrack only adds to the overall immersive experience.\\n\\nI was also impressed with the incredible value for money that I got with this game - thanks to the spring sale, I was able to purchase the \"Inside and Limbo\" combo pack for such a low price. I can\\'t wait to dive into \"Limbo\" and see what other incredible worlds the developers have created.\\n\\nI want to take a moment to appreciate the developers of \"Inside\" for their hard work and dedication in creating such a memorable and unique gaming experience. They have clearly poured their hearts into this game, and it shows in every aspect of it. If you\\'re looking for a game that will stick with you long after you\\'ve finished playing, I highly recommend \"Inside\".',\n",

       "    'review': '[h1]An amazing game that builds on what made [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url] great[/h1]\\n\\n[u]Summary at the end - for the easily persuaded[/u]\\n\\n[b]Overall Impression:[/b]\\n[i]INSIDE[/i] is another great game from [url=http://playdead.com/]Playdead[/url]. While it has no direct connection to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url] except that it comes from the same studio, you immediately get the sense that this game is based on [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url]. The fluidity of your character´s movement, the subte yet beautiful background and the sounds that match the action perfectly - all these staples of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url] are artistically reinvigorated in [i]INSIDE[/i]. \\n\\nWithout spoiling anything, [i]INSIDE[/i] has a creepy atmosphere that is complemented by simplistic, yet stunning visuals and sounds that give an eerie feeling. Storywise, it leaves almost everything up to interpretation, which I percieve to be a good thing because it doesn´t spoon feed you. There is no notable dialogue. No tutorial. No help. You´re thrown into the game without even so much as a main menu. And that´s great because it´s unique.\\n\\nHowever, this game does have some cons, as any indie game does (otherwise it would be mainstream). It is fairly short - at a relaxed pace, I played it through in four hours. For the price of €11.99 (-40% on sale), thats more money per hour than most other games. Especially when we consider that there is a lack of replayability in this game - once you´ve played it you know the solutions to the puzzles and can (maybe) come back to it a few months, if not years, later. But if, like me, you don´t measure games by cost per hour but rather by entertainment value, you´ll be impressed. That said, I do recommend getting [i]INSIDE[/i] on sale rather than full price, or waiting for the price to drop over time, because €20 is pretty steep.\\n\\nAnother negative is the ending. [u]MINOR SPOILER AHEAD[/u] [spoiler]In my opinion, the ending is pretty unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unanswered.[/spoiler] It leaves much up to imagination, which could be considered a good thing as I said before, but in the case of the ending it lacks clarity.\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Simplistic yet stunning visuals\\n[*]Fiiting, creepy sounds\\n[*]Atmosphere of uncertainty that inspires player´s imagination\\n[*]Appeals wonderfully to [I]LIMBO[/i] fans\\n[*]You aren´t spoon-fed\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n[*]High price per hour (if purchased at €20 and not on sale)\\n[*]Lack of replayability\\n[*]Ending - see minor spoiler above\\n\\n[b]Summary[/b]\\n[i]INSIDE[/i] is an indie game with beauty and is artistically executed. While it lacks replay incentification or price value (at the current €20), it doesn´t spoon-feed you and instead inspires your imagination. If you liked [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url], you´ll love this. \\nFinal verdict: [b]8.5/10[/b] - Buy on sale or after price drops',\n",

It's not just about puzzles and getting yourself to the next step, if you pay attention to whatever happens around you; the sounds, voices, movements, light affects and the ideas, you will actually know that INSIDE has a very deep meanings.\\n\\n* I enjoyed INSIDE although it's a short game that took me nearly 5 hours to 100% finish the game along with its achivements, taking into concediration that I normally had to repeat some parts where I died few times before solving the puzzle and moving on.\\n\\n* For me I got INSIDE on the Summer Sale 2017, and I recommend buying the game on sale.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: The coming parts, along with my screenshots includes spoilers !!\\n\\n[spoiler] SPOILER ALLERT\\t[/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler] After completing the game, you might start wondering about what does all of this mess means. Well it differs from one player to another but for me I think that INSIDE is all about mind manipulating and enslaving poor and weak people. That can go as a general idea, but for the idea that is a little bit more obvious, the main character of INSIDE is this little boy who came from the poor or similarly, the low class of people. somehow this little boy managed to escape and not being captured by the scouters who appears at the beginning of the game. these scouters work for a huge orgnization that targets the low class people of the society as they are considered as worthless creatures regardless their role in the society, capturing them and using them as lab rats under the supervision of the company's or orgnization's scientists. Performing new tests and experiments directly on these enslaved people which will lead into so many mutations and transformations. One experiment after another (The Company) have reached to a point in where they can control the minds of the enslaved ones which will result in controlling their actions. This is the new trade that gains the capitalists huge profits by offering this mind control to the high class people of the world so they can use the enslaved mind controlled people as machines at their service. \\t[/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler] Back to the little boy, as I mentioned he managed to escape from being captured by the scouters, and then he tries to find his way out of all of this. But, on the way his concepts changed as he experienced the role of the mind controller. Now, he aims to free out all of the other people who have been captured and been put and used in the experiements of The Company. During this journey some concepts can be noticed as they describe the little boy's thoughts changing such as: the little tiny chicks at the beginning of the game, if you pay attention, after blowing them towards the box none of them dies yet one of them starts to walk slower than others and apperantly seems weaker. The mind whipped bodies that the little boy controls using the mind controling helmet are another example; in the part of the game where you need to gather 19 of them to open the huge metal door, you can realize that the last one of them is a dead body. And the other group of the mind whipped or controlled people who provides help in the elevator, you can actually realize that this group includes individuals that lost an arm, a leg or even a head. All of these details are pointing to one direction: the change of heart and mind of the little boy. [/spoiler]\\n\\n[spoiler] How? the little boy now knows that working in a group and for the benefit of the majority, a sacrifice is a must. The little chick, the dead one and the lost organs ! as he reaches the big dome that he knows later on that it is actually a big tank, he manages to dive in and be close to a big, sticky, organic blob that is made of organs and people, body parts, legs, arms and even heads ! all in one big strange manipulated formation ! these are the people of his class in this society, could be his friends, or even family ! so he now believes that he must sacrifice him self for the benefit of the majority as he tries to unplug the mind controlling healmets he gets sucked into the blob and then try to lead it to its freedom and its way out of this place. The blob causes chaeos and huge losses inside The Company while on its way out and finally rests on a shore with some sun light away from The Company... The little boy managed to save the currently captured people, but who knows what rich and powerful people can do again !\\t[/spoiler]\\n\\nAt the end thats my opinion, and as I said other people may have different thoughts about all of this.\\n\\nThe game is amazing and worth buying it.\\n\\n* 11/25/2017,  nominated for The “Defies Description” Award.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"[b]Well, its obvious where the [i]Limbo[/i] developer's have been putting in their time.[/b] [i]INSIDE[/i] is brimming with atmosphere, feelings, and attention to detail. I mean it doesn't take more than 10 minute to see how meticulously hand-crafted and polished this title is. The only question in my mind, really, is if its worth the debatably steep asking price. For me? Oh sure, you bet. You aren't going to get 20 hours (likely closer to 3-5), but damn, you will get an experience. While I enjoyed [i]Limbo[/i], I thought [i]INSIDE[/i] was overall much better.\\n\\n[i]Essentially, this is a walking/experience simulator with medium-level puzzles.[/i] And I don't mean 'walking simulator' in a derogatory way - its great fun. I should note that this game is rather dark, triggering some moderate level anxiety at moments. Definately scary at times, too.\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n+Definately some of the most attention-to-details I've seen in a game. What points it loses for overall length, it definately gains in being one of the highest of quality experiences.\\n+Sounds and music are outstanding.\\n+The [i]feelings[/i] are real, with this one. You will definatley go through a range of emotions.\\n+'Storyline' is quite original, albeit abstract. Don't expect to walk away understanding everything.\\n+Thankfully, the puzzles aren't super difficult. This is more focused on the experience, which I appreciated.\\n+The scope of the rooms and areas were just magnificient. \\n+Controller support is great.\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n-Definately expensive, although they arguably earned their money. The devil is in the details. Those animations are obviously all custom.\\n-Some moments verged on being too anxiety ridden/scary for me. Thankfully I pushed through and it worked out well, though.\\n-While there was a range of environments, I would have liked to see less 'Portal factory' and more perhaps outside. Its fine, and I'm being slightly picky, but there it is.\\n\\n[b]For any indie game enthusiast, this is a must have.[/b] Now with that being said, I'm sure if you wait, it will be on a half-price sale sooner than later. Either way, make sure you play through this game some time in 2016.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"INSIDE is a game primarily concerned with the human body and it's limitations within physics. That it achieves this preoccupation that might at first seem overly ambitious for a 2D(ish) platformer stands as a testament to the talent of Playdead and the clarity of their vision. \\n\\nI played and loved LIMBO, and went into INSIDE expecting LIMBO 2.0, with updated graphics and a higher budget. At its most basic level it is that, at least for the opening stretch. You're a small boy. The world is hostile to you if it notices your presence. You must move roughly right to reach an undefined goal, solving puzzles to get past each layer. However, INSIDE differs from this formula in a number of key ways. It does away with the gravity element of LIMBO that many people disliked, and switches it for a more visually stunning mechanic involving water, that also feels more thematically relevant. The water itself is also a large addition, and a knowing joke on the developers part-everyone's least favourite part of 2D platformers is universally the water levels, and yet Playdead built water levels into their game in a way that feels vital, beautiful, and kind of terrifying.\\n\\nSo how does INSIDE open up this conversation on the body? The protagonist being a small boy, his body's limitations are immediately apparent. They are stressed through the way that he must use the environment for his help, in various ways, but most significantly the controlling of other bodies, which gives him strength and numbers, making the puzzles easily possible. But even when the player feels the power of this control, the soundtrack of pitiful noises the bodies make turns it into something extremely uncomfortable. As you navigate through what appears to be some kind of facility, it becomes clear that this place is built around the research of this kind of control. What is not clear is, where do these bodies come from. Are they grown? Were they once people? \\n\\nThe games final stretch clarifies this theme, although I won't go into it here. I've heard some people express dislike of the ending, but I thought it was fantastic, in the most unsettling and upsetting way. Where LIMBO went straight for your emotions, INSIDE is content to go for your brain and play with it.\\n\\nAnyway. Please play this game if you haven't yet.\",\n",

Although I myself prefer 3D open world-ish games, I didn\\'t feel at all restricted in this \"2.5D\" game. It was done so well that you barely even realize you\\'re in a 2D game. Game mechanics are also very simple yet effective.\\n\\nHowever, because this game is so good and the story is so powerful, it\\'s the kind of game that you can only really play once. Maybe twice to get all the achievements (and to see the alternate ending which by the way is just as dark and unexpected as the regular ending), but any more than that and the game just doesn\\'t have the same effect because you already know what\\'s to come.\\n\\nIt\\'s well worth the money though, even just to play it once.

That's not always the goal of a horror game.\\nMy bad dreams often are filled with the feeling of being somewhere that I shouldn't be. The feeling of being chased. The feeling of helplessness.

       "    'review': '[h1] Beautifully Bleak\\t[/h1]\\n\\n[b] A Step up from LIMBO\\t[/b]\\n\\nINSIDE is a puzzle platformer brought to us by Playdead, the same team who made LIMBO. It’s very easy to notice the similarities between the two games, and if you’re a fan of LIMBO I believe it’s safe to say you’ll love INSIDE. That being said, INSIDE brings forth many new elements which makes it stand on its own as a unique experience and in my opinion, a masterpiece. \\n\\n[b] Gameplay\\t[/b]\\n\\nLike its predecessor, in INSIDE you play as a young boy as he navigates his way through a dark and mysterious world. The gameplay itself is a lot of fun, with puzzles that are extremely interesting and varied enough to not ever feel repetitive. Most of the puzzles present themselves fairly clearly, something which I found allowed me to spend less time thinking about what I had to do and more on the feeling of suspense and the actual story. This works well with the game since there is high level of tension throughout much of it, with many parts specifically designed to make it so you just barely escape the clutches of death. This makes for some moments that are very heart pounding and almost theatrical. \\n\\n[b] Stunning Setting\\t[/b]\\n\\nThe atmosphere is impeccable. Everything about the way in which the game sounds and looks adds to the overall mood. The sounds and music are minimalistic, making it eerily quiet at times with just the perfect effects or music to amplify the moment. The art style is absolutely stunning and manages to add beauty to the otherwise very bleak and ominous setting of the game. Beyond that, INSIDE has some of the best animations that I’ve ever seen in a platformer. There seems to be an animation for every slight movement you could possibly make. This adds an incredible amount of character to the young boy, making him seem so much more real and causing you feel even more personally invested with his well being.\\n\\n[b] Story\\t[/b]\\n\\nLike LIMBO, INSIDE manages to say so much without saying anything at all. It’s very story rich, but instead of holding your hand and explaining everything it leaves you to put together the pieces as you make your way through the game. The story is fantastic and wonderfully twisted, keeping you wanting to continue onwards to see what happens next. The payoff to this is enormous, as the storyline is perfectly built up to an ending that I found to be very well done. I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about the story, and I think this is the best way to go. The manner in which everything unfolds is captivating and best experienced with a clean slate. \\n\\nMy one and only complaint about this game is that it’s a bit short, taking me just a few hours to complete as well as go back and earn the achievements I had missed. However, I think this stems from my love of this game and simply being sad to see it end. Setting aside my desire to squeeze even more out of this experience, it really is a perfectly paced game, giving us enough time to fully enjoy it without going on too long and becoming stale. \\n\\n[b] My Verdict\\t[/b]\\n\\nThe asking price might be a bit too high for some, but I can honestly say that this is not only the game of the year for me but is now one of my favorite indie titles ever, so it was well worth it to me and I’m happy to support games of this caliber. However I realize not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did or want to spend that amount, so if you’re unsure there’s never any harm in waiting until the price has dropped or you can grab it on sale.',\n",

When?\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played Limbo, you\\'ll know generally what to expect here in terms of gameplay. Running, jumping, and suffering a brutal death when you miscalculate anything. It\\'s smooth, beautifully animated, and controls well with a gamepad. While some sections are challenging, it\\'s more about figuring out how not to get killed than a sheer test of platforming skill. \\n\\nBut there\\'s so much more to it than that. Every minute of the game will lead you in unexpected directions. It virtually never uses the same idea twice without significant alteration. Some mechanics are even introduced once, then discarded for the rest of the game. And it\\'s loaded with interesting ideas, keeping me excited to explore each new creepy area. \\n\\nAnd it IS quite creepy. Not in a jumpscare horror sense. But with the unexplained hostility of enemies, and the gloomy, deteriorated backgrounds, there\\'s a sense of something being very wrong with this world. It uses silence and emptiness to incredible effect. The word \"oppressive\" comes to mind. \\n\\nAlso like Limbo, the plot advances without any dialogue, exposition, or really any indication of what\\'s really going on at all. It\\'s loaded with clues and implications all throughout, but never outright tells you anything. You\\'re left to wonder, right up until an ending I couldn\\'t possibly have predicted. It left me blinking, to say the least. \\n\\nIt\\'s not all that long. Just a few hours. But where a longer game would have recycled its many ideas to pad out length, Inside doesn\\'t waste your time. You\\'ll find yourself mentally lost in its world, unable to put it down without seeing what could possibly be next. A journey well worth taking.',\n",

       "    'review': \"Like its predecessor Limbo, Inside is a simple to control puzzle platformer where you guide an extremely athletic but rather fragile young boy through a perilous world towards an unknown goal, with every success likely interspersed with frequent, and sometimes horrific, deaths. But as enjoyable as Limbo was to play, Inside is simply better.\\n\\nThe setting is more interesting - dystopian factories, control rooms, laboratories in the midst of conducting bizarre experiments, ruined buildings, flooded underwater sections, and a handful of outdoor areas, all filled with weird, creepy, and occasionally stunning visuals, creatures, characters, and events. The puzzles hit that sweet spot of requiring contemplation and experimentation, but not requiring a walkthough, and it's thoroughly satisfying to walk into a new area, initially without a clue as to how to proceed, but then with a lever pull here, or a crate move there, have things slowly fall into place (sometimes literally) until suddenly it all makes sense and you can move on. There's a few timing-based puzzles that can get a bit frustrating, but they're nothing more than a minor negative, and are more than balanced out by some truly creative ones. Like Limbo, Inside's world is primarily black and white, but the graphical style is superior, with many areas featuring an incredible visual depth, and detailed, well-populated backgrounds. Your young avatar might be limited to moving in a 2D plane, but Inside's inhabitants are not, and sometimes a character off in the distance who initially seems like nothing more than interesting window dressing will unexpectedly rush forward to pose a significant threat. And the various character animations are excellent, particularly towards the end of the game.\\n\\nAnd what an ending it is. Inside starts out good, gets REALLY good, and then the last half an hour is simply some of the most enjoyable, memorable gameplay I can recollect. It's all backed by a great story too, but one that's told without a single line of dialogue or written text - everything is left to your interpretation. It's the kind of game you'll find yourself thinking about after finishing, or hunting down fan theories to try to determine what the heck you just experienced. There's a brief alternate ending that can be unlocked as well, and while it's not especially impressive by itself, it certainly will supply some serious fodder to the theorists.\\n\\nI expected Inside to be a solid puzzle platformer, but it's more than that, and has become one of my favorite games of 2016. If you liked Limbo, if you're a fan of the genre, or simply want to play a good, interesting, different kind of game, I highly recommend it. The only caveat is that for a game that will likely take you about six hours to complete, the current $20 dollar price tag might be off-putting. But I for one found it well worth it.\",\n",

       "    'review': '[b]Disturbed. Speechless. Wholeheartedly in awe.[/b]\\nThat\\'s how I\\'m feeling after full playtrough.\\n\\nIt was few years back, when I began depressing journey with [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/]Limbo[/url][/i]. Back then it was for me much more discouraging because of the puzzles, that my brain just couldn\\'t handle; but I was in Love with the tone, visualisation, and playing it - until I reached the end - and to this day, [i]Limbo[/i] is game that I will, with pleasure, recommend till the end of time.\\n\\nAfter five long years [i][url=http://playdead.com/]Playdead[/url][/i] came up with their second tittle - [i]INSIDE[/i].\\nLet me tell you right away - waiting this long was worth it!\\n\\n[i]INSIDE[/i] is showcase what someones devotion to games, great artistic vision, trust in player base and brilliant mind can come up with, in this crowded gaming world.\\nFrom start it wasn\\'t for me possible to look at this game, and be bored, or be disinterested; because with every frame comes new thing to discover.\\n\\nI was trying to keep away from spoilers, as much as I could. I succeeded. \\n[i]You playing as little kid; running from people, beasts; timing your jumps so you wouldn\\'t end as splatter in dark alley, and being careful while swimming in the dark; trying to grasp control over you life, and life of others. You run forward where mystery of this world is hiding, and along the way figure out your purpose in this dark and twisted story.[/i]\\nWhat is happening here is disturbing, weird, confusing, and if the ending won\\'t leave you with sense of \"What the F*, just happened!\", I seriously don\\'t know what will. \\nThis story works perfectly, and when credits starts to roll, that is the point where your interest will spike even higher, cause you want to know more ... also there is alternative ending, which digs even deeper.\\n\\nStory (despite how much I enjoyed it) is sidetracked by astonishing visuals and overall aesthetics. \\n[i]INSIDE[/i] looks spectacular. \\nForeground and background seamlessly coming together at the center where the action lies. Work with lighting and shadow in just incredible, and the level of detail that is made because of this, is just top level. \\nEverything on screen is set as indented, just to give us this eerie feeling, sense of hopelessness and misfortune behind every corner.\\nWhen you add to this mix great ambience sound, with on point sound design - result should leave you entirely at awe.\\n\\nControls are smooth, and on point. I didn\\'t experience any issues whatsoever while playing with controller.\\n\\nMy biggest fear were puzzles. After [i]Limbo[/i], I was really cautious. Why? Let\\'s just say, there were moments I rage quit a lot. Not with [i]INSIDE[/i]. Yes, I admit, there were few instances of me getting annoyed and discouraged, but if it was up to five times I\\'m already exaggerating. So on this front, I was satisfied with myself that I could get thru, with only smallest possible help of guides (just a couple - I swear to God, I don\\'t believe in). Also it was so satisfying for me, to pat my own back for job well done, when I figured something out (yes, I\\'m one of those people - dumb). \\n\\nI won\\'t shy away from statement, that [i]INSIDE[/i] could easily be pinnacle of gaming in my personal experience. \\nThis is art that should be celebrated by playing it, and afterwards recommended it to others, so they can too experience this game. I agree; story might not suit everyone (ending is probably even worse in this manner), but from technical stand point and playability this comes to very top. \\n\\n[b]Thank you[/b] [i]Playdead[/i] for this game, \\nand whoever you are reading this, and still didn\\'t play [i]INSIDE[/i] just do it!\\n\\n[i]Grade:[/i][b] A+[/b]',\n",

       "    'review': 'INSIDE is a sidescrolling platformer made by Playdead, who also made Limbo. The game will feel very familiar if you have played Limbo back in the day. The gameplay mechanics and even to some degree, the atmosphere feels similar. The game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful. \\n\\n[u][b][h1]Graphics:[/h1][/b][/u]\\n\\nThe game features one of the best looking visuals I have seen on a sidescoller game. The graphics are somewhat simplistic, the characters don’t even have face features, they all just have a blank face and that’s probably the art-style chosen deliberately by the developers to convey their vision of the game. To add that mood and atmosphere to the game. The game always ran on 60 FPS for me, not a drop at any time. The FPS are locked at 60 FPS.\\n\\n[u][b][h1]Sound:[/h1][/b][/u]\\n\\nLike the graphics, the sounds are minimal too but as an aritisic choice. The ambient music, the minimalistic sounds really add to the already creepy atmosphere of the game. In the intense moments of games such as enemies chasing you and closing in on you, heartbeat sounds can be heard which really add to the whole creepy experience of the game.\\n\\n[u][b][h1]Gameplay:[/h1][/b][/u]\\n\\nSimilar to Limbo, you just start off in the game and nothing is explained. The story is left up to the users to interpret. INSIDE starts off with you, a boy, dropped off in a forest. You start going forward, only to find out that you’re being hunted and the people in the background are looking for you and upon sighting, you they will chase you down and kill you. They have dogs as well who will relentlessly chew you down when they catch you. These enemies are usually in the background but they can spot you and run towards you to the foreground.\\n\\nSimilar to Limbo, you have almost exactly the same running patter, you can jump very similarly and can drag objects, open doors and grab onto ledges to pull yourself up etc. That’s the basic movement in this game. There are new puzzle types introduced in this game like the mind controlling of the almost zombie like humans. The puzzles themselves are not hard at all and at most take 2-3 attempts before you figure them out. There are a few longer puzzles too, one for example require you wandering in at least 4 places looking for more zombie mind controllable humans.\\n\\nThe game’s setting can be really atmospheric. Some segments which are underwater or segments with dogs chasing after you in a short space can make you feel downright claustrophobic. To avoid any spoilers, I will not go in detail about what sort of puzzles there are as most of the puzzles are only used once in the game. So you can expect plenty of different types of puzzles in the game.\\n\\nThere are forest sections in the game, the inside of different buildings sections, underwater sections, there’s even underground sections. Some sections such as a test lab and other various environments can be found in the game, all of which look beautiful. You also get to play as a different character(s), at the end of the game, I won’t say which to avoid spoilers. The game is said to have 2 endings but I have only seen the one which was quite weird to be honest.\\n\\nA short gameplay video can be found below, though I’d advice not to watch it if you are planning on buying as it will spoil some part of the game for you.\\n\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=741640250\\n\\n[b][u]Graphics: 10/10[/u][/b]\\n[b][u]Sound: 9/10[/u][/b]\\n[b][u]Gameplay: 9/10[/u][/b]\\n[b][u]Overall: 9/10[/u][/b]\\n\\n[u][b][h1]Conclusion:[/h1][/b][/u]\\n\\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous to look at and sounds incredible. It’s an experience you most likely won’t forget soon. Simply said, it’s a masterpiece and a must play for people who like atmospheric and tense games. People who enjoyed Limbo will definitely enjoy this game too. The game is pretty short, about 3 hours of gameplay total, so if you think the price is high for that much content you can always wait for a sale and get the game when it’s cheaper.',\n",

They tell the story without any dialogue or cutscenes and it\\'s just spectacular, there is a part where you need to act like a zombie in another word \"Playdead\"! you can feel the danger of the environment by the boy Panting, you can feel that he is scared but he has strong will to finish his task, no matter what challenges come in front of him. the puzzles are good and were made with a lot of effort and they are really challenging.

Some of the best puzzle design I have ever seen in a platformer, rounded up with that sense of mystery and amazing sound design that Playdead is known for with their first game, Limbo.\\n\\nSpeaking of, whereas in Limbo the game was focused on trial&error death traps, Inside has a more elaborate puzzle design where only rarely do you feel like you died or failed a sequence because the game was holding a crucial piece from you. Therefore comparisons to the former game should be made carefully, Inside is a much more invested platformer. It's an experience that I'll never forget and that I can't really talk about in detail because it is best seen for yourself. Inside is more than the sum of its parts.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"INSIDE is the follow-up game of Playdead, a small Danish developer company whose previous title was Limbo. You immediately notice the monochromatic approach they decided to continue with here. Colours are not restricted to mainly black and white, though, as in Limbo, however, it is still a dark game.\\n\\nAgain, similarities with Limbo: the protagonist is a boy who ventures into a dangerous environment. This time it's all about a facility with lots of scientists, weird machinery / equipment and dozens of zombie-like people who appear to be part of a dark project. The game does not have an intro or any text explaining the background - you have to put it together yourself. \\n\\nControls are once again very simple: we can basically walk around, climb, swim when underwater and grab things to either interact with levers or pull boxes or open up heavy, metallic doors. Occasionally we can put on a helmet - these are the more interesting parts of the game (puzzle-wise) as by using such a device we can control other humanoids. A later section requires the boy to use a small submarine to cross an underwater level.\\n\\nMusic is minimalistic - emphasis is mainly on the environmental sound. The entire game looks very surreal; something that is a bit Orwellian, very much dystopian. In terms of genre I would consider it sci-fi-horror. Similarly to Limbo the game takes a couple of hours to complete - interestingly, achievements are not related, at all, to game completion but to finding secret orb generators we have to turn off. This adds to the mysteries surrounding the game's story.\\n\\nINSIDE is a great puzzle-platformer from the creators of Limbo; it looks prettier, has more interesting puzzles and it has a very interesting lore. Highly recommended!\",\n",

The high-fidelity, low-complexity aesthetic works extremely well. Animation-wise, it reminds me of two other classics -- the original Prince of Persia (1989) and Another World (1991). And they haven't used a single spoken or written word in the game -- everything is expressed visually. To sum up, this is a must-play.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"I believe that human's imagination is one of the most powerful tools in the universe. With that tool and some professional knowledges aboard you can invent whatever you want and make the world progress faster. You can come up with the best ideas regarding plots and scenarios, you can think out the toughest mysteries and puzzles. The possibilities are countless, or even better say, infinite.\\n\\nThat was exactly the thought I was thinking about all the time while playing this little masterpiece. Everything what I saw in there blew my mind from the first seconds and couldn't let me go until the final scene. After that, I needed an extra hour to recover, 'cause it was simply terrifying and crazy.    \\nMy speech about human's brain wasn't just another random thought, it has a direct connection to this game. The trick is that in this game everything you see and experience - it's all about how you accept it and how you interpret the story. Game is so much full of mystery feel and completely dark and scary atmosphere, telling you the story without a single word, which is incredible and gives you space for the speculation\\n\\nSame as Limbo (previous developer's game), you play as a little boy and the game starts with a runaway from dogs and guards. From the first moments of game play I realized that I am playing a really quality product. The movement of the character was sooooo smooth and animation was done so damn good, that it really satisfied me a lot while I was playing. I was sure, that the plot will start to open itself in a one hour maximum and I will start to understand what's going on there. Damn, how wrong I was..\\n\\nI mean, the game doesn't tell you anything directly, you've got to come to it by yourself and that what makes this game a masterpiece. However, you don't have to be supersmart to understand everything what this game tries to tell you, I still saw hundreds of different theories about what the hell was going on in that game. All of them sound like a real thing and have a right on living. That's one of the greatest thing I really admire in nowadays indie games - while trying to position itself as a simple 2d platformer Inside brings you a more complex, mysterious, detailed and terrifying universe, full of riddles and unexplainable stuff. Add to this absolutely polished and perfectly designed every level, genius sound effects and excellent work with colors and you will get the Inside. Every simple detail in this little gem looks like it was created with a full attention and done with love. \\n\\nTo be honest, it's almost impossible to describe Inside with words. In this case, you need to try it and experience it to not spoil yourself the whole pleasure. Inside has a completely simple controls, so you will not be distracted from enjoying the art, well designed backgrounds and mysterious plot. Also, it's quite a short game, which can be completed in 4 hours at max, but I really recommend you not to rush and simply enjoy it..\\n\\nOk, let's try to sum everything up! \\nYou should grab this game if you:\\n\\n+ Still never played this masterpiece (such a shame! xD )\\n+ Looking for a decent indie game\\n+ Dull atmospheric games with a mystic feel is your thing\\n+ Have a good taste in games\\n+ Like this WTF feeling in the games, where you have a lot of to think about after the game \\n+ Fan of games with easy achievements, simply beat it and get every single achievement, that's it\\n\\nRecommend to avoid if you:\\n\\n- I noticed a bunch of people were moaning in the negative reviews about the price of the game (~20 USD) for such a small game and content in it! For me it's a complete nonsense, of course, because I believe that in this case you pay for unique experience and terrifying emotions. But if you think that 20 USD is way too much for playing a really good quality product (which is, to be fair, kinda rare thing nowadays) then yeah, that's not for you at all.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n[url=store.steampowered.com/curator/32013470/] Follow my curator's page if you enjoy my reviews and want to stay tuned!

       "    'review': 'I played the demo of INSIDE initially and was immediately astounded at how atmospheric the game was.  This was after playing only a few minutes of gameplay.  \\n\\nThe graphical style is dark throughout but well-defined and moves along really smoothly.  The animations are truly amazing and the sound effects perfectly complement the graphics style.  It\\'s worth turning up the volume, especially low frequencies!!  Later on in the game they make for an awe inspiring experience.\\n\\nWhat I really love about INSIDE is the design of the game.  So many \"Puzzle Platformers\" try to increase apparent content by using puzzles requiring repetition or forcing the player to revisit earlier areas.  There is none of that in INSIDE.  The game evolves nicely into unique undefined sections, the gameplay never becomes stale or repetitive.\\n\\nSome may say the downside of this is a fairly short completion time, it should take around three hours or so.  I\\'d MUCH prefer to have three+ hours of quality, non-repetitive, intriguing gameplay than rehashed puzzles/zone/etc padding it out into six or seven hours of frustrating boredom!\\n\\nI\\'ve had the game only a few days and nearly completed a second playthrough.  It\\'s such an enjoyable experience to replay, this is the genius of the design.\\n\\nThe puzzles aren\\'t pitched at a high difficulty level, they\\'re just right to be enjoyable and not to have to resort to searching the interweb for solutions.\\n\\nThe game never explains itself, I really enjoy this ambiguity.  When the game ended, I felt it was right.  It feels like a work of art, not just due to how it presents itself visually but the emotion it leaves you with at the end.\\n\\nThis could possibly be my GOTY 2016.  I need more time for everything to really sink in.  It is though, without doubt a masterpiece!',\n",

       "    'review': 'Phew, Inside is quite an... experience.\\n\\nIs it as good as people are saying it is? Yes and no. Yes, it deserves high praise and it\\'s truly an incredible game. But no, it isn\\'t the \"second coming of Christ\" of the video game world. It\\'s a game that I enjoyed greatly, but it\\'s not for everyone.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s get this out of the way. Inside is absolutely GORGEOUS. Although one could argue that it\\'s drab/dull, this was intended and it was executed really well in my eyes. When you add the really clever camera angles, you have one of the prettiest games that 2016 has to offer. However, I do have one complaint, and that being that sometimes I had trouble distinguishing things that were important to the puzzle or whatever from random things in the background. It got annoying in some cases, but luckily it doesn\\'t take much away from the overall experience.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n\\nAn interesting bit to Inside is that it doesn\\'t use one gimmick throughout the game, for example Undertale\\'s mercy option and Superhot\\'s \"time only moving when you move\" mechanic. Instead, Inside has different ways to solve puzzles, and once you think you know all of the tricks to puzzles, something new is thrown your way. It may seem annoying, but it actually worked really well here. Everything felt fresh and interesting, not to mention that the controls are very tight. It all adds up for a great time in the gameplay department.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\n\\nWhile most aspects to the game are very high quality, this and the audio are probably the best things to Inside. The story to Inside is fascinating and will keep you interested from start to finish, while also keeping you on the edge of your seat. I don\\'t want to say much about it, however, because Inside is a game you need to experience yourself.\\n\\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\\n\\nAs I said, this and the story are the two best things to Inside. The music fits very well when it plays, but where the audio truly shines is the sound effects and ambience. It makes everything so much more thrilling and creepy, and I love it. I think it\\'s a fair argument that Inside has some of the best use of sound in a video game to date, because it\\'s one of the reasons why I love the game.\\n\\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is where Inside isn\\'t so strong. There isn\\'t much replayability to be had aside from a few \"things\" that are best left to be discovered for yourself, but the game itself lasts about 3-4 hours for a normal run, But that being said, the impact this game could have you could be significant and it might be embedded in your memory for quite a while. This game is definitely capable of such a thing.\\n\\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\\n\\nAs I said, Inside is an incredible game that you should experience, but note that it isn\\'t the second coming of Christ, nor will it appeal to everyone. That being said, if this game even at least remotely interests you, then I say go and buy it. You won\\'t regret it.\\n\\n[b]Graphics[/b] - 9/10\\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - 9/10\\n[b]Story[/b] - 10/10\\n[b]Audio[/b] - 10/10\\n[b]Replayability[/b] - 4/10\\n\\n[b].:9.0/10:.[/b]\\n[b]\"Amazing\"[/b]\\n\\n+Outstanding use of audio and atmosphere\\n+Gorgeous graphics\\n+Thrilling story from start to finish\\n+Constantly adds new gameplay elements\\n+Great camerawork\\n\\n-Can be hard to distinguish items from one another\\n-Lacks replayability',\n",

       "    'review': 'Video Review: https://youtu.be/d34IbLt9ldA\\n\\nThis is one of those games that... wow. When you think of \"games as art\" this is definitely one that should be on the list: the change between cramped claustrophobic quarters to expansive rooms, the simple art style that can convey so much information, the fluidity of movement of every character, and most importantly the way it can tell such a deep story with such basic elements.\\n\\nA very deep, very confusing story. Seriously, even if I wanted to write a spoiler review there is no way I could do that. This game is… it’s messed up.\\n\\nYou play a nameless faceless boy running through the forest, hiding behind stumps while trying to avoid a search party out looking for him. It’s shocking from jump because there are a bunch of dudes, armed with rifles that fire tranq darts and hey real bullets because why not, and attack dogs. Clearly something is up with this kid. The weird part is, that he’s not trying to get away – he’s trying to break INSIDE this facility. Get it? I think that’s the point right? But really WHO KNOWS BECAUSE GAH WHAT JUST HAPPENED??\\n\\nImmediately you are pushed into this expansive complex after breaking through their walls, barbed wire, and attack pigs. Yeah you heard me. This is not the weirdest thing you are going to experience, so just hold the hell on.\\n\\nInside the buildings you run into more guards, more dogs, weird creatures, mind control, telepathy, submarines, and… let’s just say that they clearly consulted David Cronenberg for certain levels. I mean… Jesus.\\n\\nThis is a horror game in the sense of the movies Se7en and Misery. The fear is from the story, from the environment, from the ambience that the whole thing provides. The suspense is not knowing what the hell is coming next, but also not being able to stop playing. There are no jump scares, no slavering beats… the fear is simply the unknown. The grey washed out color scheme, but featuring a little kid in a red shirt. The faceless adults going about their business, lining people up and loading them into cages.\\n\\nThe light, as it grows dim the deeper you dive into the murky waters, until there is simply nothing left but your faint silhouette.\\n\\nUltimately the game conveys the story of a boy who is completely, inextricably alone but is pushed further and further into this weird… Aperture Science type place.\\n\\nRating: Stayed up 2 out 5 five hours past bed time. One of those lying awake in the dark, staring at the ceiling, filled with creeping existential dread.\\n\\nGo play this right now.\\n\\nFull review and more at basedgamer.com/@Morlock',\n",

       "    'review': \"[h1] Inside the darkest depths[/h1]\\n\\nInside is a dark and thrilling platformer from Playdead studios who made Limbo.\\n\\nNot gonna speak about the story, the game is pretty short and I think you need to experience everything by yourself. The story is pretty dark so for those who prefer darker games with a message and meaning this is a perfect choice.\\n\\nYou play as a boy similarly to Limbo and traverse through levels in side scrolling manner. I personally prefer this game to Limbo just because Inside feels more of a narrative game rather than puzzle/platforming game. Puzzles are much easier and levels have more variety so for those like me who prefer to put story in the first place it's definitely a better game.\\n\\nThere are puzzles of course and some of them may be quite challenging but nothing like Limbo where at some points game became frustrating.\\nPlatforming sections are easier too so both puzzles and platforming do not distract you from the story and doesn't break the flow of the gameplay. I hate when that happens.\\n\\nGraphically it looks stunning. The graphics are pretty simple but everything is presented and a beautiful artistic style which makes the whole game including every single section look very pretty with its overall aesthetics.\\n\\nThere's not much music in this, music is kind of ambient and combined with other ambient sounds it creates an awesome atmosphere which is tense, horrifying and thrilling.\\n\\nA must have game for...i guess most people who see games as art.\\n\\n[b]Pros[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]Great atmosphere\\n[*]Amazing artistic style\\n[*]Dark\\n[*]Sounds fit nicely into every section and moment\\n[*]Platforming is fun\\n[*]Good puzzles\\n[/list]\\n[b]Cons[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*]-\\n[/list]\\n\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]\",\n",

       "    'review': 'I don\\'t make reviews, but I have to comment this.\\nIt\\'s really good. When you go to play I recommend to you emerge completely in the game. Sit back comfortably, turn off the lights and put on good headphones. That makes all the difference. My congratulations to all who made the audio because without it the game wouldn\\'t be the same. You play paying close attention to the sounds, they make you apprehensive and when you notice, the beat at the background of the sound is actually your heart. Fans of LIMBO will not be disappointed. The graphics are great, the puzzles are engaging, you sleep thinking about the game. I particularly LOVED this game, it is in the atmosphere style that I enjoy and I really like the games that don\\'t need much to impress and make you recommend. Simple in gameplay, in controls, but I felt it to be somewhat philosophical and critical, not just a puzzle. You love and hate some things in him. I\\'ve already been impressed by being a child who goes through things that you think \"is just a child\" and \"WHAT?\". I\\'m a student of game design so yes, I noticed everything you did, every detail. Wet, dry, movements (that by the way looks great!), the backgrounds, sonoplasty, among other things that I don\\'t want to give spoiler for who read. I finished the game and thought \"Oh, was too short ... I wish played more ...\". Reflecting about this I can affirm that the time is perfect. Unless this would be too short and more than that would be too long for the kind of game. It really impresses me when a game of simple appearance shows us to be much more and makes success with it. Another peculiarity is that it isn\\'t realistic in graphics, but there are events that reminds you that the character is human, hasn\\'t power, has human conditions, is mortal. And why a face?? If you actually counts what happens INSIDE. So in this aspect he became very realistic. And this only proves that games can be very good without having to be as realistic as possible in the graphics, without looking like a movie. Congratulations for the game, I recommend it!\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\nNão sou de fazer review mas esse eu tenho que comentar.\\nÉ realmente bom. Quando for jogar recomendo emergir completamente no game. Sente-se confortavelmente, apague as luzes e coloque bons fones. Isso faz toda a diferença. Meus parabéns à quem bolou todo o áudio, por que sem isso o jogo não seria o mesmo. Você joga prestando muita atenção aos sons, eles te deixam apreenssivo e quando você nota, a batida no fundo do som na verdade é seu coração. Fãs de LIMBO não vão se decepcionar. Os gráficos são ótimos, os puzzles são envolventes, você dorme pensando no jogo. Eu particularmente AMEI esse jogo, é no estilo de atmosfera que eu curto e super aprecio os jogos que não precisam de muito para impressionar e te fazer recomendar. Simples na jogabilidade, nos controles, mas senti que é um tanto filosófico e crítico, não apenas um puzzle. Você ama e odeia certas coisas nele. Já comecei me impressionando por ser uma criança que passa por coisas que você pensa \"é só uma criança\" e \"O QUE?\". Sou estudante de design de games então sim, eu notei tudo o que vocês fizeram, cada detalhe. Molhado, seco, movimentos (que a propósito ficaram ótimos!), os backgrounds, sonoplastia, entre outras coisas que não quero dar spoiler para quem ler. Terminei o jogo e pensei \"poxa foi muito curto... queria ter jogado mais...\". Refletindo sobre isso posso afirmar que o tempo é perfeito. Menos que isso seria muito curto e mais do que isso seria muito longo para o tipo de jogo. Realmente me impressiona quando um jogo de aparência simples nos mostra ser bem mais e faz sucesso com isso. Outra peculiaridade é que ele não é realista nos gráficos, mas tem acontecimentos que te faz lembrar que o personagem é humano, não tem um poder, tem condições humanas, é mortal. E para quê um rosto? Se na realidade conta o que acontece INSIDE (dentro). Então nesse aspecto ele cumpriu muito com o \"realista\". E isso só prova que os jogos podem sim ser muito bons sem ter que ser o mais realista possível nos gráficos, sem parecer um filme. Parabéns pelo game, recomendo!',\n",

       "    'review': 'Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\\n\\nFull disclosure: review copy provided by the developer/publisher!\\n\\nWhen I think “indie games” a few come to mind: Super Meat Boy, Braid, World of Goo, and Limbo. Limbo came out way, WAY back in 2010; back when nighttime television audiences were torn between Team Coco and Team Jayjay, iPads roamed wild and free, and vuvuzelas were declared auditory torture devices. Other stuff happened too, but I\\'ve been very successful in repressing Glee and I don\\'t want those memories rushing back now.\\n\\nOh, and Limbo came out to critical acclaim and commercial success during Xbox Live\\'s Summer of Arcade. It was a 2D puzzle-platformer where you navigated, well, “limbo” in a minimalistic, film noir looking world. Simple, intuitive controls, breathtaking visuals, and an eerie ambient soundtrack made Limbo a darling in the video game world to critics and gamers alike.\\n\\nSix years later (almost to the day, spooky!), the very same devs have released INSIDE, a... 2D puzzle-platformer.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nBut like Frictional Games has shown, sometimes it works to stick to (and improve on) what you know. Playdead has improved on Limbo\\'s simple formula in every conceivable way resulting in something I didn\\'t think was possible: a better Limbo, and six years later to boot... that\\'s like improving the wheel far as I\\'m concerned. \\n\\nINSIDE is the really messed up, feature length Pixar movie you control and didn\\'t know you wanted but you definitely do – and I mean that in the best way possible.\\n\\nINSIDE has you playing as Red Shirt (Christened thusly by me because of his distinct red shirt and his propensity for dying a lot), a little boy hanging out on the wrong side of an Orwellian industrial “has-science-gone-too-far” allegory. You traverse the bleak, twisted world, solving a wide variety of logic and physics puzzles much like Limbo before it (pull this crate, climb this rope, press this button, etc.). Unlike Limbo, however, the most memorable moment isn\\'t blown in the first 20 minutes of the title... no, this one left my mouth gaping in awe beginning, middle, and end. It never stopped surprising me.\\n\\nThe story is far more successful than Limbo\\'s minimalist tale; Playdead delivers the story in much the same way but it\\'s far more sinister and compelling this time around. \"Hunted and alone, Red Shirt finds himself drawn into the center of a dark project.\" That\\'s all Playdead gives you, and that\\'s all you need. The environment and denizens of this Aperture Science Gone Extra Combustible Lemon Wrong happily fills in the rest.\\n\\nIn the three hours it took me to complete INSIDE I never felt the dark whimsy dissipate... the creep crept, and the weird waited, and the bizarre beckoned. Every time I thought, “no, things can\\'t get more strange, more DIRE than THAT,” Playdead indisputably proved me wrong. In the three hours it took me to complete INSIDE I never felt the puzzles get samey... Playdead introduced a new mechanism, a new horror, a new scenario that would require some reevaluation. But I never felt stuck or frustrated as it all made sense in the confines of INSIDE\\'s world, and I maintained a pretty steady clip from start to finish.\\n\\nIn short, buy INSIDE if you love Limbo; buy INSIDE if you love atmospheric puzzlers; buy INSIDE if you love video games: it\\'s an instant classic. The controls are tight, simple, and intuitive, the atmosphere is incredible, the story is excellent, and the puzzles are inspired. Everything about this game is stellar, and it\\'s not one to be missed. \\n\\nINSIDE is easily a contender for Indie GOTY.\\n\\n... \\n\\nShit, I remembered Glee happened.',\n",

       "    'review': '[h1] A wordless story that leaves you wordless [/h1]\\n\\nINSIDE is one of those gems every one should put on their radar (and this comes from a person who disliked Little Nightmares). I’m not a fan of puzzle-platform games with trial and error gameplay but this one is quite forgiving and easy, making room for lesser frustration. Briefly, INSIDE’s strongest points are its linearity, simple controls and delightfully spooky atmosphere as well as the creativeness of the puzzles.\\n\\nThe gameplay is more focused on puzzle-solving than survival so instead of introducing ”sh*t your pants” type of scares, you’ll be immersed into a creepy, atmospheric world with artistic graphics and ideas that will chill you to the bone. That is to say, there is still a bit of sneaking and escaping, and you must have an understanding of the perfect timing to make a successful getaway, otherwise you’ll end up like mushed potatoes. \\n\\nAlso, the way the game’s narrative conveys itself without words is mind-blowing. Despite the main character’s silence, I sympathized with him very much – there’s no need for words when you see the world around him. So I recommend INSIDE for basically everyone out there. It’s short and while it gets a bit repetitive towards the end, it’s worth every cent.\\n\\n[b] Graphics [/b]\\n☐ Stunning\\n☑ Beautiful\\n☐ Good\\n☐ Decent\\n☐ Jumble of pixels\\n\\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\\n☑ Super fun\\n☐ Enjoyable\\n☐ Normal\\n☐ Boring\\n☐ Don’t fall asleep\\n\\n[b] Audio [/b]\\n☐ Eargasm\\n☑ Amazing\\n☐ Good\\n☐ Not horrible\\n☐ Better without headphones\\n\\n[b] PC Requirements [/b]\\n☐ Potato\\n☑ Medium\\n☐ Fast\\n☐ Ask NASA for a spare computer\\n\\n[b] Difficulty [/b]\\n☐ Piece of cake\\n☑ Easy (some puzzles are harder tho)\\n☐ Average\\n☐ Difficult\\n☐ Very difficult\\n\\n[b] Story [/b]\\n☐ No story\\n☐ Some lore\\n☐ Average\\n☐ Good\\n☑ Masterpiece\\n\\n[b] Length [/b]\\n☐ Super short (0-2 h)\\n☑ Short (2-6 h)\\n☐ Average (6-10 h)\\n☐ Long (10+)\\n☐ Endless\\n\\n[b] Price [/b]\\n☐ Free\\n☑ Worth the price\\n☐ Buy it on sale\\n☐ If you have extra money\\n☐ Not recommended\\n\\n[b] Bugs [/b]\\n☑ No\\n☐ Minor\\n☐ Annoying\\n☐ Too much\\n☐ The game itself is a bug\\n\\n[b] Replayability [/b]\\n☐ No replay value\\n☑ Maybe once\\n☐ Multiple times\\n☐ Infinite replayability\\n\\n[b] Scariness [/b]\\n☐ Try not to yawn\\n☑ Has its moments\\n☐ Very scary/tense\\n☐ Nightmare\\n\\n[h1] 9/10 [/h1]',\n",

One person could take this as a simple story about a kid resisting a world fallen into a world controlled by a mysterious group. While others may see this as a message of individualism, and how we as a species must come together to recognize and celebrate our differences. \\nYou may have noticed that I have only 5 hours in this game. It is indeed a short game. My playthrough was probably long too considering how much of a dumbass I am when it comes to puzzles and navigation. But this game has a lot to say in those 4-5 hours and what\\'s more impressive is it says it all with no dialogue what so ever. You watch this games story unfold before your very eyes as you venture deeper into it\\'s unique world. The art style is perfect for the game, being very simplistic yet shows you everything you need to see. It all creates an atmosphere only rivaled by some of the top games ever put out. It is that atmosphere which is my favorite part of the game. Each environment is unique, with it\\'s own secrets to reveal. The game is a sad game, so that emotion is in every second of the atmosphere. They all make you wonder, \"what was happening here before whatever happened, happened?\" . And once you reach the climax, that atmosphere, and the messages of individualism, all come together to make for one hell of a closing act. \\nSPOILERS: The huge world, that loomed over you for the entire game, pushing you into corners, keeping you in the dark and shadows. You finally break free, and see the sun for the first time as the credits roll. A truly special game.',\n",

Sounds like Limbo does it not? \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\n\\nLike its predecessor Limbo, Inside is a straight forward 2D puzzle platformer with seamlessly incorporated environmental traps and challenges. They flow perfectly into the game that is free of any immersion breaking cut scenes.\\n\\nFrom simpler traversal of objects to controlling a a little water sub-marine and more complicated control of machinery. They never interrupt the narrative or feel forced into the game, a welcomed evolution from its older brother, Limbo. \\n\\nInside has more colour, offering a more realistic approach than Limbo but the game remains dark, giving the entire thing a bleak look. The brighter back drops stand out and contrast with a world mostly overcast by decay and destruction. Abandoned buildings, dark forests, deep, murky waters. There’s beauty in this visual style.\\n\\nIn a similar fashion, the audio is unique in style. Harrowing, flashes of music underscoring the distinct sounds of gushing rain, loud machinery, or running footsteps or the crushing of bones and flesh...\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\n\\nSimilar to Limbo there is something more to the troubles of traversing the puzzles in the boys path. The narrative is minimal, only via environmental details. \\n\\nThe protagonist is apparently on the run but the world and its inhabitants are unforgiving and take no mercy on the fragile little boy, dropped all alone into a hostile place. A society has enslaved people and is using them against their will- as you go deeper inside you will find something distrubing and surreal. \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Uncompromising atmosphere\\n[*]Cleverly incorporated puzzles\\n[*]Puzzles are diverse, not repetitive or frustrating\\n[*]Flawless, clean 2.5D visuals\\n[*]Top notch sound and music\\n[*]Achievement / collectibles as an extra reward [/list]\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[b]CONS:[/b] \\n[list]\\n[*]Game length, to whom it matters; Inside can be finished in 5 hrs if you're in a hurry\\n[*](Much less of a problem than Limbo) A few unforgiving trial and error puzzles\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\n\\nInside improves upon every aspect of Limbo. Improved visuals, design, enemies and puzzles. It is a fun adventure.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"Easily a new favourite game, my #1 of the year. Can't stop thinking about it. \\n\\nI absolutely adored INSIDE. I’ve played several platformers lately that were more frustrating than not or had super bland, stereotypical puzzles. This one reminded me why I love puzzle platformers so much. It had such fluid controls and interesting puzzles, not too difficult but still made you think. The game overall felt really slick and was so atmospheric (surprisingly scary at times), gorgeous, clever…cannot recommend enough!\\n\\nI knew nothing about the story going into it and I advise you do the same.\",\n",

It is fully worth the $20 in my opinion, it's short, but what you get is amazing.\\n\\nGraphics and art: Inside has a very simple, dark, and brooding art style, that will immerse and intrigue you.\\n\\nControls: simple, precise and in my opinion are best used with a controller and to relax.\\n\\nGameplay: Puzzles ranging from very simple, to extremely difficult, mainly that is what the \\ngameplay is focused on, so if you're a puzzle fan, you'll love it.\\n\\nStory: Deep, dark, confusing, and full of twists, it's an amazing story that will keep you guessing till the end.\\n\\nPerformance: Runs great, low system requirements, can be run on even my friends old toaster PC.\\n\\nSound: Extremely well done, everything sounds crisp and clear.\\n\\n(One more thing, try and get all the acheveiments, it unlocks a secret ending that will help explain alot about the story.)\\n\\n[h1]Overall score: 9/10[/h1]\\n\\nIf you're a puzzle or 2D fan, or liked Limbo, this is highly recommended, a beautiful, intriguing story and world, filled with twists.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"I will try and keep this short, because truthfully half the fun of Inside is knowing next to nothing about it. You play as an unnamed, faceless character probably best just called “Boy,” who is on the run in some sort of weird dystopian industrial hellscape where he’s pursued by men with hunting dogs. The goal is to avoid death or capture, and though there isn’t a “story” per se, you will be introduced to an exceedingly bizarre world full of monsters both friendly and hostile.\\n\\nFor me Inside stands out because it's platforming gameplay make use of the basics and lets just say it makes use of them amazingly. It’s pretty simple, really. You run and you jump, you pull levers and open doors, you push crates and swing on chains. Sometimes, the game introduces specific mechanics, like where you have uh, “allies” that assist you with certain tasks, and there’s even a vehicle segment. But there’s no overriding gimmick, nor does your character level up or gain new abilities.\\n\\nThe puzzles are difficult enough to be interesting, but simple enough not to be frustrating. Some of my favorite segments included the use of “allies” to complete tasks, and I also really enjoyed outsmarting enemies that are out to kill you.\\n\\nThe game’s core appeal is probably not in its mechanics, but its art style and atmosphere, which creates haunting, sprawling areas which bring life to this strange but wonderful world. You, as “Boy,” will meet some violent ends, however. I was ripped apart by dogs, strangled by guards, blown into pieces by sonic blasts and shredded by underwater fans to the point where I could see my 2D intestines streaming out of my body. So in short, watch out.\\n\\nThe ending sequence is one of the most wonderfully bizarre things I’ve ever seen in a game, and to say any more would be a crime, as it’s just something you have to experience for yourself.\\n\\nThe game is very short. I beat it in just under four hours but I probably could have done it in less time had a few puzzles not tripped me up for extended periods of time. And while I like the sense of mystery that surrounds the world of the game, I would have liked a few more clues as to what on earth was going on in this world, but the game offers you exactly nothing which adds to the overally mystery of the game. I suppose that’s its own sort of fun and part of the concept’s appeal.\\n\\nSo to conclude Inside is an incredible game, a compelling artistic achievement that deserves your time no matter what genre of game you would normally play or prefer. I wish there was a little bit more to it, but between the gameplay, the animation and the atmosphere, it’s enough to be a worthwhile experience. Playdead have earned my attention, and they should have yours too.\",\n",

       "    'review': \"INSIDE is a 2.5D psychological puzzler from Play Dead studios. The game is an evolution of the studio’s previous game, Limbo. If you played Limbo, then you know the type of harrowing experience lies in front of you. If not, then you are in for one of the most atmospheric games ever made.\\n\\nThe game starts with a boy dropping down into what it seems like a forest. As you slowly make your way across the forest, the first thing you notice is your footsteps. There is no music, no dialog; all you hear is your footsteps echoing across your path. This drives home one of the most important themes of the game; isolation. You start with an avalanche of questions; you get some answers along your path, but more pop up. This is a dystopian world, which is open to self-interpretation with no guided narrative. I have a feeling this is intentionally designed. The boy, just like the player, has no idea what is going on. This helps the player to connect with the boy and in-turn, get a more authentic feeling of the world around them. Inside focuses all its attention to this level of environmental storytelling and it works ever so well. Where most games put you on the shoes of a capable super soldier of some kind. Being a lonely boy in a dystopian world such as this makes you feel more vulnerable and careful with every move you make. \\n\\nYou will be doing a good mix of platforming and puzzle solving. The controls are not designed to be precise but are more wobbly; this makes perfect sense in relation to the player-controlled protagonist. The platforming therefore do not ask more from the player than it is possible with the controls. Puzzles do not seem to be designed to challenge players and more importantly, beyond the capabilities of the boy, but injected as another core storytelling delivery. Being so fragile in such a hostile world, regular deaths is pretty much guaranteed. Observant players however can avoid many of these deaths, as the game drops down hints leading up to a kill-zone.  \\n\\nI love horror games in general. Where most horror games tend to use superficial themes; such as zombies, ghosts, aliens, etc. Playdead games tend to stick to more realistic and peculiar tones, which players can better connect. The game ends up peaking our curiosity while raising our heart beat at the same time. This is something what I like to call Genuine Horror which is, at least to me, is the most effective flavor of horror. \\n\\nThe game is a big upgrade over the silhouette-style of their previous game, Limbo. The visuals no longer follow the style of its forebear, but go for a more realistic but still stylistic tone. The sound played a huge role in Limb, and continues to do for Inside. The sound production and design is incredible to the point it is hard to believe it is an indie game. Animation beautifully meshes them together. It goes for double duty by amplifying the narrative further by making the boy feel more like a boy than just a small protagonist with all the nuances you would expect from a kid. \\n\\nThere used to be a time where videogames used to surprise me. They were an emotional rollercoaster ride. However as I grew up, these things became clichés and forgot those feelings I had when playing a game. Inside is one of the very few games after so many years, which managed to wake up those dormant experiences. \\n\\nInside is not a long game and I am glad the studio did not stretch it out and sacrifice the pacing as a result. Had I played this game last year, it would have been my game of the year. \\n\\n10/10 - I can't think of any flaw in this game\",\n",

       "    'review': 'You\\'re probably wondering why you have to buy a game that can be completed in less than 4 hours.\\nDon\\'t wonder. Go ahead and buy the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a weired experience, I can\\'t explain. But it\\'s rewarding! After finishing the game, I don\\'t even have clue what this game\\'s all about. Far more than Limbo, this game tells you nothing why these stuffs happen, which has lead to various theories online.\\n\\nAnd one which I prefer is this:\\n\\n[[\\nI believe the purpose of the game is to explore the relationship between game developers, players, and the avatars that said players control. Think about it: Who is in control of the game while it plays? You would think the Player is in control, since they\\'re the one guiding the boy. But in fact, it is the developers who are controlling the Players by manipulating where they can go; setting the rules and laying out the physics of the game. The entire world of the game is one giant obstacle course planned out to the last detail - this becomes apparent at the end of the game once we see the diorama that shows the last frame of the narrative. This is a hint to the Player that they are in fact, being controlled even as they control the Boy. The scenes of dystopia, especially the scene where the Boy is forced to jump in unison with the other drones, serve to emphasize the Players lack of control and the paradox that,even though the player might seem all-powerful, they\\'re still being guided and controlled by a higher power. (The Devs). The \"special ending\" reveals the way to escape the Developer\\'s Control - by pulling out the cord that supplies the Boy with power. Unfortunately, this also ends the game. Likewise, in the regular ending, once the Blob comes to rest at the bottom of the hill, the Player loses control over it, and this of course, happens right before the ending. \\n\\nThis makes you think: how much control do you have over your real life? How much of what you go through - the beliefs you hold, the job you work - has been constructed by others in an attempt to manipulate you into doing their bidding? Who are the \"Game Devs\" of Real Life? It seems like a silly question, but then you watch Documentaries like Adam Curtis\\' \"Century of the Self\" and realize that governments and corporations have (since the 20th century,)  put a great deal of resources into researching ways to manipulate the public. How we vote, what we buy, what we learn in school, all of these are guided by the massive amount of Social Engineering that has been directed at the average citizen. \\n\\n Maybe this game was a warning to us to pay attention. That to be free, we must \"unplug ourselves\" even if it means we are cast out of the system that currently seems to encompass our existence.\\n]] (copy pasted this from Reddit, sorry I didn\\'t note down it\\'s original author.',\n",

       "    'review': \"Inside is a 2D side-scroller game (but the level design is 3D) where you solve various puzzles to progress to the next setting. As simple as it sounds, the charm of this game is in its atmosphere, artstyle and the overall presentation.\\n\\nGAMEPLAY:\\nThe controls are simple. You can move, jump and grab. The level design is 3D but you are confined to move in 2D directions. Very masterfully, the game uses only these to create a fun and memorable experience. Most of the game consist of various puzzles which you require to solve to progress further in the game. The puzzles are average with a few requiring out of the box thinking. (Now, puzzle difficulty is a very subjective topic and everyone can have different opinions on it.)  Remember that you may die a lot in some of these puzzle. Many of these are based on dying and learning from your mistakes.\\nThere are many sequences in the game which require you to perform certain acts with amazing timing and the stress and thrill experienced in those sequences is where the game shines.\\n\\nSTORY:\\nOne thing about Inside is that there is no hand holding. When you first start the game, you are given no instructions. It's all up to you to figure out. The story in this game is also similar. Without any dialogues and only through the various settings you come across in this game, the game tries to tell a very deep story. The story is intentionally open-ended, leaving to the player to interpret the story in their own ways. After completing the game, Inside stays with you for some more time as you try to comprehend whatever you experienced while playing it. One may need to play through the game more than once to observe and understand what is actually going on in the game world (it really helps to play more than once to try to fit everything in the story). I will not give any story spoilers but I would like to inform you (so that you don't miss it), this game also has an alternate ending (find it on your own). I would urge you to go through both endings as the alternate ending plays a major part in shaping the story of the game.\\n\\nGRAPHICS:\\nThis game really looks good. Each setting is beautifully designed and the color palette used gives the game a certain mood. I overall don't have any complains in this regard. (Do note that you shouldn't expect realistic graphics. This game has a certain artistic style which makes it what it is)\\n\\nOverall, I would like to RECOMMEND this game to anyone looking for great side scroller puzzle solving experience. Yes, this game is an experience. \\n\\nNOTE: This note is for ones who have played Limbo made by the same devs. Be informed that this game is not Limbo 2. There is a great amount of similarity between both these games but there are certain important differences which make both these unique titles. The setting in Limbo was like... 'limbo' while Inside has far more earthly setting. Same goes for the plot. Limbo had better devices to kill you in my opinion. I found Inside a bit easier than Limbo but one shouldn't forget that with Inside, they are trying to tell a far more complex story than Limbo. As someone who had played Limbo, I thoroughly enjoyed Inside.\",\n",

       "    'review': '[b]ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS[/b]\\n\\nWhen it came out in 2010, Limbo became a masterpiece of game design. From its art and sound design, to its sense of atmosphere, to its puzzling gameplay mechanics, and to its ability to tell a story with no words, Limbo was a genre defining moment. Six years later, development studio Playdead is back with Inside, and it has proved Limbo was not a fluke. Inside takes what made Limbo great and runs with it even further, and has added yet another great game to 2016’s ever-growing list. \\n\\nMuch in the same way to its predecessor, Inside is dark and mostly monochrome, although there are splashes of colour here and there, most notably the red top the protagonist wears. Again, you play as a young boy, puzzle-platforming his way through dangerous environments, although here, the dangers are not part of the forest itself as in Limbo, but rather the people chasing you. You’re not really given any sense of why you are where you are, why these people are looking for you, or where you are even going, you just know that you’re going to have to figure out how to survive.\\n\\n[b]DEATH IS INEVITABLE[/b]\\n\\nBut you won’t survive, at least not at first. And when you do die, the added amount of detail in Inside’s character and the extra death animations will leave you shocked, every time it happens. A game has never left my mouth open, aghast, so many times. Whether he’s being ripped apart by dogs or violently smothered by a shadowy man, these deaths are brutal, and you can see how the game got its ‘18’ rating. These moments of horror are not to mention the last section of the game, where the animation and sound effects are exquisitely disgusting, but I won’t give too much away about that. \\n\\nIndeed, if you know you’re going to be playing Inside, it’s worth going into it with as little information as possible. The story is ambiguous enough that you don’t want to be weighed down with other people’s theories before forming your own. It’s not exactly a “water-cooler” game, but you’ll certainly be discussing what you think it all means with your friends, as well as recounting some of the best moments. Perhaps the story is too ambiguous though, as certain moments and the ending in particular will leave you with more questions than answers. \\n\\nInside isn’t exactly hard, although it is quite unfair at some moments. I wouldn’t go as far as saying some of the puzzles are trial and error, but a handful are designed to have you fail so you can figure out how to actually get past them. Puzzle solutions aren’t telegraphed in the environment, but there aren’t any red herrings here. If you can interact with an object, it’ll be part of solving the puzzle, so if you can drag it somewhere, or activate it, or jump over it, you’ll probably figure it out. That’s not to say the puzzles aren’t enjoyable, but you won’t be challenged very much during the 3-4 hours of playtime Inside has in store for you. \\n\\n[b]IT’S ALL ABOUT THE JOURNEY[/b]\\n\\nInstead, it’s all about the journey. You’ll progress through the forest and into a more industrial area, before going somewhere you never thought you’d end up. Once again, Playdead has absolutely nailed the art style and atmosphere, and that alone is enough to push you through to see what’s coming next. The level design is more sprawling than in the game’s predecessor, but you’ll never become lost. Plus, there are nice touches such as objects blending into the background when you’re not using them. If you drag a box somewhere but don’t want to jump onto it yet, you’re not forced to, and you can run right by it. \\n\\nInside isn’t as impressive in terms of the physics based puzzles as Limbo was six years ago, but it doesn’t make them any less enjoyable now. Inside has improved on the genre in other ways, in animation, in subtle yet noticeable level and puzzle design, in the way the game makes you feel while you’re playing it. You may turn up your nose at another game which is viewed as “art” and which doesn’t tell you everything you need to know. That’s fine, but just know you are missing out on yet another wonderful game.\\n\\n[b]PROS[/b]\\nBeautiful art design, great yet simple puzzle and level design.\\n\\n[b]CONS[/b]\\nHighly ambiguous story, some moments are designed for you to fail.\\n\\n[b]My Score: 9/10[/b]',\n",

       "    'review': \"After spending 13 hours 'Inside,' I am not quite sure what to think. On the surface, this is a side-scrolling platform game with some complex puzzles and some very interesting mechanics. The artwork is desolate and dark and you are constantly evading death (which comes in multiple forms... dogs, siren/mermaids, people, guns, falling, etc.).\\n\\nYou guide a small boy through a multi-layered maze-like environment that includes outdoors, indoors, rural, urban, underwater, below ground, etc. Along the way you use boxes, carts, and 'mindless' entities to help clear your path.\\n\\nThe game saves regularly so progress is not usually lost when you die or decide to take a break. Achievements are awarded for finding and unplugging 'dome' structures which are generally reached by detouring off the main path. If you miss one, you can easily return to a previous scene without disrupting your primary game. 100% is achieved well before the actual end of the story. Once you have earned 100%, you have the option of completing the main story, looping back for an alternate ending, or just quitting. The last section of the game involves controlling a rolling ball of flesh and a box of fire which becomes quite tricky. After many tries, I have yet to be successful in completing these final moments. \\n\\nFor those who have played LIMBO, INSIDE is physically easier (i.e., less precision/timing required) but more challenging in terms of some pretty complicated puzzle solutions.  I am not sure what to say about the story. Towards the end, the boy transitions to breathe underwater and to control the 'mindless' entities without technology.  And, then there is the huge ball of flesh with multiple arms and legs (Yikes!). While I suspect that the developers are telling a story with meaning, I admit that it escaped me entirely. There are a couple of interpretations posted on the Steam forum which are interesting to read.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend this to those with patience and who do not mind platforming and watching a child die in multiple ways.  It is an interesting game that is worth your time. If you discover the hidden meaning, please be sure to share it with those of us who are less intuitive!\",\n",
