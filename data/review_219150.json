but you really have to put your brain to work.\nThe controls work nicely on both platforms and together with the brutal action and the beautiful sounding 80's soundtrack I had the greatest difficulty to stop playing.\n\nThe game also works great on a steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGOkMgaKwN8\n\nThe controls and fast action cannot hide the fact that this is really just a puzzle game.\nEnemies behave quite predictably, for example by walking the same circle all the time.\nYou have to think about how best to complete a room full of opponents. Do you throw a beer bottle at someone's head and then knock the other person down, at the risk of being hit yourself?\nOr do you storm into the room with guns at the ready? And if you do fire shots, how do you deal with the mob of guards approaching the noise?\nHotline Miami is the most focused, no nonsense game I've played in years.\nEven the graphics are perfect in that regard: the pixels are detailed enough to show what's happening, but also abstract enough to let you experience the nasty story in your head.\nIn combination with the LSD-like bad trip that the psychedelic electro lets you experience, Hotline Miami is an uncomfortable yet impressive and unforgettable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1693245231, "timestamp_updated": 1693245231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774726569652557373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140017241": {"recommendationid": "140017241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986395717", "num_games_owned": 2195, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1648998765}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami - A Brutal and Stylish Ballet of Violence\n\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReview:\n\nHotline Miami is a heart-pounding, adrenaline-fueled trip into the dark underbelly of the '80s. This top-down shooter from Dennaton Games delivers a relentless onslaught of fast-paced action, mind-bending puzzles, and a pumping synthwave soundtrack that will have you hooked from the very first beat.\n\nSet in the neon-drenched streets of Miami, Hotline Miami places you in the role of a nameless hitman, compelled to carry out a series of brutal and bloody missions. The gameplay is intense and unforgiving, requiring split-second reflexes and a strategic mind to navigate through each level.\n\nWhat sets Hotline Miami apart is its stylish and distinctive aesthetic. The pixelated art style is complemented by vibrant colors, giving the game a retro charm that harks back to the era it pays homage to. The level design is meticulously crafted, with a variety of rooms, hallways, and obstacles that demand tactical thinking and precise execution.\n\nThe combat in Hotline Miami is a beautifully choreographed dance of death. Armed with an array of weapons ranging from shotguns to melee implements, you'll mow down enemies with brutal efficiency. Each kill is satisfyingly visceral, accompanied by splatters of pixelated blood and the thumping soundtrack that sets the pulse racing.\n\nHowever, Hotline Miami isn't just about mindless violence. The game's narrative takes unexpected twists and turns, delving into themes of identity, morality, and the blurred lines between hero and villain. The cryptic story will keep you questioning the events and characters, adding an intriguing layer to the blood-soaked gameplay.\n\nThe soundtrack of Hotline Miami is an absolute standout. The synthwave tunes perfectly capture the essence of the '80s, with their pulsating beats and infectious melodies driving the action forward. The music not only serves as a backdrop but also acts as a motivator, pushing you to push your limits and execute your kills with style.\n\nIt's worth noting that Hotline Miami can be incredibly challenging. Enemies are ruthless and can dispatch you with a single hit, forcing you to adopt a trial-and-error approach as you learn from each death. While this level of difficulty may frustrate some players, the sense of accomplishment when you finally overcome a particularly challenging level is incredibly rewarding.\n\nIn conclusion, Hotline Miami is a violent ballet of mayhem and style. With its unique aesthetic, relentless gameplay, and an unforgettable soundtrack, it's a must-play for fans of fast-paced action and atmospheric storytelling. Just be prepared for a challenge and to lose yourself in the neon-soaked brutality of Hotline Miami's twisted world.", "timestamp_created": 1686689632, "timestamp_updated": 1686689632, "voted_up":

Highlight of the game, for sure. Nothing I can really talk about except for the negatives, as everything else is immaculate.\n\n- Sometimes, bullets pass through enemies and hit the person behind them, or don't register at all.\n\n- Unintentional inconsistencies. When replaying after dying, sometimes an enemy will see you sooner now, or will shoot sooner, or a new enemy who didn't see you before will see you now, even though they are at the same spot as before and looking at the same place, and you are standing in the same place as the last time.\n\n- An intentional inconsistency is that some enemy placement, movement, and weapon type change when retrying after death. So, if you died because someone was to the left of you with a shotgun, restart, now he is further down with a machine gun. I really disliked this.\n\nI wish there was a button to restart from the last checkpoint, instead of just restarting from the beginning of the level. At the moment, I resort to intentionally get hit to go back to the last checkpoint.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\n\nThe second highlight of this game, keeps you sane when retrying levels so many times. Genre is Retro-Synth-Disco?\n\nFeatures some well-known indie artists, although could be in retrospect, as the game could have boosted their careers, I don't know for a fact which is which. All I know is they are some bangers.\n\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\n\nAt first very vague, opens up more later, but still, I needed to read the wiki and watch some explanation videos to get the full picture. I liked it though. Nice mix of straight-forward, vague, simple, and complex.

[/h1]\nHotline Miami has great aesthetic & music (highly recommend buying the soundtrack), but the game is clunky, unfair, & lacks accessibility options.\n\nLike you will have a dialogue window pop up & an enemy will attack you like ~0.2 seconds after it closes, or you will have situations where you just can't damage the enemy because of invincibility frames or wonky hitboxes. Also I seriously cannot tell if my game is bugged or if the game is supposed to be this fast.\n\nLike let me break it down to the issues I remember:\n* You have to hold SHIFT 24/7 or else you can't see where the enemies are or aim effectively.\n* No aiming settings.\n* No option to turn off sway / shake.\n* You die in one hit but enemies sometimes take multiple hits.\n* Very little time given for reactions.\n* Enemies will sometimes know exactly where you are even with their back turned.\n* Enemies instantly aim at you & never really miss.\n* Sometimes enemies don't take damage.\n* Sometimes enemies hit you from farther than they should.\n* Doors block everything & be a nuisance often wasting your ammo.\n* Enemies sometimes blend in with the background.\n* The game hides the ammo meter after a mission making it hard to tell if you picked up a piece of garbage or a loaded weapon, this is an issue on some missions where they throw more enemies at you after a clear.\n* You can't throw weapons at the first boss, but then this rule changes for a later boss where you have to throw a weapon.\n* A boss throws a wall of dialogue at you & attacks immediately after the dialogue ends giving little time to react.\n* Multiple phase bosses / fights (such as when police show up) not being checkpointed; so if you mess up it can be tedious.\n* Arbitrary limits (can't go to certain spots in boss fights or you will be instant killed, certain moves are only working in certain fights / phases, boss fights don't let you bring in weapons).\n* Terrible hitboxes / damage registration.\n\nI would recommend the following over Hotline Miami:\nJydge: 3D, 2 player, customizable.\nSynthetik 1: 2D, Try Synthetik Arena to see if you'd like it.\nSynthetik 2: 3D, (In development will have local co op at a later date).", "timestamp_created": 1692894218, "timestamp_updated": 1696456387, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530685901641845703", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123604555": {"recommendationid": "123604555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259312121", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 847, "last_played": 1652897923}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami is a cool little thing.

thinking that this game is a good little arcade experience worth checking out! The genre is new to me, so it was kinda hard at first to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it was really cool to just kill everyone on sight. Of course I\u2019m against violence in real life but here it feels satisfying just because this game is really dependent on reflexes. And the crunchy sound after killing just makes this all better. The lore I don\u2019t really care for, I just thought it was a good time even though a bit frustrating at times because the AI is very weird. Sometimes they are too smart, sometimes they are too dumb. So this makes being killed by literally the last enemy more rage-inducing. But still, due to this game\u2019s uniqueness (arguably), I can\u2019t really judge it, since it\u2019s also the first entry. And really weird seeing this kind of game released so early, which is probably why it\u2019s so known to the public. If you didn\u2019t play this already, I highly recommend you to do so.

I never even really realized this came out in 2012, so I am very much late to this game and franchise in general, but that just goes to show how truly timeless they are.\n\nHotline Miami is an intentionally confusing game that employs many strange ways to give and take power away from the player, and really makes you ask questions about yourself and your actions. And just before you can really start doubting yourself, the game moves on to a new scene, complete with a late 80's theme and no shortage of gore and violence. The game doesn't shy away from showing you the atrocities you're committing. (Although, this theme is more heavily explored in the sequel).\n\nMoving on to the gameplay. In the past, I've stated that it feels buggy and unpolished, at least compared to the second game. Some of that is true, there are some aspects that are undoubtedly broken (Popular example being picking up weapons through walls). But now that I truly completed the game, I just have to say none of that really matters because the overall experience is amazing. The guns all feel amazing to use, (yes, some are better than others, but there's always a situation perfect for any specific weapon) and the movement is fluid and satisfying to get good at. But, I mean, everything I've said so far can also be said about the second game, so what's so unique about this one? The answer is the level design and the masks. The level design is close-quarters oriented, which can make you sightread rooms more easily and allows you to clear them faster, something very useful considering the combo timer is extremely short. An unintended side effect of this is that weapons, while not being obsolete, tend to lose out to melee in the hands of an experienced player in certain parts of some levels. When it comes to masks, they are a great way to add replayability and uniqueness to any given completion. However, their balance isn't great, some are objectively bad (Richard, Rasmus, Nigel, Oscar and probably others are straight downgrades) and some are extremely busted and make the game far, far easier (Brandon and Zack come to mind here, for finishing levels fast and getting high scores respectively). \n\nThe plot and story of Hotline Miami is extremely difficult to understand and can be interpreted in many ways, all of them having a certain amount of merit. If you play through once, you'll probably not truly understand even 50% of its intricacies and complexity, I felt sort of lost after I beat the game the first time. To add to this, it's extremely difficult to tell if some parts are reality or fiction, given the circumstances. (For example, Jacket is revealed to be in a coma up until chapter 12, making a huge part of the game his dreams, therefore unreliable). All that being said, I will try to explain the main idea in a concise way, while also leaving out the second game for now, since that makes everything 1000x more difficult to string together. And I'm not going to explain the full story, just the beginning. Mainly because there are countless videos that talk about it and also because I don't want to spoil it. The plot focuses around a peaceful patriotic organisation, as they call themselves, named 50 Blessings. Their intentions, however, are far more sinister: they directly oppose the Russo-American coalition, an alliance which formed after San Francisco was bombed by the Soviet Union. Their plan is a bit ambiguous, but basically they send out phone calls to the people who subscribe to their newsletter, instructing them to various locations to slaughter Russian outposts. The main character, Jacket, is seen multiple times killing without remorse or really any emotion; this is probably because he feels no sympathy for Russians after he was in the military in the Russian-American Hawaiian conflict and also because his friend, Beard, died in the bombing of San Francisco. As a result, he continues his killing sprees, which get far more dangerous as time goes on. However, Jacket will soon discover a lot of what he's known is a lie and he will wake up, both literally and metaphorically (Although, there's a certain argument to be made about the latter; he never truly realizes what's happening to him)\n\nI will end this review by saying if you haven't played this game then you probably shouldn't have read this review. Playing this blind is truly the best way to do it and I don't think I could ever do this game justice just by writing a simple text about it. Also it has a top 5 soundtrack in gaming.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1680451854, "timestamp_updated": 1680451854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Wild how it's already been ten years, but when I think about the success that 80s aesthetics and synthwave music have been making in the mainstream throughout this past decade it kinda checks out. It's crazy to think how a modest indie project like this managed to be some sort of early-2010s missing link that singlehandedly bridged together stuff like Vice City and Manhunt along with Drive and Perturbator, and how almost everything retro-influenced that came after feels like a development of that formula in some degree.\n\nI still remember how Hotline's fragmented, brain damage-flavored storytelling was a big deal at the time, with all the fan theories, the stylistic comparisons to the likes of David Lynch and Suda51, the collective reflections over the whole \"hurting other people\" metacommentary and even the low-key hilarious discussions between people trying to agree on what to call each of the main characters (I mean, how crazy is this). It's not even something new when it comes to indie games that came before or since, but it's still fun to reminisce how along with the ultraviolence and the pumping music it ultimately became one of the trademarks not only of this series but even early-2010s gaming in a broader, even meta sense.\n\nCan't say for sure, but I must have finished this one like half a dozen times at this point; which isn't even that much for such a short game, but still worth it every time. The last two runs are from this last year alone, so I can say for myself that the gameplay still holds up pretty decently for what it is. I mean, it wasn't exactly a go-to example of indie polish back then and obviously even less so these days, but you can still have plenty of head-busting fun not only if you just want to breeze through the story and be done with it, but also if you decide to go for those big scores like I did after a while. Either way you won't regret it.\n\nIf you still haven't given this game a shot, know that there's still plenty of time; both the uniqueness of the presentation and the arcade fundamentals of the gameplay are pretty much timeless on their own at this point. Can't say it's exactly for everyone, or that it doesn't have its fair share of rough edges, but if there's one thing I can say about Hotline Miami's gameplay and personal mythology is that it's A LOT to unpack once you bring yourself to it; if that's a good thing or a bad thing, remains to be seen by you.", "timestamp_created": 1667251136, "timestamp_updated": 1667303254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124587770": {"recommendationid": "124587770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400397997", "num_games_owned": 751, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 521, "last_played": 1656427318}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not understand this whole complaint.

The story evolves beyond that, but it still seems like a mess and doesn't make you feel any better about what you're doing. And if you don't find all the secrets, you won't get the \"true\" ending. Instead you'll get an ending where two completely bogus sounding characters spout dialog that only makes you want to shoot them. The story pieces you along with atmosphere, but I didn't get a good sense of what the writer was trying to tell. Maybe that's not the point.\n\nFor people just looking for a very good action gameplay experience, this is the game. It's gritty, fast, doesn't hold your hand and doesn't forgive. There is no quicksave in between levels, and when you get shot, you go down. Same with the enemies. I can't tell you how much of a blessing that is. So many games these days give everything a ton of hitpoints, which I think breaks the immersion and flow of the game.\n\nAs unforgiving as it is, this game doesn't punish you for failing (like all those NES games did back in the day). The levels are floors in buildings, and once you clear a floor, you can go onto the next level with a fresh checkpoint at the start of that. When you die, just hit R and you IMMEDIATELY respawn at the start of that floor. This makes it so you can't do save/load cheating, but you don't really want to either. It promotes using different strategies and experimenting with weapons, timing, etc.\n\nThis is a fantastic GAME, even if I wasn't as fond of the story. When I want story, I'll watch a movie.\n\nAlso, the music is perfect.", "timestamp_created": 1674795923, "timestamp_updated": 1674795923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522996068000793457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136105909": {"recommendationid": "136105909", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217069449", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1680725205}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game for all family", "timestamp_created": 1680634267, "timestamp_updated": 1680634267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136092018": {"recommendationid": "136092018", "author": {"steamid": "76561199483478720", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1690871572}, "language": "english", "review": "chicken man", "timestamp_created": 1680618362, "timestamp_updated": 1680618362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126641979": {"recommendationid": "126641979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121427136", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1690958113}, "language": "english", "review": "Florida simulator", "timestamp_created": 1669306981, "timestamp_updated": 1669306981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130740251": {"recommendationid": "130740251", "author": {"steamid": "76561199217076638", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1673584780}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun run and gun game.

The achievements, should you dedicate your time to completing them along your countless playthrough of infinite replay value, should be easy to get once you figure the ins and outs of what you are supposed to do, and with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe story begins in the late 80s, as you are in the shoes of the chicken mask person, Jacket, who answers various phone calls from an unknown source, that are giving you various tasks to do in certain locations. However, the various tasks you do are not as they seem. During the story, you are up against dozens of white suits who are all out for you and will take every inch to stop you with a smash or a gun blast. And your goal may be to eradicate all of them, but on the other side, you're killing the enemy suits as violently as possible. And the setting where the calls instruct you to go is always indoors.\n\nIn the game mechanics side of things, you will always be rewarded weaponry for furthering your score on each level you play, but the masks that you find throughout the levels provide different perks that you can experiment with. One can give you accuracy, grant you fist kills, or even make you go faster than your normal speed. Combos that you accrue from consecutive kills will reward you perfectly, and it will be counted for in the post-level statistics that will give you a rank based on your play style and what tactics and tricks you have used.\n\nThe music is top notch stuff from various artists, e.g. El Huervo (who had gone on to make art work for the sequel), M|O|O|N, Scattle, and Perturbator. The electronic synthwave styles invoke the right feeling that Hotline Miami has gone for, as well as the songs being the favorites of many HLM fans who could have them on repeat, or a fancy little playlist they can listen to on a few moments of chill time. Even I appreciate the soundtrack at its core, because the artists have made an excellent work capturing the feel of the game in their entirety. In case I'd want to share my toast of gameplay and I'd want to minimize copyright, I'd replace that marked material with stuff along the lines of artists like Immorpher and Aleks with a K, but have a remix of Miami by Razer, making the statistics sound like it's supposed to.\n\nAll in all, I'm daring to recommend Hotline Miami to anyone who is seeking violent adrenaline combat that is majorly expected from this top down arcade shooter. It will give you a test of a fighting time-bomb against all odds, but it'll cause a pain of trial and error on a few instances if you are not careful enough. Experiment with different tactics, play out your combos, and you will be well rewarded.", "timestamp_created": 1695217316, "timestamp_updated": 1695217316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146466658": {"recommendationid": "146466658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983077679", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 836, "last_played": 1694977853}, "language": "english", "review": "I made A+ on all levels just because I like music.

Well it's primarily gorey pixel art from a top-down perspective with the added layer of trippy flashing colors, blinking lights, shakey camera, moving text... yeah, in general, the game gives a rather strong impression in that regard, and definitely isn't intended for those with epilepsy.\n\nSound design, you mostly get basic sound effects like gunshots, melee hits etc. The interesting part is the music, which is a hit-or-miss for me. Some of the electronic renditions are headbang-worthy (my favorites are Perturbator, Inner Animal, Knock and Turf Main), but some others just make me wish it would stop. Generally the more, well, trippy scenes have the less bearable music, which kinda fits I guess.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect: get in and make sure everything dies. Every kill is bloody and, well, satisfying, if you have a tendency for being a psychopath. The game in general is a lot more technical than you'd think - while your enemies aren't very bright and will charge or shoot you the moment they see you and generally die to a single weapon hit or shot, the same applies to you, meaning cover and careful movement are your friends. There is a pretty large selection of weapons, melee and ranged alike, with each one behaving a little differently. You can charge in guns blazing and survive, but only if you're good enough to do it. The game also heavily encourages it with its combo system for kills, but that's only if you care about getting high scores (and unlocking some extra stuff). If you die, you can restart the entire floor instantly by pressing a single button, and you also get infinite lives, so it's fair in that regard. The game itself tends to be rather well balanced and not amazingly difficult, but fairly challenging at times, except for a few specific floors that can be a bit of a difficulty spike.\n\nThe story does not appear to be very clear at the start, with maybe some extra newspaper scraps you can find around the main character's house each day giving some background as to what the hit was about clearly. The normal ending also does not explain much either. [spoiler]However if you find all the puzzle pieces scattered across the levels and make a password out of it, you can see the true ending where you find out what is the actual purpose behind the mysterious phone calls.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good, if a little bit... sensory-overloading experience. The gameplay is fun but gets a little bit repetitive if you play for longer than an hour at a time, and the conclusion is actually a little deeper than you'd think.

No other game evokes the same sense of crazed desperateness as you pummel some poor Russian mobsters face into the dance floor, only to get up a split second later, grab his shotgun, and blow away the other Russian Mobsters who've been unfortunate to be in the same building as you.\n\nWhile the action is split second and fast-paced, the game rewards tactical planning and thinking more than twitch reactions. You will not succeed trying to run through a building swinging a baseball bat like a madman. You're going to have to bait enemies, burst into a room when no one's looking, and die several times perfecting ways to murder people.\n\nMy only complaint is how vague the boss fights are.

Artistically, the 16 bits style is not beautiful but it fits perfectly the overall atmosphere and the environment will be covered in blood most of the time. The plot is mysterious and offers a lot of questions but is averagely good enough to keep you interested. But what is really special about Hotline Miami is its soundtrack, it's absolute perfection.

The first kill was shocking, fast, and pointless. I felt sick and angry at the person who\u2019d forced me into it. Then they gave me a pipe, and then a gun, and I kept killing. For as disturbing as the mutilated corpses and pools of blood around me were, the feedback I was being given was intoxicating, and the thrill of barely avoiding death only heightening the sensation.\n\nHotline Miami doesn\u2019t revel in violence, but it never attempts to shy away or filter it. It knows it\u2019s depraved, but also that there\u2019s some twisted part inside of us that enjoys, even craves violence. It fills our entertainment and history, but rarely asks us to recognize the horror of hurting someone. There\u2019s always a justification, a clear line drawn between the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d people or those who \u201cdeserve it\u201d. It\u2019s what allows us to explore violence in media without becoming psychotic or repulsed, but it also seems to grant a lot of leeway for what is considered acceptable, a gap that only widens the more we consume and the less it registers.\n\nI\u2019ve played a lot of violent games, many far more graphic and realistically rendered than Hotline Miami, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever played one that made me more disturbed of myself. Hotline Miami does this not by any narrative reason or even because it\u2019s violence is so grotesque, but because of how fun it makes killing someone, and how it constantly pushes you to do it better, faster, more interestingly. It\u2019s mechanics are tight and focused, reworking its top-down shooter framework into some more puzzle-like and melee focused. It rewards you for every action but always dangles the carrot slightly beyond your reach, challenging do it again, this time with style.\n\nThe more I played, the better I became at thinking like the sociopathic machine my character had become. I forgot about people I was killing or the reason I was doing so (if there ever was one); they were just pieces in an elaborate, deadly puzzle which I needed to clear as efficiently as possible.\n\nIt\u2019s the tiny things that make Hotline Miami so mesmerizing. The way points explode after every kill, or that the music never stops when you die, leaving you no chance to back out. Everything is so tightly knit and ferociously intense, you aren\u2019t afforded the space to think before acting. You just move and let your instincts take over.\n\nBut all of this wouldn\u2019t mean anything if the game was nothing but violent, strategic rooms for you to exploit. It\u2019s the moments that come later that remind you that you\u2019re human and exist in a world not of exploding meat bags, but living people, that make Hotline Miami\u2019s violence mean something. Picking up a pizza or talking to the video store clerk, there\u2019s the haunting feeling of desperately trying to pretend you\u2019re still sane; that you have some connection to the world you seem only capable of destroying. When you\u2019re finally pushed out of the world, it\u2019s disorienting and frightening, and left me with only more people to kill as every remaining aspect of my sanity evaporated.\n\nIf Hotline Miami has any major faults, it\u2019s that it\u2019s often as fragile as its protagonist, and by the end has similarly fallen to pieces. Enemy AI is barely present, somewhat intentionally to give you time to react but usually because it\u2019s broken or suddenly hyper aware of your position. Hit detection is wonky and unpredictable, and the game crashed more than a few times before I was through. It level designs are also exceedingly front-loaded, with many of the later missions stripping you of any freedom and pitting you against tedious death loops. A handful of truly horrendous scripted sequences also caused me more deaths than the entire rest of the game combined, and ruined the excellent pacing up to that point.\n\nPart of me thinks those flaws are almost worth having though, as they were a reminder that at the end of the day Hotline Miami is still a game. With how overwhelming its audio and visuals are, I often became intensely absorbed in what I was doing, so being broken out of it by a bad level or glitch was almost welcomed. Because Hotline Miami is dark, twisted, perverse, and I had an astounding amount of fun with it, which is what really scares me.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/03/13/hotline-miami-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1426208008, "timestamp_updated": 1426208008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 328, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.910023868083953857", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16220580": {"recommendationid": "16220580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035346694", "num_games_owned": 1395, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1375625204}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]HOTLINE MIAMI - Fun, Fast, Challenging & Compelling[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]The 16-Bit style retro graphics are detailed and stylish, really adding to the overall atmosphere of the game.

Although the music is looped it isn't repetitive and I found, even after dying for the tenth time in a row, it still felt fresh and exciting helping to throw you back into the fight.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]Hotline Miami is full of fast packed action, even best laid plans go astray in a moment forcing you to improvise, think on your feet and when all else fails rely on quick button pressing. As the levels progress the game becomes more challenging, but by this point your hooked and need to see the story through to the bitter end.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]Dark & suspenseful, the story is surprising deep and engaging (for what on the surface appears to be a fairly simple game). Sometimes the game will leave you wondering exactly what is happening to you, sometimes small details will change between levels (who's that person in my apartment? who is ringing my phone?...) but they all help to weave the story of the characters descent into a world of crime, murder and madness[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]6[/td]\n    [td]There isn't much to say here, the story is linear so it mostly depends on how much you enjoyed playing the first time round. There are lots of masks to collect which give you certain bonuses that might appeal to completionists.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]A true gaming classic, retro 80's, ultra-violent, stylish, solid challenging game play with awesome music and a great story. lots of fun to play, highly recommended.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended]More reviews by Fancy Fish[/url]\n[i]Agree / Disagree?

It has a sweet retro 80s feeling to it, kickass fast paced gameplay, and awesome soundtrack. Altough it has some frustrating levels, when you execute a high combo, you cant help but feel awesome.\n\n+Sweet Artwork\n+Satisfying Gameplay\n+Amazing soundtrack\n+It has Charm\n+Great Atmosphere\n+Great Ending (in my opinion)\n\n-Short\n-Frustrating at times\n\nHotline Miami is a game that makes you feel like a badass. Even tough you might not be into theese type of games, you'll still enjoy this game. It can go as low as 2\u20ac on sale, so if you are still doubting to get this must have, get it cheap on the sale!\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1389109352, "timestamp_updated": 1389109352,

play a fast paced, top-down shooter with a great pixelated aesthetic, over the top gore, and an amazing soundtrack that will have you banging your head to the beat while shooting up bad guys? If that at all sounded appealing to you, get this game, because that is what this games sets out to do, and it achieves that perfectly. I know I used a bunch of words in that description (great, amazing, and perfect) that are all overused in reviews so much that they have all basically lost all meaning, but I couldn\u2019t think of any other way to describe how impressed I am with with this game.\n \n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n[b]Story[/b] I\u2019m not going to say [strike]much[/strike] anything about it so I don\u2019t spoil it, but I loved the story. A game like this doesn\u2019t really even need a good story, just something to bring you from level to level, but this game went above and beyond.\n \n[b]Feel[/b] I was going to put Art Style and Music in two separate categories, but couldn\u2019t because of how well they complement each other to make both much better. The art style and music are the definition of \u201cThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts\u201d They work so well together to create an amazing feel to the game that works so well with the gameplay and the story (which also work together to be greater than the sum of their parts)\n \n[b]Core Gameplay[/b] Like the rest of this game, it\u2019s amazing. The controls are tight, the game makes you feel powerful, the scoring system is done well, anything you can think of is just good.\n \n[b]High Octane[/b] Do you like high octane games? Well good, because this is a high octane game. Now, I\u2019m not entirely sure what \u201chigh octane\u201d means, but I\u2019ve heard a [i]lot[/i] of games described as high octane, and Hotline Miami is the embodiment of those games.\n \n[b]Fun[/b] This game is really FUN. I had a blast playing it, and you probably will too\n \n \n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n \n[b]Controls[/b] The controls took a little bit to get used to, specifically picking up and throwing weapons, but once I got used to it the problem was basically nonexistent. The only other problem I had with the controls was when selecting things in the menu, you use the arrow keys to change what you\u2019re selecting, and then click with the mouse to choose it. It\u2019s a bit weird and unintuitive, but it's not too bad because it doesn\u2019t really affect the game, just the menu.\n \n[b]Length[/b] It took me about 6 hours to play through the story, and the game is so great I wish it were much longer. Though, it does have masks and weapons to unlock, achievements to play for, and the levels are scored so it\u2019s fun to try to beat your highscore, so it\u2019s not too bad.\n \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1] I originally meant for this review to be like 3 lines, but this game is so amazing, once I started writing and thinking about how good it is, I couldn\u2019t stop writing.

For the Groundhog Day element you\u2019ll be respawning ridiculously fast so a level that may hold a lot of initial surprise with tons of killer enemies that may kick your ass at first will soon become child's play as through your infinite, multiple lives you\u2019ll soon know exactly where every single enemy is, how they move, and what weapons they have meaning you\u2019ll soon be doing some vicious combos in no time.\n\n[h1]+Soundtrack[/h1]: A mix between soothing A E S T H E T I C music and blood pumping electronic beats that fits the mood when you need to slow down after the high and take in the strange story of Hotline Miami or when you take another drug hit and go on a massacre while the electro music blares in the background making you feel oh so good after bashing several dudes skulls in. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKD-MVfC9Ag&t=1368s\n\n[h1]+Artstyle[/h1]: A lot of trippy visual effects and blood and gore galore making it a fun experience overall. As for gameplay purposes the sprites of enemies are easily identifiable and the weapons are all very visible meaning it shouldn\u2019t be an issue for quick combat reactions.\n\n[h1]-Cons[/h1]\n\n[h1]-/+Length[/h1]: Very short game, I was able to beat the main campaign in about 2 hours. However, tons of replayability as levels will give you a grade based on factors such as time it took to you to beat the level and kill combos meaning there is replay value.\n\n[h1]-Difficulty[/h1]: The game may start out fun and fast at first but later on it spikes in difficulty quite suddenly meaning it can be an annoyance to have the games speed slow down after getting such a blood rush from all the quick kills.\n\n[h1]-Story[/h1]: The story can be a little unclear as a lot of the main characters actions are done after he receives a message on his answering machines as well as there being multiple characters manipulating him. However, the large question still remains which is are they real or are they a result of something else going on in the main character's head?  Regardless, the story will require a bit more looking into to understand.\n\t\n[h1]Final Verdict(8/10)[/h1]: Despite the minor complaints it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the game just being a plain bloody good ole time with lots of drugs and killing.

"review": "What can you say about Hotline Miami that hasn't already been said? It made waves when it came out in 2012, equally horrifying players with its brutal violence and delighting them with its bubbly synthwave soundtrack. It's a game of contradictions, confusion, and finding truth amid a number of neon-soaked bloodbaths. I loved every minute of it.\n\nHotline Miami places you in 1989 Florida, where a man in a varsity jacket is threatened into committing spree killings by mysterious messages left on his answering machine. To hide his identity, he uses masks that seemingly grant him special powers - for example, \"Don Juan\" turns any door into a killing machine, \"Peter\" silences all of the player's gunshots, and \"Rasmus\" makes it easier to identify objects scattered around levels. The narrative here is mostly nameless, as only a handful of characters get proper introductions. This gives the story a very odd, abstract feeling to it. Just who are these people that our protagonist is meeting? Does his friend at the grocery store know more about the killings than he's letting on? Are the masked men who visit him nightmares or something more real? Though the game does provide some answers, the player is forced to draw their own conclusions on several plot points.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to other top-down twin-stick shooters, but with one major difference: you and most enemies die in one hit. Fortunately, restarts are instant and are relegated to your current floor. This gives you plenty of room for experimentation. Are enemies too scattered to make ambushes work? Grab an assault rifle and gun them down from a distance. Need a weapon at the level's opening? Put on the Dennis mask and carve up those immediate enemies with a knife. Your only objective is to kill everyone in a targeted building, and the game gives you numerous ways to do so. You can bash them with melee weapons, shoot them with shotguns or SMGs, or knock them to the floor and beat their heads in. Eurogamer called the game a \"top down fuck em up,\" and I can safely say that is an appropriate title to give it.\n\nHotline Miami's soundtrack is a bouncy throwback to the synth songs of 80s action movies. Artists like MlOlOlN, Jasper Byrne, and Perturbator get their chances to shine in the disturbingly-fitting combat. You may not associate electronic music with mass murder before Hotline Miami, but you definitely will once you finish the game. The entire soundtrack is fantastic (and worth buying along with the game!), but some more variety might have been nice. The first half of the game has the tendency to use the same song at least twice in levels. It isn't a serious issue, but it feels like a missed opportunity to bring more talent on board.\n\nThe replayability is strong. You can compete against yourself or others with the game's scoring system. Rack up higher combos or find ways to score more points, and you just might get an A+ on the level. There are also bonus masks, unlockable weapons, and puzzle pieces that can all be collected if you're a completionist. It can be somewhat difficult to find these items in the 2D landscape, but it isn't impossible to get them all without a guide.\n\nHonestly, Hotline Miami may be one of my favorite games of all time. Minor complaints aside, I can't find much fault with it. It is difficult, but it feels fair in the way its challenges work. Its length is enough without wearing out its welcome. The gameplay is varied, and almost any level can be completed in dozens of different ways. Dennaton Games knocked it out of the park on all fronts. I would highly recommend buying it at full price.

In order to anonymously execute these tasks, he wears animal shaped masks, the first of which he received in a package supposedly containing cookies. Following the phone caller's orders for a while, Jacket's reality eventually begins to fade, as he sees talking corpses and the like. Will he be able to keep acting out the incoming phone calls, or give into insanity as he keeps slaughtering countless people?\n\n[b]<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>[/b]\n\nThe game's idea is very simple: you drive to various places, choose one of the many (unlockable) masks and get ready for a killing spree. How you tackle each mission is entirely up to you: do you want to use a big shotgun and blast 3 people to pieces simultaneously? Or would you rather use a little, yet very sharp knife - killing everyone before they see you as you sneak around? Or do you not care about any of that and just want to use raw power as you punch everyone in the face? It's all possible in this gory, action packed murder simulator!\n\nBy completing missions and acquiring certain scores, you'll unlock more masks which modify your game in various small ways (e.g. start with a knife, more ammo etc). As levels get harder, it is not a bad idea to strategically pick a mask that'll greatly increase your chances of conquering each mission without too much trouble. Or, one could also act out the opposite - picking a mask that'll greatly increase the challenge of an already fairly difficult game.\n\nYes, you did read that correctly: the game is difficult. But luckily not unfair. More so, this game is the perfect example that any challenge can be overcome by trial and error. You may fail the first 50 times, but once you figure out that one mission which seemed near impossible, you'll most likely be able to finish it way more quickly and creatively next time.\n\nAs difficult as the game can be, it is just as rewarding (if not more) and fun, due to the many creative ways with which you can slaughter your enemies. It is also guaranteed to pump your body full of adrenaline, as this game is not really a relaxing one (well, that depends. For some, killing countless people may feel relaxing. [strike]You filthy sadist)[/strike].\n\nIf we look at the amount of replayability there is available, don't worry: there's a lot! To start, try getting an A+ score on all chapters. This alone will greatly increase your hours spent, as it gets more and more difficult to get this highest score in the later chapters. This game is also an amazing game for people who like speedrunning, as you get a higher score for completing a chapter more quickly. Lastly, and I said this already, there are so many creative ways in which you can complete a chapter, that you can just keep on playing and still have a very different experience compared to your  first playthrough.\n\n[b]<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>[/b]\n\nAs far as the controls go; they are rather minimalistic and really easy to get used to. Running around is done with your familiar wasd, whereas shooting/picking up/dropping/throwing weapons is done with the mouse. Luckily, there is also a quick-restart button (the r key), which is going to become your best friend throughout this adventure.\n\nAs this is an indie game, ofcourse the art style has to be unique, right? Lots of flashy colouring and effects to suit the crazy atmosphere of the game. Combined with the highly addictive soundtrack, you'll feel like you're on drugs 24/7 (you won't believe how cheap this drug is aswell, let alone on a -75% sale!)\n\nMentioning the soundtrack ... Believe me when I say it is amazing. Especially Hydrogen gets me in that zone where I turn into a ruthless serial killer and laugh my ass off while chopping everyone's faces to pieces. This soundtrack, the art style and fast-paced gameplay go really well together and make for an incredibly fun overall experience.\n\n[b]<<<The verdict>>>[/b]\n\nLook no further: everyone's favourite murder simulator is here! Therefore, recommended to everyone who is not afraid to partake in a journey full of trial and error, many creative ways to kill enemies and engaging in a crazy, over the top storyline!
