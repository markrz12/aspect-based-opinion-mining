I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Factorio and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\"", "timestamp_created": 1671882697, "timestamp_updated": 1671882697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 441, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879667341709136963", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136457057": {"recommendationid": "136457057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140723790", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 14445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "playtime_at_review": 14070, "last_played": 1695906657}, "language": "english", "review": "The factory must grow.

This is a game that\u2019ll take control over your life! It\u2019s by far the most addictive game I\u2019ve played. Factorio seems highly complex when you first look at screenshots or videos of others\u2019 bases, but it\u2019s not difficult to get into.\n\nIt offers an in-game tutorial system with tips about most of the different items, hotkeys, and techniques in the game \u2013 as well as a playable tutorial campaign that\u2019s extremely well-made. The tutorial campaign is 10\u201315 hours of content, and it\u2019s fun and engaging to play, feeling more like a game on its own rather than a tutorial. It\u2019s available for free in the demo, which I recommend playing to see if Factorio is the game for you. Some aspects of the game, such as train mechanics, also offer playable tutorial segments that offer in-depth guidance on that part of the game.\n\nFactorio was inspired by modded Minecraft, particularly the BuildCraft and IndustrialCraft mods. It feels like what a Tekkit modpack for Minecraft would be if it were a game built from the ground-up. The game is extremely polished, with very few bugs and lots of nifty quality-of-life features, as well as a huge modding community offering an endless amount of content, changes, and improvements. However, I recommend playing the game without mods until you\u2019ve reached a point where you feel like you\u2019ve \u2018finished\u2019 your first playthrough, except for a few quality of life mods that you may add at any time (although I still recommend playing the game without mods for a while regardless).\n\nThe graphics are quite nice for this type of 2D, top-down-view game. The performance \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nFactorio offers an enticing gameplay loop where you build machinery and logistics apparatus, upgrade those devices, and optimize your factory. It\u2019s a game all about automation and optimization, where you constantly strive to produce everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. The game offers an enticing research paths with unlocks and bonuses that constantly leaves you excited for what\u2019s next. This is a game that\u2019s hard to put down! While the game is [i]never[/i] on sale, it\u2019s hard to deny that the game is undoubtedly worth the 32 \u20ac/$35. This is one of those games that you\u2019ll get hundreds upon hundreds of hours out of \u2013 if not [i]thousands[/i]!", "timestamp_created": 1686922776, "timestamp_updated": 1686942152, "voted_up":

[b]If you're interested in playing the game and are capable of buying it - do so[/b]. It's a very good \"factory\" game (and somewhat brought this genre to the masses), very customisable and has Steam Workshop support, which is always a big plus.\n\nHowever, I do have to point out the reason this review is negative. I won't go too deep into detail, but it's simply that Wube (developers of this game) promised to not increase the game's price and to not put it up on any sales, basically the Nintendo approach (which is actually not that good, but I digress). However this week they decided to \"adjust the price for inflation since the release in 2016\". \nTo their credit, the increase by 5$ is indeed approximately correct; however they didn't take several things into account. Their game isn't getting any newer, there is an expansion promised that nobody knows the release date of; other than that the game has been pretty much the same since full release in 2020, apart from minor bugfixes. Which begs the question, does Wube think that their game is not only worth the same price, but even more now? If anything, considering their celebration of selling over 3 million copies back in February 2022 - you wouldn't think they'd need even more money. \n3 million copies for 20$ each (average of all regional currencies) is 60 mil before Steam cut, 42 mil after the cut (we're also assuming they didn't get any better percentage than 30% which simply isn't the truth). 42 mil $ for (at the time of 3 mil copies) 7 years, not including any money from Kickstarter and sales before they went on Steam. 6 mil $ per year, assuming they spend around 1 mil $ on any expense besides salaries - that's 5 mil $ per year for a team of 30, or ~14k $ per person per month. According to public sources that's on the lower end of average Software Dev salary (keep in mind Software Dev isn't fully equal to Game Dev).\n\nIt's less so the problem of: \"Oh no, they're increasing the price\". And more a problem of: \"Oh no, they lied to us about not increasing the price and justify it with bullcrap\". There's no legit reason to use the Nintendo scheme, it's dumb at the core and considers digital media to always cost the same, despite obviously lagging in comparative quality over time. Shoutout to Kovarex, one of the Wube devs, who doubled down on these statements and made a fool of himself on Reddit.\n\n[i]Small update for the price increase aftermath:[/i]\nI genuinely can't begin to comprehend how Wube decided to not only ignore the backlash, but also make it worse by completely destroying regional prices. \nThere's a whole discussion to be had about issues with Valve's recent changes to suggested regional pricing and the misinformation that's been spread about it (e.g. \"the pricing is enforced by Valve\").\nWhat is factual, however, is that a lot of \"factory\" and resource management games on Steam have much better regional pricing than Factorio.\n\nSatisfactory (30$), The Planet Crafter (20$), Mindustry (10$), RimWorld (35$), Volcanoids (20$), Dyson Sphere Program (20$), Oxygen Not Included (25$) all have 31-33 regional prices that are below recommended by Valve, with a median of 30-40% price decrease. Factorio has 12 regional prices below recommended by Valve, with a whopping median of 5-6% price decrease (all of the above info publicly available on SteamDB). What the hell, Wube?\nFurthermore, I want to point out that RimWorld, despite having the same $ price, is on sale often, with 2 recent sales being 28$. RimWorld is also special, because it started in 2013 on Kickstarter and released on Steam in Early Access in 2016 just like Factorio. Yes, Rimworld has DLCs, but 2 of the 3 have recently gone on sale, they also cost less than the base game (unlike what Wube promises with their upcoming expansion).\n\nIf you're interested in Factorio, but the price is too steep (especially regional) for you - I recommend looking into Satisfactory, Mindustry and Dyson Sphere Program. If you're more interested in resource management - look into other games I've mentioned (also Dwarf Fortress).\nAll of the games I've mentioned go on sales, obviously have good regional pricing and the very few that increased their price after release - increased it because of added content, not because of inflation.", "timestamp_created": 1674394002, "timestamp_updated": 1675667345, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 202, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789770305156707764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127050014": {"recommendationid": "127050014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051328988", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 33499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 720, "playtime_at_review": 13347, "last_played": 1696439532}, "language": "english", "review": "The factory must grow.", "timestamp_created": 1669477439, "timestamp_updated": 1669477439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789513885974884033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131244758": {"recommendationid": "131244758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057526644", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1132, "playtime_at_review": 16055, "last_played": 1695607290}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately this company has made the decision to increase the price on a 6 year old game in six days.

Big part of it is, that our (or at least mine) approach to money is, that once you have enough to live comfortably, and enough to financially support the ongoing (and future) projects you want to do, you don't really need more. There is no reason to squeeze the extra $ just to get yacht bigger then the next millionare, or to buy the overprised expensive stuff when you buy it just to show off. And this has some deep implications, because once you feel that you have enough, you can safely ignore all these people trying to buy % of your company for big cash.

This game has taken me on an emotional rollercoaster that rivals any real-life rollercoaster, complete with moments of exhilarating joy and heart-wrenching frustration. It's like having a pet tiger\u2014utterly fascinating, yet occasionally ready to rip your face off.\n\nLet's start with the joy. Factorio is a captivating game that hooks you from the moment you crash land on an alien planet. The sheer satisfaction of starting with a few mining drills and eventually building a sprawling factory empire is indescribable. The sense of accomplishment as you optimize your production lines and automate everything in sight is like eating a perfectly cooked steak while your favorite song plays in the background.\n\nBut oh, dear player, beware! Factorio's difficulty is as real as the feeling you get when you step on a LEGO brick barefoot. It lulls you into a false sense of security before slapping you in the face with a smorgasbord of challenges. Your dreams of constructing a flawless, spaghetti-free factory will soon be replaced with a tangled mess of belts, pipes, and tears.\n\nYou see, Factorio has a twisted sense of humor. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, it throws a wrench (or a dozen) into your well-oiled machine. Alien biters will invade your precious factory, sending you into a panic reminiscent of a cat chasing a laser pointer. And don't even get me started on the power struggles\u2014trying to balance your energy grid is like juggling flaming chainsaws while riding a unicycle on a tightrope.\n\nThe frustration is real, my friend. It's the kind of frustration that makes you question your life choices and contemplate adopting a simpler existence as a hermit in the woods. But just when you're about to rage-quit and sell your soul to the nearest pawnshop, you'll have a breakthrough. A solution will materialize in your tired brain, and suddenly, your factory will hum with efficiency once again. It's a sweet victory that makes all the hair-pulling moments worthwhile.\n\nFactorio is a game that delights in both your success and your suffering. It will simultaneously make you feel like a genius and an imbecile. But through it all, you'll be captivated by its addictive gameplay and the promise of creating the ultimate automated utopia. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll probably swear like a drunken pirate.\n\nSo, my fellow brave factory builders, I wholeheartedly recommend Factorio. Embrace the joy, embrace the pain, and remember that deep down, it's all part of the beautifully chaotic journey that is this game. Happy engineering, and may your factories be forever spaghetti-free!\n\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606", "timestamp_created": 1684708365, "timestamp_updated": 1684708365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753731608390808105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131277837": {"recommendationid": "131277837", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988778640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1060, "last_played": 1601081628}, "language": "english", "review": "Games great, but I've had to adjust my views to match inflation.

It's simply awesome to this day.\nAchievements are overall dependent on having an efficient factory but can be \"cheesed\" by making a flat map with no polution and semi-peacefull biters (the options that disable achievements are clearly labeled)\n\nThe internet is full of guides and videos. And you can even import and auto-build entrie bases... they can get most of the achievements for you\n\nThe game has an internal achievement tracker and I want to say that's simply really good QOL.\n\n----\n\nLastly i'll note about 2 subjects that came up with this game:\n*  The developers tend to get into politics ... taking sides on social issues. I find it quite annoying to be preached at by my escapism  ~NO MATTER IF I AGREE WITH THEM OR NOT~ .\n*  The price is fixed and doesn't ever go on sale ( from 5E to 40E depends on where you live on the globe but averages to 30Euro/$). And while I agree with the devs that sales usually ensure you buy games that are never played due to FOMO I must say that the game (in my opinion) might not be \"worth all the money\". And that's something that sales do help with... for some players this games is worth 60$ and for some it may be worth 15$... and with this I feel that choice is now removed from the player.\n\nEdit: 400~ hours in ..game's still fun.

It is pretty straightforward if you know what to look for otherwise it can be frustrating. The game just gives you tools and expects you to figure it out yourself. Which is great if you are familiar with this genre. But seeing as I'm a lowly scrub super out of touch with games like this... yeah. Frustrations abound! Lots of moving parts and calculations and keeping track of it and holding solid in that mindset is the essence of this game and considering I excel at that type of thing in other areas of gaming and life you'd think I'd've taken to this like a fish in a rocket but alas! It's presented in a different way than I'm used to and rewiring my thinking it's kinda part of the fun. :)\n\nSo a big thanks the friend shape for telling me to keep this.

Those being [b]Factorio, Dyson Sphere Program, and Satisfactory[/b]. I have them listed in the order I'm reviewing them, as well as the order of their quality to me.\n\n I think this review should serve to illustrate the quality of Factorio, and what makes it special when compared even to the factory games that have now released in it's wake. There is no question that Factorio is a masterpiece, but what sets it atop the tower? Why do I think that other automation games are struggling to live up to Factorios legacy? I hope that is something I can answer.\n\n[h1] Performance [/h1]\n\n The common theme that you will quickly pick up on in this review is that Factorio continues to set the standard for the genre it takes place in, and it's performance is no different. Factorios graphics are not cutting edge, fully realized 3D environments like Satisfactory, or fully modeled planetary systems like Dyson Sphere, but Factorios pixel art is highly detailed, and beautiful to look at, from both a micro and a macro level. Everything flows so beautifully, in close to 1k hours in this game, I have never had my game drop below 60FPS. My brother who actually has the income to get a 144Hz monitor, speaks to the same level of consistent performance even at that elevated framerate. The game is fully capable of handling thousands of things on the screen, be they enemies, items in your factories, or friendly bots and trains running effortlessly at your chosen framerate.\n\n[b]tl;dr: Factorio's performance is as close to perfect as you can get, with large selection of options to tweak and configure. (I mean they got this running native on the Switch)[/b]\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\n Factorio is a top down game, and the gameplay consists of resource gathering > resource automation > resource refining > logistics > enemies/expansion > back to step one. Every element of Factorio's design is so immaculately crafted, and balanced from years of early access development, and careful attention to feedback from the community. It feels that you always have a goal, you always have something you could do, something you need to do, or some system you could be doing better or all together not even engaging with. Every system added to the gameplay loop feels so intentional, and so deliberate to push you forward. Your goal is to get a satellite into space, which requires the refinement of materials, the problem is that the locals don't particularly care for the pollution your machines produce, and as the pollution reaches them, they will attack you. They will also begin to mutate, and become stronger, so enemy progression is intrinsically tied to your progression as well. Factorio also includes an insanely comprehensive and easy to use blueprint system, that allows you to effortlessly copy the design of something and paste it somewhere else, even in different saves, later in the game with construction bots you can even have these blueprints completely built for you automatically. You can also save these blueprints and share them with the community, or use some that the community have put together. It is a wonderful system that the other factory games are still catching up with, and is just another perfectly designed element to continuously push you towards progression.\n\n Factorio is as much about logistics as it is about automation, and once again Factorio sets the gold standard in its genre in this category as well. You have belts for short-medium range transport, trains for long distance hauls, logistic robots that can fulfill requests and keep you and your base supplied, and even a Turing-complete logic system if you want to get into the computational aspects of your base. All of these elements are masterfully crafted, and feel so well designed, so well thought out. These are not just systems that were tacked on, but fully realized and in depth mechanics that you can chose to engage or not engage with at your leisure.\n\n Factorio is completely customizable as well! Don't want enemies? turn them off. Do you want enemies but don't want them to expand at all? disable it. Want resources to be close to infinite and huge? do it. The game has mod support built directly into it, no steam workshop required. You download all mods straight through your main menu, and the game is good to go. The community has created some amazing mods that include entire additional mechanics, total overhauls, sprite reworks etc. \n\n\n[b]tl;dr: Factorio's gameplay once again sets the standard for gameplay, with clever and fully realized systems including full logistics, psuedo tower defense gameplay, built in mod support, generous blueprint system, multiplayer and a Turing-complete logic system that masterfully always pushes you towards your next goal[/b]\n\n[h1] Overall tl;dr: [/h1]\n\n[b] Factorio is one of the best games I have ever played, and its hard to put into words how much i recommend this game, and I do not think that is a failure of my writing ability, but rather a testimate to how masterfully this game is designed. From its insanely impressive and consistent performance, to its incredible depth and variety in its systems, Factorio (and its eventual expansions) is something i cannot recommend enough. Sure it is not for everyone, if you didn't like playing modded minecraft when you were younger, you probably won't enjoy this, and thats okay; but if you found even the slightest bit of fun in that gameplay loop, you will find something to love in this game[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1667511910, "timestamp_updated": 1667512023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658343851566314697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137737260": {"recommendationid": "137737260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418549470", "num_games_owned": 1132, "num_reviews": 642, "playtime_forever": 1957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1957, "last_played": 1682990432}, "language": "english", "review": "This is quite an amazing game, though I am still in the early part of the game, even after 30+ hours.

I believe that demo even provides the multi-player functionality. And while it only shows the early game technologies, there's a whole lot of game that can be done with just the first two science levels.\n\nAnd my second point is that the price includes access to all the community mods and all the developer updates. I bought it on the developer's website, so I could get access to their forum. Maybe purchasing from Steam provides that too, but it's something to consider. Anyway, the thirty-five dollar purchase will give you a lifetime of automation gaming, if that's your thing. It is an gameplay experience that you can share with your friends, too.\n\nWorks great with my gnu-linux desktop and my spouse's window laptop.

Literally, it does not ever go on sale. The justification for this given by the developer is that the game is just so well-loved that it doesn't make sense to put it on sale; the sheer amount of goodwill the community has for the game means a sale isn't necessary. I've always thought that this explanation was flimsy, but at least acceptable to ignore, if not actually agree with. But now, after six years of being released and going on three years since the last update, the developers have decided to increase the price of the game to account for inflation. I want to be clear that if this game had released at $35 with the content it has today, I would have defended it as being worth the cost. However, I think that the developers conveniently ignoring the fact that video games generally depreciate in value over time (which would then balance out any price increase due to inflation), as well as the fact that they have never put the game on sale, just strikes me as legitimately greedy. There was no reason for this; they have millions and millions of dollars in sales; the extra $5 does nothing but spite players who haven't played this game but have been desperately hoping they could get it on sale some day. \n\nIt just comes across as silly and greedy, especially when the devs have previously stated that the DLC they plan to release will cost the same as the base game. So will it cost the original $30, or is this a cheap way to raise the price of the DLC as well so they get an extra $5 from every existing player that buys it?\n\nAlso, final note. Increasing price for inflation is just stupid. When games raise their price, it's because they have added content. I literally cannot think of another game that has done this the way Factorio is doing it. AAA games are releasing at $70 now, but they release at that price, they don't raise it mid life cycle, and especially not 3 years after the last major content was added.\n\nThis is a game that I love from a developer that I now cannot recommend buying from.", "timestamp_created": 1674255553, "timestamp_updated": 1674255553, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653669357299804688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136176549": {"recommendationid": "136176549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376478616", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 24028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18337, "last_played": 1688349171}, "language": "english", "review": "Factorio", "timestamp_created": 1680734240, "timestamp_updated": 1680734240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653632819652557373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131637576": {"recommendationid": "131637576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798327187", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6480, "last_played": 1684347529}, "language": "english", "review": "While I do like the game, raising the price from $30.00 to $35.00 because of inflation is stupid and completely contradicts the developers comments saying the game would stay $30.00 indefinitely.

There is quite a bit of up front work for hours but eventually you end up with a factory that runs itself.  The spaceship parts keep flowing and the people in space are really happy with your work.\n\nAfter awhile though, you spend less and less time improving the factory until it basically just runs on its own.  Sure, you might stop in once in 2-3 years to add new things like a walking spider robot to ensure that you keep those space people happy.  But after awhile it gets a little stale and you have to promise those space people you\u2019ll make more stuff to send them, but it will take awhile.\n\nThen one day you realize that an inflation crisis is affecting the world and its a perfect excuse to charge the space people more money for the same product you\u2019ve been giving them for 3 years straight so you can afford a better cappuccino machine on your yacht.  Who cares that the factory runs itself, hasn\u2019t been affected at all by inflation and you haven\u2019t upgraded it in decades.  You are happy to charge people more for the same space slop you are feeding the space people, even though you promised you would never do it.

You'll play your first world and then run into the same wall that has stopped tons of players. And you'll be too deep to get a refund. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1687221798, "timestamp_updated": 1687221798, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601245522499084473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125730505": {"recommendationid": "125730505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076580656", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1671348549}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game.

Factorio's regional price in Argentina increased from 400 ARS to 2500 ARS in a single day, presumibly to deter people in the US (or any other country) using a VPN to buy it cheaper here. It's still way cheaper here, so people will keep doing that, and the people that actually buy it in Argentina still have to pay a (roughly) 75% tax on top of it, so really it's only fucking us over.\n\nNon-TL;DR:\nFactorio is an absolutely great game, I love it.\nSo I'm a bit sad to leave a negative review. It's about regional prices. I live in Argentina, and the recent-ish regional price increases are ridiculous.\nLast year, I bought this game for myself and a friend of mine, at 330 Argentine Pesos for each copy. Later it increased to 400 ARS, which is still fine.\n This year I wanted to buy it for someone else, only to find that the price went up from 440 ARS to 2500 ARS, roughly a 560% price increase. This is absolutely horrid keeping in mind that on top of that, over here we have to pay a huge additional tax on top of that, which ends up leaving the game priced at 4375 ARS.\n\nThese regional prices are meant to stop people using a VPN and buying the game in our currency from overseas, but these changes aren't actually going to stop that. It's still way cheaper for almost anyone to buy it here with a VPN, since they don't have dumb taxes on top of that, so sure, you're slightly deterring those people, but ultimately you're just massively fucking over people in Argentina. I don't expect many people that *actually live here* to buy this game anymore.\n\nMost of the negative reviews based on pricing are complaining about the developers raising the price over time. It's true that it's a questionable practise, but I personally don't view it as that huge of a problem. You could at least argue in favour of it, with the developers actively working on the game and adding/fixing stuff over the years.\nRaising the regional price by over five times overnight, however... That's a problem.\n\nIf you're from Argentina, I guess just pirate the game until our crumbling economy's inflation devalues our monopoly money enough that this game is actually worth buying again.", "timestamp_created": 1688223287, "timestamp_updated": 1688223572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588819205760955811", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134080802": {"recommendationid": "134080802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007485343", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3601, "last_played": 1680925306}, "language": "english", "review": "many hours of enjoyment", "timestamp_created": 1677971763, "timestamp_updated": 1677971763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588159859180450439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131513481": {"recommendationid": "131513481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017603673", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2655, "last_played": 1597420079}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, bad developer.

Well,  I know there's another 3D game around that has same gameplay, but what can I say? I'm not that kid who keeps playing 3D fancy shooting games because for me the gameplay is more important than the graphics. Which in Factorio, explaining the gameplay was complicated and its more easy when people should try it instead.\n\n\u3000It was brilliant gameplay, the factory ran as you wanted. The challenge from the enemy who are attacking you makes you more aware of the pollution caused by your factory was fun.\u00a0You mine, craft, kill natives, and in the end, the world is in your hands, making you forget if the earth is spinning. To be honest, I have no complaints about the gameplay, and it's also the most unique experience I've ever had.\u00a0\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Factorio online was fun, which is really enjoyable when played together. had no issue and didn't notice any lag. better than AAA game that proud of their laggy 1v1 game selled for 6.6 million copy.\n\u3000[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Control[/td]\n        [td]\u3000\n\u3000Played it with a keyboard and mouse.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

The game has managed to sell around 500,000 copies each year since then, which is an incredible achievement for a niche indie game. [b]Wube Software says that this milestone also serves to validate its \"no sales\" policy. Factorio is committed to never running sales on its game, maintaining a constant $30 USD price tag year-round. The developers have stated that this is out of respect for players who have invested in the game. [/b] Sales may help numbers in the short term, the developers have noted, but in the long term, games see lower numbers for months after a sale as customers turn to third-party resellers.\"\n\nThe part in bold is either a lie by the developer or the publisher of this article.

After growing up in a highly dysfunctional environment, I quickly became addicted to a variety of drugs, moving onto other drugs when those old drugs became 'boring', so to say. From 14 years old I was drinking alcohol, smoking weed, and taking Xanax before eventually moving onto harder drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin at around 15 years old. My persistent drug habit caused me to drop out of school at the age of 16, and from that point, I had no skills to find a job and no role model who could guide me along the right path. My drug usage only skyrocketed, and drugs cost money, which caused me to unwisely steal a large amount from my mother and father. They did not deserve such treatment, as they only tried their best, despite their own problems. \n\nI was subsequently evicted, and left on the streets of London to fend for myself. I would wander aimlessly, filing job applications to any place I could, just to afford my drug habit, only to be given a dirty look as if I'm some kind of scum for even trying. Each time I would be told, \"well I guess we'll call you back, what's your number?\", which I understand is a platitude, but I could not even afford a phone to even play into this and give a phone number. I would forage for food in garbage cans and the woods, as I could not even bring up the change to afford a stick of gum.\n\nThen, on one cold night in November, I overdosed on some oxycodone, which ended up containing fentanyl. Thankfully, a friend administered some narcan and saved my life. Eventually, an ambulance showed up and I was ushered into the back of it. In that moment, at now 21 years old, I thought to myself, what the hell is my life? I have wasted so much of my time, youth and potential, so many memories, achievements and experiences I could have had, just chasing drugs. Why? I broke down. I knew things had to change, I knew there was something better than this waiting for me out there.\n\nI went into rehab shortly afterwards. Recovery was long, but there are some amazing people out there, who are quite frankly not paid enough, that patiently and selflessly provided me the support to get better. They helped me quit drugs, discuss my problems in therapy, find a job, find housing, and pursue a better life. I rekindled the relationship that I destroyed with my parents, and found a social circle who supported me. I was just starting to discover just how wrong I was about the world and how great life can be without drugs. \n\nThen I started playing this fucking game.\n10/10 would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1672658404, "timestamp_updated": 1672658404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548557817935943604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131231537": {"recommendationid": "131231537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048068585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1493515152}, "language": "english", "review": "Inflation caused this to go from a meh to a not recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1674250685, "timestamp_updated": 1674250685, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54843062162399292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131673620": {"recommendationid": "131673620", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970587316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1593, "last_played": 1642371200}, "language": "english", "review": "Getting more expensive whenever you look away.

It's a factory building game, the best of all time. \n\nThe thing is, [b]there is literally nothing else but a factory game there.[/b]\n\n[h1]if you are interested in this game, YOU'LL LIKE IT.[/h1] It's that simple. I can't think of a SINGLE flaw in this game. It's addicting, well made, realistic, and truly tests your cognitive abilities. Even the enemy system is just to serve the factory building elements.\n\n[h1]This game has almost endless content.[/h1]\nThere is just SO much to do. It'd take THOUSANDS, AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS to truly be satisfied with JUST THE MAIN GAME. There are SO many ways to design your base, SO many ways to make it more efficient, SO many ways to eliminate your enemies, SO many ways to rethink your process. And this is just in the base game, which leads on to the next point.\n\n[h1]The mods.[/h1]\n\nFactorio, is very, very, very mod friendly. It literally comes with a mod browser in the main menu. And the mods themselves are just SO good. Krastorio 2 is such a good beginner mod pack, that I'd say almost tipples the main games content, which in the end gives 10x the stuff to do if you want to redesign your factories. I beat this mod a few months back. Currently I'm doing a run with my friend of Space Exploration, a mod that takes over 200 hours on average, that literally adds solar system exploring to the game, and adds so much to the point of it feeling like truly infinite possibilities can be achieved.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\nFactorio's multiplayer is probably its weakest element. And that's not due to its balancing or anything. Factorio's multiplayer is VERY good. It's unbelievably easy to connect to your friends, there's literally an option in the multiplayer menu to sort by friends.

If you're seeking a game that will consume your existence and make you forget about your meager existence, then let me introduce you to Factorio. This game is like Cybertronian energy to your circuitry.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nYou begin with a puny factory, thinking you can control it with ease. But before you know it, you're submerged in conveyor belts and nuclear reactors, and you won't even know what day it is. Who cares about the graphics when you're constructing your own empire?\n\n[b]Sound:[/b]\nThe sound effects will excite your audio receptors, and you'll be absorbed in the clanking and humming of machinery. You won't even realize that you've played through the night until your friends, Ramjet, Thrust, and Skywarp, ping you to ask if you're still alive.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nFactorio is a game that will rule your life, and you won't even know it. But, who needs a life when you can become the ruler of your little virtual world? I highly suggest this game to all Decepticons, just don't blame me when you forget to fuel up and recharge for a week straight.

I typically have trouble getting into crafting and survival games, but something about Factorio has really captivated me.  At it's core, the game is very simple - gather some resources, construct belts, inserters, machines etc.  Everything you build in Factorio can be used to construct an elaborate, automated factory to build... more factory.  Ultimately, the main goal is to launch a rocket by researching and building advanced technology.  Looking through the research evolution tree, this seems like such a daunting task at first, but once you get going, your time with this game will fly and before you know it, you're launching that first rocket.  Playing with friends is also a blast, and I've had a lot of fun playing with my son.  There are some optional tower defense elements to this game which can make things a little more interesting by needing to set up walls, turrets and defending your base.  You can also play a more offensive role, by building tanks and the amazing Spidertron and patrolling to clear out the nearby hives that might be smelling your pollution.\n\nI highly recommend this game and it is one of the few that I could play and play and not get bored with.  I'm over 100 hrs in and still have not touched any of the various mods (which I know there are several really cool ones) from the community.

If you aren't careful this game will consume you though.\nThe game starts fairly simple. You crash land on an alien planet with hostile natives. Your goal is to build a rocket to escape, you'll need to build up the infrastructure to do so first though.\n\nThere is always something to do. You'll need to automate production of materials for science. While you're at it why not automate things you use often? Just a slight problem, the game does not tell you the direct ratios for things, and normally things do not split cleanly. You make things perfect, not at first, and that is the best part. By fixing issues and making your life easier through automation you are setting up a whole host of problems that future you will discover, troubleshoot, and fix.\n\nThe factory must grow.\n\nPlaying the game makes more game for you to play in this sense. Time will fly if you aren't careful. You'll be consumed by the \"just one mores.\"\n\nTo add on, the game is reasonably priced, and even a very long time ago in early access this game felt like more of a full game than many modern games.\n\nThe modding scene is rich, there is a mod browser and manager baked right into the game. It is great, there are many complete overhaul mods and qol mods if vanilla eventually gets bland for you.\n\nThere are also tons and tonss of game settings you can tweak before starting to mix things up a bit. Everything from world generation settings to enemy evolution settings. It is great.\n\nThe game runs well, plays well, isn't a buggy mess, and is priced well. Kind of a rare sight.\n\nThe factory must grow.\n\nI'd recommend trying not to spoil much for yourself before you try to play, your first play through will likely be the messiest. You have so much to learn, and that is so much of the fun. Don't get me wrong replayability is great, but nothing is quite like your first time learning the systems and creating speget.\n\nDon't be afraid to use the in game tutorials if you get stuck though! They do a great job. They are always available in the top right of your screen, even mid game.

It will drag you into such a rabbit hole that you'll start to question yourself if it's better to go deeper or to finally climb out. Only then will you realise that hours have gone by as you've expanded your starter base into a location of operation which outputs many products to construct bigger projects.\n\nFrom mining, power management, inventory management, alien invasions, refining resources, discovering new technologies, weapons, environmental changes, pollution, transportation and finally rockets.\n\nThe game starts off with simply mining for scraps of iron and before you know it, you've started creating computer circuits which are needed to be used by other components to be combined into something bigger. You repeat this process until you have your desired outcome and then proceed to research the next technology in the tree.\n\nThis is the main driving force of Factorio, unlocking new things to mess around with in order to progress and try to create a sustainable and efficient factory in order to launch a rocket to space whilst trying to reduce pollution caused by your machines in order to fend off local invading aliens that try to shut down your operations.\n\nA solo experience is a charm but a co-op experience is a treat. Being able to divide tasks between friends really increases your productivity and makes the game that much more enjoyable.

Hours fly by, you wonder why you're thirsty, and it's because you haven't taken a sip of your drink in a couple of hours. \n\nEach build, you learn something new, and at 470ish hours, I'm *STILL* learning.\n\nExtremely satisfying. If I had the money, I'd pay the developers to take a crack at Dwarf Fortress. \n\nMy only complaint is that it's almost too easy to win (it's really not, but after a few play throughs, you'll get what I mean) \n\nIf it's not in your library, yet, I'd sincerely recommend remedying that. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the finest games of this century in terms of polish, addictiveness and replayability. \n\nLove this game 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1665875239, "timestamp_updated": 1665875239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537360012531280518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136970233": {"recommendationid": "136970233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361286758", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 161, "playtime_forever": 2721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 2440, "last_played": 1696290581}, "language": "english", "review": "not unsimilar to drugs, it looks fun but then you get really into it and by the time you're done, a couple hours have passed.\nstarts simple, gets complicated, you are silently made fun of for making a bad base. start over, or do some reconstructing.\nthere are enemies but you can turn them off. they get more powerful with more smog you create.\nalmost endlessly deep, with cool mechanics like trains and drones, there's a lot to do (and research) and if that's not enough for you, there's a huge modding scene with little QoL mods to entire game overhauls. game is multiplayer too and has different modes if the main game isnt your thing.", "timestamp_created": 1681930333, "timestamp_updated": 1681930333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537275075912475586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131218375": {"recommendationid": "131218375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049138542", "num_games_owned": 733, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "playtime_at_review": 9208, "last_played": 1696543284}, "language": "english", "review": "Greedy. https://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162", "timestamp_created": 1674235328, "timestamp_updated": 1674235328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53719717264175415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147133690": {"recommendationid": "147133690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004583352", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 922, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1696037987}, "language": "english", "review": "5 head game", "timestamp_created": 1695827413, "timestamp_updated": 1695827413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536817073822021484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129534413": {"recommendationid": "129534413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042170197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 54379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49312, "last_played": 1686401382}, "language": "english", "review": "how do I automate playing other games?\nmy backlog keeps growing and I can't quit factorio.", "timestamp_created": 1672249644, "timestamp_updated": 1674404634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53680729866027832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131225943": {"recommendationid": "131225943", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994007439", "num_games_owned": 1392, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1674185130}, "language": "english", "review": "Raising the price of a digital game due to inflation?", "timestamp_created": 1674243747, "timestamp_updated": 1674243747, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536552488803863525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131234300": {"recommendationid": "131234300", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999737062", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4268, "last_played": 1645668045}, "language": "english", "review": "Inflation does not effect the price of a 7 year old game.

The following comment is a copy-and-paste from multiple reviews on Steam. These individuals use this tactic to manipulate you into giving them Steam points, using appeals to your compassion, but in reality, it is all lies and deceit.\n\n\"I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I looked to the small crater in the middle of my living room and chortled as I realized that I was a mechanical genius and my only limitation was the weight of non-virtual resources holding me back. \n\nI felt my fingers fly across the keys; I even saw my neighbor grow scared as I pressed W, S, A, and then D while making direct eye contact. It's been 17 years of continual play (ignore what Steam says, they're trying to hold me back). I missed the funeral, the rapture, and even the second coming of the McRib, but did I build several more boxes that make the import lot of a certain large chain grocery store, that I got banned from, look like an unzipped beanbag chair? \n\nYou bet your sweet bippy I did.\n\nPlay the game. It really makes you escape the burden of your sins and even gives your room a nice formaldehyde-esque scent.  \n\nI wasn't paid to write this review, but I did spend precious time I'll never get back to make sure you all know just how cash money it is.", "timestamp_created": 1672458603, "timestamp_updated": 1672458603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129721945": {"recommendationid": "129721945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288092075", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2701, "last_played": 1674928024}, "language": "english", "review": "facory", "timestamp_created": 1672434511, "timestamp_updated": 1672434511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129283665": {"recommendationid": "129283665", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194431727", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1671088502}, "language": "english", "review": "good game overall, but too many bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1672005326, "timestamp_updated": 1672005326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129192170": {"recommendationid": "129192170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032154314", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1673112439}, "language": "english", "review": "my brain hurts", "timestamp_created": 1671907077, "timestamp_updated": 1671907077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128903928": {"recommendationid": "128903928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025003213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 48471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "playtime_at_review": 24883, "last_played": 1696106558}, "language": "english", "review": "man...", "timestamp_created": 1671534520, "timestamp_updated": 1671534520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128901889": {"recommendationid": "128901889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028206615", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12458, "last_played": 1689408666}, "language": "english", "review": "Expand.", "timestamp_created": 1671530956, "timestamp_updated": 1671530956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128249294": {"recommendationid": "128249294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830798251", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4477, "last_played": 1691806355}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Addictive. \nIn the first Week of owning it I spend more time playing it than sleeping or working.\n100% worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1670621609, "timestamp_updated": 1670621631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126287978": {"recommendationid": "126287978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040372428", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 14144, "last_played": 1696479365}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 -

The more you play and organize your base, the more time will become an illusion, and the need for nutrition is put on second place in your brain.

checklist, in a spider like robot, which shoots about 10 nukes per second and walks faster then my fat uncle when my grandmother makes her famous lasagna, extinguishing approximately 500 non human

Surely it must be because the devs are greedy and wanna milk as much as they can from the game without having to release a new one, right?\n\nwell... no. not at all, actually. since the game was released, 'bout a decade ago, the devs have a blog in which, weekly, without missing a single week, they post about upcoming stuff for the game.  in comparison you have AAA publishers that release an unfinished game, just to abandon it during the first year of release and work on the next title, all the while charging you 100 bucks for the base game and some extra, sometimes twice the price of the base game in DLCs. \n\nFactorio ain't like that. You pay the price, you get the game, like it used to be. No microtransactions, no live service, no currency paid in real cash. nothing. The price you pay for the game gives you the full game, access to any and all updates to the game AND mod support, which i'll talk about in depth further below. \n\n[h1]THE GAME(sorry)[/h1]\n\nFactorio isn't exactly a game for [i]everyone[/i]. It scratches a [i]very[/i] specific itch, but it does that better than any other scratcher. To one person, it could be just another boring managerial sim, while to others, it's literal crack. \n\nThe premise is simple: you crashed on alien planet and must rebuild ship to get out of planet. Other games have similar premises, like subnautica or... well i can only remember of subnautica right now. Anyway, this recipe has been tested and tried over and over, so what's special about Factorio?\n\n[strike]conveyor belts[/strike] simplicity.\n\nIf you have looked at screenshots or videos of the game, or even played before, \"simplicity\" probably isn't a word that you'd find fitting for the game, but think about how simple the game is. You only have one goal: to rebuild the rocket ship. There are no side quests, no hidden stashes marked on your minimap, nothing to distract you from your main goal. The side quests and additional content end up being the steps you have to take to rebuild the rocket. you're gonna need lots of circuit boards to build a rocket. for those you'll need plastic. do you have plastic? no you don't. you don't have oil either. you need oil to make plastic. So now your main quest, that is, build the rocket, has been superseded by your side quest: find oil. And that's how the entirety of the game goes, pulling you in the most natural way possible from one objective to the next. You can beat the game with the most Giovanni's Pasta factory you can build, or with the most optimized buses that make your factory look like a motherboard. Or something in between. It lets you do as you please and shows you in real time how effective your buildings are, and that eventually will make you wonder \"Can't i make that any faster?\" In a certain aspect, the game feels almost roguelike. You build your base, realize that it is now terrible and inefficient, raze it to the ground, rebuild it with new knowledge you have from the game, and eventually repeat the whole process, over and over.\n\nOne friendly reminder, though: try to get used to the keyboard shortcuts asap. it cuts down on the time you need to do things IMMENSELY. Doing everything by clicking and manually laboring will quickly make the game feel like a chore.\n\nOh, and i almost forgot: [b]MODS![/b]\n\nFactorio is more akin to a sandbox engine than to an actual game. Think of it like warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne map editor, but with a few maps already done for you. You can turn factorio into a racing game. a TRAIN racing game. A zombie survival/crafting monstrosity? Very possible with mods. A tower defense game? Hell, it even comes with one standard! You like RTS and wish starcraft had more building flexibility? boy, you're not gonna believe this. You can also get more mundane stuff, like... i don't know, more powerful furnaces or whatever. With enough effort you could probably pull out a MOBA. The possibilities are nearly infinite.\n\n[h1]THE VALUE[/h1]\n\nSo, after considering all that, is it worth it? \n\nI'd say try demoing the game for a few hours and see if it's your jam. Having a friend who already knows the game to explain stuff to you helps a lot. If you like the genre then it's a no brainer, get it! At the time of this review, the game has costed me about 0.3 USD/hour of entertainment, which i consider rather cheap. Considering you'll likely never play it for less than 4 hours at a time, the value gets optimal very quickly.\n\nIt should be obvious by now, judging by how many hours of playtime the average factorio player has, but the replayability is probably the best ever made. The objective is always the same, the resources are always the same, but you, the engineer, after every rebuilt factory, after every playthrough, you learn more and improve on your builds. There's always a better, or at least, different way to do what you're already doing, and you don't know how that different way will affect the outcome. So you try it.\n\nFor the quality of gameplay, fair business practices and constant updates since release, this is one of the best games on steam, which is reflected by the reviews.

say?\nthe base game itself is great, being simple once you get the hang of it, un-optimized gameplay works, however as in many games the fun comes in finding just how well you can do it, and how well the game is optimized leaves plenty of room for that. however, the extensive modding support (built straight into the main menu) and community allow changes to the game, ranging from quality of life improvements, to complete overhauls of gameplay, to renai transportation. \n\nThe sound design complements the visuals and overall aesthetic very well, That of a lonely grungy world being terraformed into your personal shrine to industy. you will often find yourself thinking you heard an inserter whirring, or seeing belts in empty space.\n\nWube software, the developers for this title, are one of the devs i hold in higher respects, they embrace the community, as is rare in larger studios. they gifted us with native linux support, for the 3 other people using linux, and you can download the game DRM free off their website\n\nAll in all, if this game looks at all appealing to you, i would recommend first reading a better review, and second, try the game out, if you don't like it, steam will refund it as long as you play for less than 2 hours, alternatively there is a demo available\n\ni rate it five air conditioners out of seven pineapples.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1687033089,

This is the kind of game that is entrancing, where you can sit down to play at 6 PM, look at the clock what you think is 2 hours later, and find it's 2 AM. And at times it feels like it is forcing that playstyle on you, because of just how hard it can be to figure out what you were doing when you come back for another session after a break of any significant length.\n\nAll in all, my suggestion is to play vanilla for something like 100 hours and then [i]never install an overhaul mod[/i].

(iron deficiency)\n\ntheres 3 types of generating power: solar panels and accumulators, steam engines and boilers, nuclear power and steam turbines later in the game, although i wish nuclear reactors were complicated and not just make 4 and place them, get the uranium ore in the centrifuge and connect the output with conveyors close to the reactors, put some inserters to grab the uranium fuel cells and insert it in the reactors and put turbines here and there and kaboom  [strike]explosion[/strike] its now working yay :D\n\ntheres so much in the game that im too lazy to mention, try the demo its great, its the first bit of the game (which lasts like 6-10 hours i think), but keep in mind the game just has so much content for a demo to give an accurate idea of.\nbut anyways\n\nThe Factory Must Grow.", "timestamp_created": 1685776355, "timestamp_updated": 1692817961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139463724": {"recommendationid": "139463724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000556801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1325, "playtime_at_review": 49584, "last_played": 1696166464}, "language": "english", "review": "The ultimate automation game, where needing to move means you haven't automated enough.

The sensation of achievement is unfathomable, from the thrilling beginning of a crash landing on a foreign planet to creating a vast manufacturing empire. The thrill of streamlining processes and automating whatever you can is comparable to enjoying a properly cooked steak while listening to your favourite music.\n\nBut don't be fooled by the seeming simplicity; Factorio's challenge is just as genuine as walking barefoot on a LEGO block. When you believe you have everything under control, the game throws a wrench (or a dozen) into your well-functioning system. Your factory is invaded by alien biters, which causes a panic similar to a cat chasing a laser pointer. The balancing of the electrical grid turns into a unicycle juggling show with flaming chainsaws.\n\nThe dark comedy of Factorio will have you second-guessing your decisions and considering a simpler life as a hermit in the woods. But in the middle of frustration, innovations occur, and your factory once again hums with productivity. The delicious win justifies the nerve-wracking times.\n\nThis game takes pleasure in both your triumph and your misery. It will simultaneously make you feel smart and stupid. But despite everything, you'll be enthralled by the game's compelling gameplay and the prospect of building the ideal mechanized paradise. You'll laugh, weep, and undoubtedly curse like a drunken pirate on Factorio's gloriously chaotic trip.\n\nI sincerely urge any daring factory builders to check out Factorio. Accept the happiness and the sorrow, and remember that they are all a part of the experience. Happy engineering, and long live the spaghetti-free factory!\n", "timestamp_created": 1685307594, "timestamp_updated": 1685307594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

I finally realized I should not have done this and concentrated on progressing the game. I did a lot of deconstruction to improve on what I learned.\n\nEdit 2: With the recent FFFs and knowing what is coming, I am really looking forward to the new content, especially trains.

completely for short but intense bursts, sometimes if you are thoroughly unlucky, you may find yourself enthralled by it for up to a month. Eventually though, you end up moving on, to come back to it once again months later. Factorio is, aside from the enemies of course, one of the most bug-free games available, which is a considerable achievement considering how intricate the game can be. It is also incredibly intuitive in its controls. \n\nThe only thing I would criticise Factorio for is that the ghost system could be better. For example, you have to enable the option to place ghosts if the thing you wish to place is unavailable, which I think should be a default. Also, you can't place ghosts of items you haven't unlocked via research. Finally, you can't just use ghosts to plan.

Have to say that half the fun was designing such a base and half was actually building it! \n\nWhat can I say about the game? Hmm... here are probably plenty of other reviews already for this game praising it and making memes ofc. that I won't have anything innovative or insightful to say at all.\n\nThe thing that absorbs me into this game, is the almost infinite ways in you can play it, all the variations in the way you can build things, all the mods and the fact that it scratches a specific creative itch that no other game seem to be able to scratch.\n\nFrom the speedrun achievements I just did to the megabases from back a few months, from the complicated mod packs I tried to the heavy combat based overhauls. I've been doing a bit of everything and got my fair share of enjoyment from all of that.\n\nAs an electronics based engineer I used to route PCBs back in the day, and this game is very reminiscent of that: electronics circuits laid out in a PCB board... but you also have to design what's inside the ICs.  There's something magical about deciding how to partition complex processes, how to connect them, then routing those connections and seeing them work.\n\nThe best bases I saw over my time playing this game work like a clockwork mechanism and it's often beautiful to watch them go, but even if you've got a base that is not perfect, it's also immensely rewarding to analyse it and try to understand why it isn't working well, and see how doing small tweaks and fixes here and there, produces changes down the line. \n\nThe game is very simulation based, i.e. it's more like a precise simulation than a game: how it all works, and makes sense and has a reason behind it. The way you can form complex parts from simpler ones, and the different forms you can combine them, is what gives this game it's amazing qualities.\n\nI do think that this is one of those games that everyone should try, at least once. It helps in developing your organizational and planning skills, and also applying math, logic, programming and the general creativity needed to design stuff.\n\nNot to forget, that, in case it's not enough, you can make logical circuits inside this game that can compute things and run logic... you can make crazy control logic that can automate things to a level that's almost comparable to a commercial PLC (though the \"language\" used is kinda annoying to work with...) and people has made at least 8 bits CPUs running inside Factorio.\n\nThere's also the combat aspect and the enemies, which... I don't have much to say, I don't like that aspect enough to want to engage too much with it, but luckily the game lets you customize everything and make enemies as relevant (or irrelevant) as you want, even removing them altogether, if you like a pest-free playground :P", "timestamp_created": 1681363599, "timestamp_updated": 1681364524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136606313": {"recommendationid": "136606313", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968944694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 106667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6262, "playtime_at_review": 65223, "last_played": 1696542807}, "language": "english", "review": "Only buy this game if you're prepared to find love.", "timestamp_created": 1681352643, "timestamp_updated": 1681352643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136601126": {"recommendationid": "136601126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880842260", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18605, "last_played": 1693187842}, "language": "english", "review": "you should definitely play if you're prone to addiction", "timestamp_created": 1681342980, "timestamp_updated": 1681342980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136588156": {"recommendationid": "136588156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261230092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 55538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54079, "last_played": 1687717886}, "language": "english", "review": "You blink and several hours have passed.

There is a vibrant modding community on top of this. I do not normally find myself missing a more 3d world like is in satisfactory. Both are good games. Mods are pretty optional. Maps are randomly generated.\n\nThe puzzle side of the game is in finding layouts that work well. Each tile can only have one thing on it, so if you have a 6 lane highway of goods, you can't just shrink it to one lane without penalties to how well things work.\n\nDon't buy this type of game if: You hate math or puzzles and are impatient to see cool things. It is playable in 20 minute to one hour sessions with small goals. But there is not a ton of story and some of the milestones will take 2 hours to achieve after the prior one.\n\nBuy this if: you find the idea cool, can tolerate 8-9th grade algebra (even if you don't use it) and like a genuine feeling of achievement for meeting targets. Most players eventually turn the survival aspects off. It adds to the challenge but not the replay value. My Pro-tip would be to turn base expansion off the first time you play.\n\nBuy Mindustry if you want survival mode to be central to the game.\n\nBuy satisfactory if you want the additional fun of a platformer and exploration game on a predesigned map. It also has the best semi-creative building system of any game I have played. However, it has no real survival beyond learning how to handle aliens while exploring; and I find the management of resources far more nuisancesome than in Factorio.", "timestamp_created": 1679401501, "timestamp_updated": 1679401501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135068667": {"recommendationid": "135068667", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073179128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1696296681}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so cool I wish factories were real", "timestamp_created": 1679359183, "timestamp_updated": 1679359183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135035180": {"recommendationid": "135035180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157595760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1693700693}, "language": "english", "review": "Beware of engineering crack", "timestamp_created": 1679319344, "timestamp_updated": 1679319344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135015272": {"recommendationid": "135015272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188378423", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1670, "last_played": 1679396298}, "language": "english", "review": "autisim the game", "timestamp_created": 1679284638, "timestamp_updated": 1679284638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134990154": {"recommendationid": "134990154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068068260", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7944, "last_played": 1679352903}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is the only thing to bring me happiness in over 10 years. \n", "timestamp_created": 1679252895, "timestamp_updated": 1679252895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134965423": {"recommendationid": "134965423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198984072227", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 45845, "last_played": 1695411599}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just absolutely great.

It's a game that rewards careful planning and execution, while also providing plenty of opportunities for experimentation and creativity.\n\nIn addition to its addictive gameplay, Factorio also boasts an incredible soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's industrial aesthetic. And with a lively and passionate community of players, there's never a shortage of people to play and trade tips with.\n\nOf course, no review of Factorio would be complete without mentioning the game's incredible graphics and attention to detail. From the soaring planes that dot the sky to the curmudgeonly old grandmas that occasionally pop up to offer advice, every aspect of the game is meticulously crafted and rendered.\n\nAll in all, Factorio is a must-play game for anyone who loves strategy, survival, and resource management games.

My day job is as a software engineer and this game scratches all the same itches that led me into said career. I've picked this game up to play a few minutes and then seemingly fallen into a gravity well. What feels like 5 minutes can turn into hours of building, re-building, and debugging my factories.\n\nthe \"vanilla\" game is definitely fun and an excellent value for ~100+ hours at whatever they're currently charging. But this game really shines when it comes to the sometimes complete game overhauls that are possible with the in-game mod system. Space Exploration + Krastorio 2 is a personal favorite. I'm on my second playthrough attempt (~26 hrs or so) after getting ~160 hrs or so into my first playthrough. I started a new one because after a couple hundred hours of experience I found some better QOL mods to play with and I had a better idea of how the game settings I wanted to play with. \"Vanilla\" is great to play with biters in the default settings (maybe a slightly larger starting area), but SE + K2 is a bear if you have to deal with pollution and biter expansion. Pyanodons or Nullius mod-packs will likely be my next playthrough after finishing SE + K2 (still hundreds of hours away). The value of this game with the overhaul mods is absolutely insane!\n\nI also look forward to what the devs have in store for the game expansion. Hopefully it keeps to the same quality and adds even more value to this amazing game.\n\nI can honestly say that this is one of my all-time favorite games. The only game I have more time in is Apex on console, but that is only because of weekly games with friends (plus I've been playing that since launch in 2019).

I bought it on January 21, when I heard about the upcoming price increase.  I first played it on February 4. Today is February 20, it took  me 18 hours of tutorials and 60 hours of actual playing to finish the game. That makes it almost 5 hours per day for more than two weeks. The game is so great and so addictive!\n\nWith a first game I barely scratched its surface, I feel I can spend hundreds of hours of quality time tinkering with my base, expanding, building infrastructure, occasionally going in expeditions to pacify the planet.\n\nThe game is scaling up in a very controllable and beginner friendly way, I was first afraid that while I thought about how to build the base, the natives will kill me, or they would get stronger before I could prepare proper defenses. But actually threat of natives is scaling up mostly with base development, not with time, so one has the luxury to think how to develop the base. \n\nI died three times and reloaded autosave, this  is something I normally do not do, I play ironman with no reloads on strategy games, but those deaths were linked with learning the game: the trains ran me over twice and I built a railway crossing with traffic lights (railway signals); I died once in the alien toxic spit, I was not aware I had to move away from it.\n\nI liked the best that you can spend a lot of time designing the base, but when invariably, the design needs to change, you do not lose the buildings and belts, you just un-deploy them. This makes it so much easier and fun to re-design. The only think lost are the liquids in the pipes.\n\nI need to take a break from playing now, it risks affecting my normal life.\n", "timestamp_created": 1676901704, "timestamp_updated": 1676901704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133217484": {"recommendationid": "133217484", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976541238", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1218, "last_played": 1679726130}, "language": "english", "review": "anomalous goale on the whorizon! build your factor, build your defnenses, lego subsidies using apeterolum and ox THE two chesburger MEAL - large spry - granpa open heart sir gary, spring drink larg sarge so.", "timestamp_created": 1676870172, "timestamp_updated": 1676870172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133200558": {"recommendationid": "133200558", "author": {"steamid": "76561199171233774", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1404, "last_played": 1691504154}, "language": "english", "review": "epic and cool(help i cant close it)", "timestamp_created": 1676843587, "timestamp_updated": 1676843587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133197313": {"recommendationid": "133197313", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960467418", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 52849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52150, "last_played": 1690841381}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game that perfected the genre.

There are more studios than ever before with access to better technology than has ever been available, yet pre-orders, micro-transactions, cosmetics, and subscriptions plague games that are over-marketed, lack content, release while unfinished, and remain unsupported. These are the \"greedy practices\" that have ruined a depressing amount of potentially timeless experiences.\n\nI have yet to see any of this nonsense from Factorio or Wube Software. The game continues to be updated by the developer. Wube strongly supports and incorporates a modding community that has drastically increased the value of the base game over time. In this case, never putting your game on sale is overwhelmingly pro-consumer. Fallout 76 went on sale a month after release, which just meant that everyone that had already bought it had over-paid for that game. Anyone who bought 76 overpaid for the game. The value of the game is protected when it never goes on sale because when you buy it, that's it. No subscriptions, and no grief over not waiting one more week for it to drop 50%. \n\nThen the price is increased by $5. They say because of inflation; I don't know about that, but really who cares? Are you forced to pay another $5 if you already owned it? For anyone who has been enjoying this game any time between 2016 when it came out in early access and January 2023, it's irrelevant. You already own that value. It is absolutely mind-boggling that people are upset over this. If you cared about the game enough to be upset about a price hike, you would have already owned it. We should be celebrating a developer who has continued to refine a game to the point where it warrants a price increase, not saying bullshit like \"don't reward bad practice\". This is the opposite of bad practice.\n\nRant complete. And since this is a review, yes, the game was well worth the $30 I paid for it in 2018. It would be worth $35 if I were buying it today. Wube will continue to have my support as long as they continue to treat consumers and their community with respect as they have so far.", "timestamp_created": 1676683403, "timestamp_updated": 1676683403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132989304": {"recommendationid": "132989304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256300091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 230, "playtime_at_review": 6032, "last_played": 1696355758}, "language": "english", "review": "MMMMM.....

Also ignore my bad wording, it's 1am and the factory is calling me.\n\nFactorio is a simple game: mine ore, process it, use it to research better machines and repeat until you launch your first rocket all while protecting you from those pesky biters. The true beauty lies in your factories ability to scale to unbelievable levels, just look up some mega factories to be amazed, but don't be intimidated. You too can build these enormous factories, the best strategy to build these after launching a rocket is to give yourself goals like researching all sciences, launching a rocket every x minutes, getting all achievements,  \u2026 If you are stuck at some point you can always rely on the amazing userbase who will gladly help you. Another tip I\u2019ll give you is to not immediately look up blueprints when you can\u2019t think of a solution to produce something, try creating your own designs and see where you can improve them. \n\nIf your starting to get bored of the base game you\u2019ll be impressed by the incredible amount of mods, many of these are basically new games (space exploration, seablock, \u2026) and offer new playstyles. Other mods add QOL features (even distribution is the best) or just some new machines or weapons to exterminate some biters. \n\nThe best thing about Factorio is that you can play it with friends, the game even offers some scenarios where you compete against them to see who builds the best factory.\n\nA downside of the game is that the graphics aren\u2019t as fancy as some other factory building games out there. \n\nI can\u2019t really think of many more things to say, so if you want Factorio be sure to try the demo first and may your factory grow!\n", "timestamp_created": 1675297483, "timestamp_updated": 1675297483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132019263": {"recommendationid": "132019263", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987967870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 4527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3754, "last_played": 1695148995}, "language": "english", "review": "I claimed oil fields from my american friend's territory while he was occupied with building trains, this is a very good game.", "timestamp_created": 1675278550, "timestamp_updated": 1675278550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132007794": {"recommendationid": "132007794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272000735", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 7696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1957, "last_played": 1690082285}, "language": "english", "review": "Kill natives, and steal oil.

There is a high degree of focus on organizational throughput and efficient output, which may sound uninteresting at first glance, but I highly recommend trying out this or a game like this to at least get the experience first before casting judgement. I say this as someone who was once skeptical about the entertainment value of creating digital assembly lines, but it turns out that this is a very satisfying gameplay loop. You decide on an item to produce at a certain amount that you want over a set amount of time, then make a system to deliver that item at a specific rate so that you can use them to unlock or in the process of producing new and better items. While that may sound dry (and while it is a very calculation-heavy experience) it doesn't feel dissimilar to heavy grinding in an RPG where you grind in an area to unlock a good skill, that you can then use to grind in a better area for a better skill later. The visuals and plenty of design choices also have a certain charm to them worth noting. Visually, it reminds me of a classic RTS I might have played some as a small child, and the limitations created by being both a top-down 2D game as well as how plenty of the items used in automation work, it makes for even more interesting gameplay due to potentially complicating the organizational process.\n\nThat doesn't mean the game is flawless however. Some of those charming item complications can still be frustrating to deal with. In addition, despite much of the game benefiting from well-calculated production lines, the information presented in-game feels almost useless to the player unless they do even more calculation to come up with the information on production themselves. Or resort to using a third party to do the calculation for you. For instance, if you look at an assembler (mark 1) that's been placed, it's production time listed is 0.5. Not 0.5 a second, just 0.5. This meaning that it is equal to half the player's speed of crafting, which is about 3 and a half seconds if I remember. These bits of extra effort to figure out how much over what period of time, can really add up and makes the experience much less enjoyable for me. Not everyone will agree on that front, but with a game focused on efficiency as much as this one is, I find the unnecessary complication of lacking item information to be unfortunate. It doesn't ruin the game completely for me, but it surprisingly goes a long way in making me prefer other games of this style more than this one. If that doesn't bother you at all, you'll probably love this game and I hope you enjoy losing a few hundred hours of life in trying to make your world have the best factory efficiency possible to build cool stuff like robots.", "timestamp_created": 1674380142, "timestamp_updated": 1674380142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131307093": {"recommendationid": "131307093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212902445", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 8236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4580, "last_played": 1692298374}, "language": "english", "review": "it's good but i'm stupid", "timestamp_created": 1674350888, "timestamp_updated": 1674350888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131200287": {"recommendationid": "131200287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891355631", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1696277589}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game from 8:30 pm to 6:30 am, and I'd do it again any time.", "timestamp_created": 1674214123, "timestamp_updated": 1674214123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131188487": {"recommendationid": "131188487", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124301445", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 21191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1772, "last_played": 1694781261}, "language": "english", "review": "THE FACTORY MUST GROW!

playing Factorio for a while now, and I have to say, it's one of the most addicting games I've ever played. Whether I'm playing solo or with friends, I always find myself coming back for more.\n\nOne of the things that makes Factorio so great is the multiplayer aspect. Playing with friends adds a feeling of camaraderie and really brings something special to the game. Working together to build and manage our factory is a hugely satisfying experience, and it's a lot of fun to strategize and coordinate our efforts.\n\nThe concept of synergy is also a key factor in the game's appeal. Each person has their own role to play in the factory, and working together effectively is crucial to success. This requires communication, teamwork, and coordination, which makes for a highly engaging and satisfying experience.\n\nBut perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of \"Factorio\" is the goal of killing the alien protesters. These creatures are constantly attacking the factory and must be eliminated in order to protect it. This is a fun and satisfying aspect of the game, as it allows players to feel like they are really making a difference and defending their territory.\n\nThe concept of throughput is also a big part of what makes \"Factorio\" so addicting. This refers to the efficiency with which resources are used and items are produced, and it's something that players are constantly striving to improve. Whether it's optimizing production lines or finding new ways to gather resources, there is always room for improvement, which keeps players coming back for more.\n\nOverall, \"Factorio\" is a really great game, especially with multiplayer. The sense of camaraderie and teamwork, combined with the satisfaction of expanding and improving the factory, make for a truly addicting experience. The concepts of synergy and throughput add a layer of depth and strategy to the game, and the goal of killing the alien protesters is a fun and rewarding aspect.

Satisfactory, City Skylines, etc. but factorio looks old and messy from the screenshots- I couldn't comprehend the hostile attack mechanic being anything but annoying. So I didn't bother with it for a while. \nWhen I finally bit the bullet I got totally sucked in. \n\nThe good: \n- That hostile enemy mechanic? Yeah it's fantastic. The biters serve as the pressure to progress as they evolve over time, if you can't keep up you will be overrun. You cannot simply expand your factory without some consideration to the location of biter bases and the effect this may have on your base. A great way to keep the pacing of the game up. \n\n- Mechanics are complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to not be frustrating. \n\n- There's a lot of in-depth tutorials and playable scenarios built into the game to help you learn. I personally skipped all of these, got stuck, and went back... they're pretty helpful. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Despite how much is explained to you, there is still a pretty steep learning curve.

I tried multiple times in the past to play this game but never really got further than green science, or oil. Then I would take a break and restart months later. Sometimes I'd turn the bitters on and sometimes off. But recently I decided to sit down and try to \"tackle\" factorio. \nMy latest attempt at playing this gaming was one were I put the settings for the \"rail world\", where it makes resources far more abundant, but also further away, encouraging trains. And I really liked the trains. I also turned the bitters off, cause I can handle them, they just became too much a distraction from building the main base. Anyways, after 28 hours I beat factorio on these settings. Just sending the rocket into space. My factory wasn't the cleanest, and I felt like I was constantly fixing bottlenecks or logistic problems all the way till the end. Where my base was just limping trying to build the rocket.\nBut still after all of that I had a great time. I don't know if I will return to this game, probably will, but it was a fun time. Though do be careful it is pretty addicting. I started seeing belts and filters when I closed my eyes after playing this game for a few hours, lol.\nI also now get why people find this one so great and what other games with automation have been inspired by from this game. I know this isn't the game that started the automation genre, but I do feel like I can feel the DNA of this game in other games as well.", "timestamp_created": 1666543029, "timestamp_updated": 1666543167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124238196": {"recommendationid": "124238196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083517758", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 13016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8459, "last_played": 1684952040}, "language": "english", "review": "Just all round great game.

Many simple mechanics, for you to apply in complex ways. It's sort of like a puzzle game, but each individual puzzle is very simple. The challenge is that there are a lot of those small ones and they have to be pieced together with greater and greater intricacy. When you learn of a new way to solve an older problem, you might just gleefully destroy everything you've built to rebuild it better.\n\nThis game doesn't play tricks to keep you engaged. There's no grind for permanent character upgrades, RNG bs, fetch quests, pay to win, \"seasons\", or whatever. It's simply one of the most engaging, cerebral experiences in gaming.\n\nThe modding community is amazing and the depth of available overhaul mods is unreal.

I have belts carrying iron, coal, and my sanity. If only I could automate my real-life chores as effectively...\n\nWarning: Factorio will mess with your perception of time. You'll think you've played for an hour, but in reality, it's been a week, and your boss is about to file a missing person report. I recommend installing an alarm clock that slaps you awake every few hours, just so you remember to eat, sleep, and maybe even breathe.\n\nThe graphics might not be jaw-dropping, but they're like the dorky high school crush you secretly adored. The real beauty lies in the intricate gameplay and the satisfaction of seeing your automated empire thrive. Who needs AAA explosions when you have the symphony of humming machines?\n\nIn conclusion, Factorio is the ultimate addiction for aspiring engineers, chaos enthusiasts, and those who think Tetris is child's play. It'll test your patience, creativity, and most importantly, your ability to function in the real world.

From the moment you fire up the game, you're thrust into a hypnotic trance, conducting an orchestra of industrial madness.\n\nPicture this: a bevy of metallic ants crawling across your screen, spewing out contraptions that defy the laws of physics. It's like a surreal ballet of gears and gizmos, each pirouette more absurd than the last. You'll find yourself entranced, questioning your sanity as you embark on this chaotic journey.\n\nThe graphics, oh, the graphics! They're like a pi\u00f1ata of psychedelic wonder, bursting with colors that tickle your retinas. It's as if the developers summoned a troupe of caffeinated monkeys armed with paintbrushes to craft a hallucinatory dreamscape. Prepare to have your eyeballs melted and reassembled into a kaleidoscope of neon delight!\n\nThe gameplay is a fiesta of confusion and logic-defying puzzles. You'll spend hours wrangling belts, assembling contraptions, and battling hordes of alien creatures with nothing but your trusty wrench. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a unicycle on a tightrope across a volcano. Utterly bonkers, I tell you!\n\nFactorio's soundtrack is the sonic equivalent of a fiesta in your ears. It's a wild fusion of techno beats, mariachi melodies, and the occasional squealing of robotic parrots. Each track is designed to make your hips sway and your heart race, even if you're just sitting on your sofa, munching on a bag of nachos.\n\nAnd let's not forget the multiplayer experience! Picture this: a raucous soir\u00e9e of gamers, shouting orders, frantically tinkering with contraptions, and occasionally bursting into spontaneous dance-offs. It's like a virtual mosh pit of engineering enthusiasts, all vying for the coveted title of \"Supreme Factory Overlord.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Factorio is a zesty, mind-bending extravaganza that defies all rational thought. It's a game that challenges your senses, tickles your imagination, and makes you question the very fabric of reality.

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I have one map that i have about 2500 hours in. I keep coming back to that one after finding new designs and trying them out in that old map to see how effective it is in a MUCH bigger base.\n\nAlso, i haven't even touched mods yet.

If you like games with excellent QoL features, easy mod support, multiplayer that's quick and easy to set up, and countless hours of replayability, then Factorio should be on your list. It runs beautifully, even on low end hardware, because of excellent optimization done by these developers. \n\nIf you like the idea of creating a factory and optimizing the logistical systems within, then this game is for you. If you like waging an environmental war using pollution to drive the natives into killing themselves on your walls, then this game is for you. If you like trains, this game is for you. There are lots of reasons to like the game. It's well made, better than most. If any of this sounds appealing to you, do yourself a favor and grab this game.\n\nUnless you don't like the idea of spending all night playing because you're too immersed in the game to stop, I guess. Then you probably should stay away for your own health and safety.\n\n\n[h1] Regarding the price increase Complaints [/h1]\n\nMost products in the world go up in price over time due to inflation...it's actually somewhat strange that games sort of don't. Things tend to be priced at what people are willing to pay; here we see a dev treating their game as a product, and pricing accordingly. People are still buying it despite it not being on sale, so a sale is clearly not needed to get people playing it. It's [i]still[/i] selling well 7 years later? I know it's tough to swallow, but maybe that means its underpriced. If you bought in while it was undervalued, you're lucky. If not, you're just paying what it's worth.\n\nAdditionally, lots of games increase their price. There are lots of reasons for this, whether it's leaving early access, adding substantial amounts of content since launch, or to account for expansions that have been wrapped into the original game after they've been out for ages: World of Warcraft is a good example of this. \n\nThe oddest part here about the complaints is that the people complaining are, almost by definition, customers who are in no way affected by the price increase. It's petty, childish, and shows a lack of understanding of economics to complain so bitterly as to join a review bomb about it. A sale is used to lower the price temporarily in order to [i]sell the game[/i] when the normal price isn't moving the volume of transactions you're hoping for. Factorio has seen remarkably consistent good sales volume, so why would they put it on sale? It's entitled to think that a developer should put a game on sale simply because there are people who haven't played the game yet. By that logic, developers should all just give their games away for free so everybody could play them.\n\n[h1] TLDR: Game good, worth the (new) price, ignore the review bomb bumpkins who disable comments on their reviews [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1674333613, "timestamp_updated": 1674334593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516034185886383057", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137750125": {"recommendationid": "137750125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377498542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1021, "last_played": 1694632641}, "language": "english", "review": "Generally a great game.

The world of Factorio is a place where you can let your inner mad scientist run wild.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive and satisfying. The sheer number of things you can build and automate is staggering. You start with nothing, but before you know it, you're managing a massive factory, producing goods to sell, and defending yourself against hordes of aliens.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's like the developers took inspiration from a 1980s sci-fi movie and cranked it up to 11. The music is catchy and upbeat, making you feel like you're in the middle of an epic adventure.\n\nFactorio is the kind of game that will suck you in for hours on end. You'll lose track of time as you optimize your production lines and defend against alien attacks. But even with all the challenges the game throws at you, you'll never feel overwhelmed.\n\nSo if you're looking for a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, Factorio is the game for you. Just be prepared for the depression-inducing environment, but hey, maybe that's what makes the game so addictive.", "timestamp_created": 1678789439, "timestamp_updated": 1678789439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513556599617004395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136438364": {"recommendationid": "136438364", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091797728", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1689391318}, "language": "english", "review": "-----     -----       ------      ---------    -----          -           -----\n-          -     -        -                  -           -      -         -        -         -\n-          -----        -                  -            -----         -           -----\n----            -        -----           -\n-\n-\n-\n-", "timestamp_created": 1681078784, "timestamp_updated": 1681078784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513552069664001465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146005876": {"recommendationid": "146005876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123606517", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "playtime_at_review": 4768, "last_played": 1696365663}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Do you have soo much time and dont know where to spend it?[/h1]\n\nHere is the solution!\n\n50 hour just the  first vanilla gameplay, put 3 mods in, now you reach the first 3 potions within 50 hours.\n\n[I]Bit overpriced but very big factory go brrr[/I]", "timestamp_created": 1694289204, "timestamp_updated": 1694289204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124835484": {"recommendationid": "124835484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981313892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 29337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24936, "last_played": 1687698288}, "language": "english", "review": "The factory must grow.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you Factorio", "timestamp_created": 1672910772, "timestamp_updated": 1672910772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0,

It does not have enough polish or dynamic content to make you engaged any more than a playthrough and it relies heavily on modders keeping you entertained. \n\n[h1]\ud83c\udf08Never Ending Freebies\ud83c\udf08[/h1]\nGame is designed around producing as much stuff as possible. Producing stuff for the sake of producing more stuff. \n[list]\n[b][i]Power Generation[/i][/b]\n[*]One of the areas where this is apparent is power generation. In this game, it is simplified to the point of absurdity. Only coal power is somewhat balanced method. Solar panels are pollution free and even generate electricity at night. However, for mega factories you need nuclear power. Nuclear power at first seems to require a lot of uranium ore, however there is Kovarex enrichment process which converts all of your excessive U-238 to useful U-235. However, that is not how enrichment process works at all. This process defies laws of thermodynamics and produces more energy from a closed system than you inputted. This results in you producing an infinite amount of electricity without needed to worry about running out of fuel. Since nuclear power produces a ton of electricity and fuel for it is practically infinite, a player does not need to consider electrical management in its Factory design. Factories as a result tend to be grossly inefficient and it is designed that way to crank as big of the numbers as possible.\n\n[b][i]Modules & Beacons[/i][/b]\n[*]I never liked modules, because they demand you to rethink how you design your base from what game just taught you. Then they introduce arcade-like stackable bonuses like -50% electricity consumption which somehow directly relates to pollution. Then you get speed modules which can add up to 150% speed and combine that with 50% extra speed. You do get ridiculous performance gains. This can be used as a lazy excuse not to design a better factory, because you can just make it magically far better or it can be used to inflate production at a whim instead of building more lines or just using lower end assemblers. They also trivialise things like pollution management in this game. This mechanic breaks a lot of systems in this game and it is done to inflate players production quotas and to allow them to control production/pollution speed with a switch of a button. This raises a question for me. Why you can't just design a factory to do such a thing? Isn't designing a factory the whole point in Factorio? As it happens, no it is not. Factory must grow, as they say. The whole point of this game are big numbers as you produce stuff for stuff's sake.\n\n[b][i]Conveyor Belts[/i][/b]\n[*]Conveyor belts are another affront to God. It defies natural order of things and is an infinite energy generator. You do not need to fuel it or to maintain it. It is a perfect solution to solve all your logistics needs for free. This had stuck with me, because I remember playing Settlers 2 and how much fun I had in that game managing roads and logistics of my workers going to the various production buildings and bringing back goods. Logistics of an economy game was always the part which I enjoyed the most. This part is greatly simplified in Factorio. Instead you have a perfect line which delivers goods anywhere you want to quite extreme speeds. Massive speed of Express Belts allows players to fully saturate a single belt without having to think amount multi-belt approach due to bandwidth limitations. \n\n[b][i]Drones[/i][/b]\n[*]These little fellows actually surprised me, because they are fun to use and ability to construct factories from blueprints on global map is actually a very useful feature as it is an auto repair. However, that is just another example how logistics is overly simplified in this game. Drones allow you to transport anything anywhere without a need to worry about physical connections. They essentially nullify need for logistics for anything, but most volume intensive tasks. Since electricity is essentially free in this game, drones also become a free tool to use.\n[/list]\n[h1]\u2622\ufe0fCommunity\u2622\ufe0f[/h1]\nGames like this often attract people with deep personal issues who use games as an escape mechanism. Such people often make everyone else as miserable as they are. I tried to share my experience in Steam forum, but it is an open battleground. People can't accept that a person might have something negative to say. They do not understand what an opinion is. They try to argue against an opinion and to prove that your opinion is wrong and their opinion is right. They pretend to talk in place of developers and create toxic, unwelcoming place where you must either fall into the party lines of \"FACTORY MUST GROW AT ALL COSTS\" or get ready for constant harassment and questioning. These people will contest literally everything you say. Will scream how wrong you are at everything and then immediately drop the conversation in the middle of discussion and never talk about it again.\n\nHowever, I kept pushing through not for them, but for my right to use public places to express my own experiences. I'm sharing more detailed version of them here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/Calicifer/discussions/0/3824158244554053005/\n\nIf you want to see what a mess this community is, you can go to watch circus here:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/427520/discussions/0/3826410044369061413/?tscn=1689276285\n\nI made a video which goes into more details to some issues which I had in this game. Mind you, not all of them are bugs.\nhttps://youtu.be/ITaeXU8L9OQ\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udccbAn Exhaustive Conclusion\ud83d\udccb[/h1]\nFactorio is a long game. It is a giant time commitment. It was fun at times, bothersome at other moments and plain boring in the end. It front loads its difficulty at player at the start and then proceeds to simplify all the processes after mid game. However, mid game was where I had most fun in trying to figure out and do something unique. After that, it was about redesigning my base over and over again to meet ever increasing production demands. Then it was about constantly doing mundane stuff and connecting more base materials supply. In the end, I achieved sustainable production which allowed me to fully complete the game. It felt empty and hollow as it overstayed its welcome. It drags everything mercilessly. You get unreasonably high requirements of everything and thus you have to spend a lot of time growing your factory. It constantly shifts what you need, from where you need it and how much you need it. This drags out gameplay and complicates it to players which causes high drop out rates even among veterans who tried main campaign many times, but dropped it. Fully completing vanilla experience is a chore. Then you do it, it just feels empty as game has nothing else to offer.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Calicifer/discussions/0/3836550120035043021/][i]Calicifer's Reviews[/i][/url]\n[quote]If you are interested reading full review (in this case there are a lot more) or want to discuss something with me, please follow the provided link.

From the moment I fired it up, I knew I was in for a treat. This game is a masterpiece of engineering and management, delivering an addictive blend of resource gathering, automation, and problem-solving that keeps me glued to my screen for hours on end.\n\nThe learning curve might be a bit steep, but the feeling of accomplishment when you optimize your production lines and witness your factory humming with efficiency is incomparable. Every challenge is an opportunity to refine and expand, always pushing you to think a step ahead. It's an endless puzzle, and I love it!\n\nThe game's graphics may not be cutting-edge, but they exude a charming retro vibe that grows on you. The sound design is simple yet effective, complementing the gameplay perfectly without ever being intrusive. The modding community adds even more value, introducing new features, scenarios, and quality-of-life improvements.\n\nOne of the aspects that truly sets Factorio apart is its cooperative multiplayer. Teaming up with friends to tackle ambitious projects and fend off the relentless biters makes for unforgettable gaming sessions. The collaborative element brings a whole new dimension to the game, and you'll find yourself hooked for countless cooperative adventures.\n\nThe developers deserve immense praise for their ongoing dedication to improving and expanding the game. Frequent updates and engaging communication with the community showcase their passion for the project.\n\nHowever, I must warn you: Factorio is highly addictive. Once you start building your factories and optimizing your production chains, time loses its meaning. \"Just one more automation tweak\" quickly turns into a marathon gaming session. Prepare to sacrifice sleep, for Factorio's allure is irresistible.\n\nIn conclusion, Factorio is a must-play for any fan of strategy, management, or engineering games. It's a delightfully addictive experience that rewards creativity and problem-solving in equal measure. Factorio's replayability and endless possibilities ensure that it will remain a staple in my gaming library for years to come.", "timestamp_created": 1691147331, "timestamp_updated": 1691147331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505208373069763184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131422965": {"recommendationid": "131422965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420520630", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3029, "last_played": 1675006673}, "language": "english", "review": "No crypto here", "timestamp_created": 1674505125, "timestamp_updated": 1674505125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504896640777587891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136970074": {"recommendationid": "136970074", "author": {"steamid": "76561199444636392", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1681935884}, "language": "english", "review": "Ther is cock roach", "timestamp_created": 1681930096, "timestamp_updated": 1681930096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504820942878723145", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146445088": {"recommendationid": "146445088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186631423", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "playtime_at_review": 12754, "last_played": 1695787538}, "language": "english", "review": "The Factory Must Grow", "timestamp_created": 1694922508, "timestamp_updated": 1694922508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504716992378234863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146440467": {"recommendationid": "146440467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300053966", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 23852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23831, "last_played": 1694917243}, "language": "english", "review": "There.

Then I encountered the maddeningly addictive, soul-snatching world of Factorio by the devious masterminds at Wube Software. With just 11 hours of playtime, I was already a lost cause, my soul firmly in the game's clutches as I obsessively tinkered with conveyor belts, robotic arms, and fended off feisty extraterrestrial menaces.\n\nFactorio's gameplay is like a sweetly crooning siren, beckoning players into a labyrinth of production lines and resource management so intense it makes your head spin. The seemingly innocent graphics soon reveal their true nature as your sprawling, chaotic industrial empire comes to life before your very eyes. It's as if the game murmurs, \"Surrender, mortal. Your soul is mine!\" And let's be honest, who wouldn't succumb to such a tantalizingly treacherous temptation?\n\nAmidst the mind-boggling complexity of managing an ever-growing factory, the developers somehow found the perfect way to inject humor into the mix. Quirky pop culture references, sly puns, and subtle jabs at your own sanity are cleverly woven into the game, leaving you chuckling maniacally as your factory spirals into a frenzy of mayhem and automation.\n\nThe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, however, is the multiplayer mode, where you can team up with (or battle against) friends and strangers, sharing both the joys and woes of interstellar conquest. Is there anything more hilarious than watching your buddy accidentally launch a rocket at their own factory? I think not!\n\nWith its devilishly addictive gameplay, cunningly deceptive graphics, and irresistible wit, Factorio is an absolute must-play for gamers craving a challenge that transcends the ordinary. So, what are you waiting for? Strap on your hard hat, join the riotous rollercoaster of factory madness, and embrace the soul-stealing hilarity that is Factorio!", "timestamp_created": 1681870597, "timestamp_updated": 1681870597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136196184": {"recommendationid": "136196184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363607510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1080353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11014, "playtime_at_review": 1029729, "last_played": 1696415105}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the greatest games of all time .. playing big mods like space exploration or Kastorio2 are real challenges, and I have had thousands of hours of building the best bases .. and although i do play a range of other games from Far Cry to ATS, this is always the goto game for me, 10/10.

I played for the first time, having no prior knowledge and not even doing the tutorial. It was definitely not bad. \n\nA few hours later, I was learning but it was still just good to me. However, a month later, I played the game again on my own, to get the achievements because I like getting all achievements in games. This was when it clicked. I looked at the clock, it was 9 am. I looked at it again, it was 3 pm. The next time I looked, it was nearly 9 pm. I had been hooked. It was a strange feeling. I hadn't felt this way about a game in a long time. The last time I felt time passing by as quick was with Civilization 6. Yes, I have been addicted to games before and played them all day, like Minecraft or Don't Starve Together, but they never made me forget about the time. Five minutes in Factorio seems to turn into 5 hours real quick. I, then, understood the hype and how addictive it was. \n\n128 hours later, I have gotten all achievements. And now, I taut this as being one of the greatest games of all time.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1673063095, "timestamp_updated": 1673063095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129866333": {"recommendationid": "129866333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046806959", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1628294343}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good", "timestamp_created": 1672589356, "timestamp_updated": 1672589356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129844371": {"recommendationid": "129844371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414255202", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1249, "last_played": 1691996617}, "language": "english", "review": "-crash land on a planet\n-drain all natural resources\n-destroy ecosystem with pollution\n-use natural resources to create weapons\nof mass destruction such as artillery and atomic bombs\n-use weapons to exterminate primitive local species\n-repeat until planet is so fucked up you can leave\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1672568342, "timestamp_updated": 1672568342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128568972": {"recommendationid": "128568972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004861048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31068, "last_played": 1689541060}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game", "timestamp_created": 1671054439, "timestamp_updated": 1671054439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124969956": {"recommendationid": "124969956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085465624", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 63683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47218, "last_played": 1695012511}, "language": "english", "review": "n1", "timestamp_created": 1667623653, "timestamp_updated": 1667623653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73670020": {"recommendationid": "73670020", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995285041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 97169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62513, "last_played": 1604524109}, "language": "english", "review": "I would have reviewed this sooner, but that would mean leaving the factory, and the factory must grow", "timestamp_created": 1596397897, "timestamp_updated": 1596397897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4850, "votes_funny": 2450, "weighted_vote_score": "0.980909347534179688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22390398": {"recommendationid": "22390398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061371999", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 10586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5660, "last_played": 1671839105}, "language": "english", "review": "I started a co-op factory with a close friend. After a day of work, I stepped back, looked at what we built, and came to some realizations.\n\n1) I have no fucking idea whats going on in this factory\n2) Half the components that directly interact with each other aren't even near one another, one of the machines producing copper cable for another machine to assemble into circuit boards is halfway across the god damn refinery\n3) 90% of the conveyor belts are underground, and the rest are going so many directions this thing looks like a ball of yarn\n4) There is coal fucking EVERYWHERE\n5) I maintain enough sanity to count to 5\n6) Staring at this thing makes my eyes itch\n7) Looking away makes my brain itch\n\nThe scariest part is that it keeps getting bigger, and every time it gets bigger it somehow becomes MORE labrynthine. One of those fucking conveyor belts goes all the way around the entire factory to deliver steel plates to a single assembler thats making bloody gears, and its right next to the refinery itself!\n\nSometimes the factory breaks. We don't usually notice because of how much of a mess this thing is, and the breaks we do spot are often half an hour old and are a recurring problem. Rather than fix it, we simply unjam the machine and ignore it until it breaks again. The biggest problem to fixing it comes from our production lines. Normal production lines look like a grid. Ours looks like you threw a bunch of squares into a bowl of spaghetti noodles and gave the bowl to a five year old for a period of one to five minutes. This proccess results in either an empty bowl and a full five year old, a floor covered in noodles, or spaghetti all over the walls and ceiling with the squares nowhere to be found. Knowing the trend in increasing chaos and complexity the factory exhibits, probably all three.\n\nThe factory is an empodiment of madness incomprehensible even to the men who built it, laid every unholy circuit of conveyor belt, a thousand arms madly spinning every second, countless plates of copper and iron in a complex dance the likes of which is unseen in the realm of mere mortals. There are sections that I have no idea how they work, and I BUILT THEM.\n\nThe factory grows more complex with each passing second and more convoluted every milisecond. Perhaps the reason is in part due to each segment being constructed with no plans for future additions, then the future additions were constructed by forcibly adapting the existing segments, usually by shoving more tubes into it rather than actually redesigning it, and these futrue additions are also not planned for expansion. The end result is a cluster-fuck so large in magnitude, the last time a cluster-fuck rivaled it in size, God smote the town and turned its inhabitants into salt. Unfortunately no god can save us from this... thing.\n\nHaving expanded it further its almost as if the factory has a mind of its own, an ever hungry consciousness burning with dark malevolence and the need to grow. It infects all who stand in its presence, compelling them to add to it. A hundred furnaces belch smoke and the black blood of the earth is torn from its cradle to fuel the fires of industry. The ecosystem is demolished and the skin of the planet is rent and shattered for its glittering treasures, tossed into the inferno of a thousand stone and metal prisons to be transformed, used to expand the malignant blight upon the world that we brought. Ten thousand steel cogs turn and steam fills the air as the never ending fires boil the oceans away to power the sprawling spiderweb of mechanised mayhem, ordered chaos at its purest, a hundred thousand plates of steel and copper cycle and swirl in patterns barely knowable by the very people that created them.\n\nEach day, the red and green fluids are pumped into glowing crystalline globes, each sparking and burning, discovering new knowledge and new machines. The factory grows. Each advance in technology only complicates matters. The factory grows. The new advances create a need for new resources. The factory grows. The new resources require new means of transportation. The factory grows. The new transportation feeds new machines that burn the new resources to produce blue fluids to discover new technology. The factory grows. The blue fluids feed the globes to reveal new truths, beginning the vicious cycle anew, a neverending circle of destruction and growth that will only end when every corner of the planet is scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet will never be scoured clean. The factory grows. The planet is infinite in size. The factory grows. The game will never be over.\n\nThe factory grows.\n\n\n\nEpilogue:\n\n//: Date: 6/21/[ERROR_NULL_VALUE]\n\nResources have dried up again. The factory consumes all within its reach, insatiable in its hunger. Though it had experienced full production stoppages in the past, the factory could never be eliminated from the planet by the natives, for the sun itself powered the beams of destruction that maintained its borders. Within the creaking, ancient cogs and permanent haze of foul and polluted smoke, a single humanoid shape slowly rises to its feet. Aged, failing flesh and bone long ago replaced with steel and chrome, once polished and clean, now weathered by uncountable years of exposure to acid rain and blackened by thick, choking smog, form its excuse for a body. It could have left while it was still human, before it was consumed in body by the foundry it created to escape. It never had a chance to leave, mind and soul devoured in the pursuit of freedom. With slow, clanking steps and the steady drip of oil from its joints, like a bleeding mechanical nightmare brought to hideous life, it stands and rasps as it moves for the exit. Behind it, a thousand drones rise like a plague of locusts, ready to continue the endless harvest. As the abomination that was once a man steps towards the gates of the factory, a mighty space faring vessel lies decrepit in its dry dock deep within the core of the facility. It was supposed to be a way off the planet, the whole reason for the factory's construction. But soon, the building of the factory became the means and the end, no thought other than the constant urge to grow in its mind.\n\nThe only machine resembling the human form in the entire world stepped out into the barren wasteland of the ruined world. A keening, howling wind tears across the surface, forests destroyed by the ruined atmosphere no longer keeping it in check.\n\nIt is the cry of a dead world, echoing forever on a planet overtaken by the machine.", "timestamp_created": 1460533952, "timestamp_updated": 1508698005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2687, "votes_funny": 3433, "weighted_vote_score": "0.979726552963256836", "comment_count": 278, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60652002": {"recommendationid": "60652002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085092191", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3703, "last_played": 1618027260}, "language": "english", "review": "Crash landed on an alien world.\nPlan was to build a rocket and go home.\nBut now...\n\nNow my factory has pumped so much pollution into the environment that it has twisted the once docile wildlife into things of nightmares. \n\nConveyor belts stretch for miles in all directions.

Spaghetti is fun, until it isn't because you can't send enough material down the entire belt, and there's no room to supplement it down the line.\nRule #4. When you have backups, start storing extras in chests. You'll need it later.\nRule #5. Crap, I'm out of copper. Get more copper.\nRule #6. Create dedicated factory towns for iron plates and copper plates, and build gear wheels and copper cables on site. It's much more efficient than trying to transport them.\nRule #6. Wait, there is automation for automation? Flying robots? Check.\nRule #7. Aliens love radars. Don't put radars near things that matter (like your steam engines) unless you support them with enough turrets.\nRule #7-a. Flamethrowers are your friend for killing aliens. Unless you're in the middle of your town, in which case they are not.\nRule #7-b. Same goes with atomic weapons. When you're not actively fighting outside your base, remove atomic bombs from your hotbar unless you want a very expensive mistake (read: hole) in your factory.\nRule #8. Take enough ammo with you when you go to fight aliens. It's lots of fun to run out of ammo in the middle of a battle, and it goes quickly.\nRule #8-b. Personal laser turrets are a gigantic step forward in biter-fighting - just ensure you have enough power to keep them going.\nRule #9. Don't stand on train tracks when trains are automated.\nRule #10. Use the little overlay in map view to see where your power poles are. Create redundancies so an entire section of your base is not dependent on a single pole somewhere (you will accidentally destroy or remove it at some point, guaranteed - ahem, cars).\nRule #11. Blueprints are amazing, and the community is fantastic at sharing their different creations. Try them out, and then see if you have a better or more creative way to make something work (if you want).\nRule #12. Deconstruction planning forests is amazing.

For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.

I have looked for a game like this for years. A game that is survival, but you can thrive instead of just surviving by making robots and machines do everything for you. I have already recomended this game to 5 or 6 of my friends. If you have the money, and like using your brain to overcome problems and build things, BUY THIS GAME!\n\nThe good\n-Great for unlimited play. There is always more to do.\n-Multiplayer is super fun, and much less laggy then anticipated.\n-The enemy progression system is near perfect\n-Runs very well, even with over 300 robots all doing different things on the screen.\n-Very customisable world\n-Very smooth controls\n-The combat robots are awesome\n-Modules and suit upgrades out the wazoo\n-The logic systems and rail systems are very polished and well done\n-Most early access games I have played, I have found many bugs. I have not found a single bug in this game.\n-The blueprint system is easy, efficiant, and well done.\n-Robots are very polished and do what they're supposed to very well.\n-Devs are awesome!\n-Best builder/tower defence game I have ever played\n\n\nCould use some work\n-Vehicles are a little sub par, but still fun to use\n-Armor augmentatin system is a little broken. I should not be able to run faster then a train, or take on a max level enemy base with a shotgun\n-Inserter speed is limited for extreme late game. I found myself needing 2 or 3 fast inserters just to load enough copper into one assembler for wire\n-lack of enemy types\n-Water and lake boundries, and some way to clear them or build over them.\n-not many methods of producing power\n\nThe Bad (most being fixed in updates coming soon most likely)\n-A lack of end game. Once the rocket is launched, you have nothing else to progress too, aside from expanding your current base. \n-Weapons. There are 6 weapons in the game, 3 are shit and one is god tier, will most likely be balanced soon.\n\nThings I would personally like to see/Pipe dreams\n-A gamemode or checkbox of \"Extreme survival\" requiring you to eat, drink, and sleep through nights. Enemies may have more advanced AI in this gamemode.\n-Space. Although this is a little far fetched, add the ability to set up a space station, mine astroids or even moons. Or even travel to a different planet all together. Including a sort of out of atmosphere solar panel, which was what I thought the satalite was going to do.\n-More biomes. Some biomes containing different enemy types, or some having extreme tempatures that require a suit module to survive in, but also much richer in resources\n-More power production methods! Nuclear power for examble.\n-A sort of \"Deep mining\" drill. A drill that extracts ore from deep underground, in a much slower, power consuming fassion. This could also be a good way to get end game ore.\n-End game ore. Uranium, Diamond, Platinum. \n-An enemy \"Hive Mind\". Sort of like the worms that spawn, only huge. Controlls the underlings, and directs them. Destroy hive mind, end all sort of alien attacks in that biome. Destroying the hive mind would need to be extreamly difficult.\n-Air vehices. I would love to be able to quickly get around the base or area without worrying about hitting a pipe or electrical pole. Also including a \"Sky transport\", like a end game train that does not need tracks.\n-Differenty types of miners, more suitable and productive for late game.\n-The ability to grow trees and cut them down, and produce charchoal from the wood, leading to a renewable source of coal.\n-Crops, either to eat and regain health, or to use as bio-fuel. \n-More and more exotic types of weapons. We have the alien artifacts, why not use them to make an acid launcher or a plasma beam?\n-More natual fluids aside from water. Have a rarer type of volcanic biome that produces lava, which can be used to power thermal generators.\n-More enemies! More powerfull versions of the origional enemies. A type of behomoth biter multiplied by 5. Flying enemies, subterainian enemies, water based enemies, enemy base levels, producing higher level enemies and giving more artifacts when destroyed.\n-Some drop from basic enemies. Chitin used for armor, Meat used to cook, Spitter acid as an alternate use to make batteries or poison bullets, worm teeth for drill augmentations, the list goes on.\n-Robot companions. Robots that help you with things other then fighting for 120 secconds or building stuff.\n-Neutral mosters. Things like wild space animals that don't want to kill you. Possibly tamable and kept as a pet or something\n-More train types! Trains requiring advanced fuel, or even magnetic trains that travel hundreds of miles an hour.\n-Teleporters(?) requring disgusting amounts of power, but able to transfer anything, including items, over great distances instantly. Cound even include coming from space or an astroid to the home world, requiring some sort of airlock.\n-Pressure chambers! Pressurising air to make types of materials, like alloys or more compressed liquids.\n-Steam workshop support! There are a lot of great mods out there, and the steam workshop just makes them accessed easier.\n-PvP or factions maybe?\n-Proximity voice chat?\n\nSimply put, I love this game. I have never even heard of these devs until now, and they are some of the best devs I have seen.

Factorio is, simply put, a fun videogame about building things with an industrial space theme. If you liked tycoon games like RollerCoaster Tycoon, Transport Tycoon, Railroad Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, or citybuilding ones like SimCity, Cities Skylines or Caesar 3, you probably already know the basic gist. You build a sprawling factory to gradually achieve a single, big task, and it's really fun to watch it in motion. The big twist on the formula that Factorio brings is that it borrows crafting elements now common in modern mainstream games to make the building less a matter of using money to make money, and more about crafting basic resources into usable items. It just so happens that these items are buildings that you build your factory out of. In essence, you're building a factory-building factory, hence the common mantra \"the factory must grow\".\n\nThis self-serving growth isn't a goal unto itself, though. At the top of the crafting pyramid are the so-called \"science packs\", a complex item that exists solely to be consumed to progress the game's tech tree. Said tech tree starts you off with simple tools to familiarize yourself with the basics of mining and smelting, and eventually branches out towards truer and truer automation, culminating in a factory that literally builds itself using thousands of flying construction drones. The mere prospect of that can make a new player's head spin, but in reality the game actually gets easier once everything gets automated, since you can just sit back and watch things happen. The ultimate goal is naturally to climb to the very top of the tech tree, however you don't have to worry about aimlessly building up to that point since there are plenty of interesting intermediate steps worthy of investigation. The game sustains a steady drip-feed of new technologies that often change up the formula completely, such as new forms of power production, item transportation or even access to completely unique production chains like liquid oil and radioactive uranium, so you're very unlikely to go bored during the 40-60 hour playthrough. \n\nIn terms of challenge, it can seem as though the game is very complex and hard, but as I said before, the bigger your factory gets, the more you can afford to chill. For this reason the game rarely gets described as \"hard\", but it's not exactly a cakewalk either. You do get an infinite amount of space to build your factory however you want, but at the end of the day the resources won't craft themselves, and a bare minimum of planning is required to lay things out at least a bit logically. You can build your mines on the opposite end of the factory to the smelters and connect them with a single line of belt, but you can't expect to smelt a lot of items that way (been there, done that). Not that it's necessarily a bad way of doing things, but let's just say there's better ways as well. This extends to practically all facets of Factorio, making it a game that's easy to play (and beat), but practically impossible to master.\n\nHopefully this has been at least a bit helpful to anyone trying to get a clearer picture of this game and understand why people praise it so much. Needless to say, I love it lots, still returning to it now and then for a playthrough whenever I don't have better things to do that week. It's well and truly one of the best games to come out of the past decade and I wish more people built up the courage to give it a shot. Did you notice there is a free demo?

In those 35 years I've seen and played lots of great games. Some have been challenging, or amazing, or addictive, or simply awesome. But there's been two that beat all others by lengths: Diablo II - and Factorio. When you can't wait to get home, turn on your rig and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Sanctuario, or some distant, hostile planet you had just crashed on.\n\nFactorio is not about aliens or warfare. It's all about base building, resource management and automation. Aliens and warfare just add another challenge. The actual challenge comes from figuring out a better, more efficient way. It's about calculating ratios, optimizing routes to and from your storages. Building better setups. More often than not you will find that \"better\" [i]has to[/i] include \"better looking\". It's the perfect game for challenging your OCD (watch any of Nilaus' videos).\n\nThe game itself is still in Early Access (as of October 2018) but is already the most polished and bug-free game I've ever played. Yes, it's only 2D. Graphics is meh. But, boy, it more than makes up for in gameplay. Another great advantage of the top-down view is its speed. Even with literally tens of thousands of entities it runs so freaking smooth. And it's highly addictive. The well-known \"just one more move\" translates to Factorio's \"let me just finish this setup real quick to step up my production of iron gear wheels\".\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Addictive game play.\n- Ridiculously low price. No microtransactions.\n- Polished. Bugs (almost) not existing.\n- It has trains!\n- It has flying robots that construct stuff for you!\n- It has flying robots that deliver stuff to and from you!\n- Awesome community.\n- Awesome modding community.\n- Indie developers that keep in touch with the community.\n- Bonus: 98% positive reviews. Second highest rating game on Steam. It's dubbed Cracktorio for a reason.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- As of version 0.16 there is no actual end game content.\n- Sleep deprivation.\n\n[b]Recommended sequence:[/b]\n1. Check out and play the free demo.\n2. Buy the game.\n3. Play the campaign as far as you like.\n4. Play vanilla Factorio (i.e. without any mods)\n5. Halfway through realize your factory is not what you wanted it to be.\n6. Restart and build a better factory. Achieve the \"end goal\" by launching a rocket.\n7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 a few times.\n8.

These words may now instantly turn you off a game after buggy games like DayZ or lack of content games like Killing Floor 2 but this game is truly different. Never have I played an early access which is so well polished, bug free and complete that it feels like you aren\u2019t buying an early version of the game, instead you are buying a complete game which will get a load of free DLC.\n\nYou start crash landed on a planet with only a few machines and your mind. You start mining some stone to build more miners but it takes too long, luckily you have a mining drill which will automatically mine for you, great! But you need a way to power it so you mine some coal and power it. But where is it going to be stored? You cut down a few trees to build a chest to place it in and then you got your first set up complete! But one machine will take ages and you got to mine more coal, copper and iron (as well as smelt it) too! After some more mining and tree cutting you have a set-up which will mine all the ores you need. But having to run around and place coal in is inefficient and having 6 different chests for each resource is messy. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a better way!\u201d you say like an infomercial, well there is Kevin! Inserters which will pick up items and place them behind the inserters and conveyer belts which move items. After some fiddling around with this you make a set up which mines everything and stores it into one box. But you still have to power everything with coal, is there a way to improve it? Of course, there always is. This is the basics of the game, you are constantly improving on what you have with the goal of making the factory as efficient and automated as possible.\n\n[list]\n[*]Combat \u2013 Although this seems weird in a factory building game, it is actually implement really well. It keeps you on your toes and limits what you can do. If you focus just on production you aren\u2019t going to be able to fight off an attack which can wipe your factory out, forcing you to start again. You can\u2019t skimp out on any factory or risk losing everything and the more you pollute, the more powerful enemies you will have to face, the more turrets you will have to place.\n\n[*] Weapons & defence \u2013 Fear not, you are also able to craft weapons and armour which will help you fight off enemies. Pistols, Shotguns, Grenades, Mines, even personal defence robots which automatically fire at enemies. But what about defence? Do I just have simple iron and copper armour? Nope, Power Armour! Armour which you can install modules which can increase speed, generate shields, shoot enemies and more. My personal favourite is the roboport which allows you to summon robots who can build blueprints and repair them, allowing me to set up a fortified base in seconds.\n\n[*]Advance & interesting Technology \u2013 Later in the game you unlock more advance and interesting technology, some which allow you to automate object crafting extremely quickly which can further be improved by modules. Robots which can be ordered to supply machines with crafting components so you never have to refill one again or robots which can build entire bases and repair them when they get damaged. Cars, tanks, trains, ways to transport you and supplies around, allowing you to create separate bases with each having a different focus. You are constantly unlocking more and more technology which will make you rethink your entire factory set-up.\n\n[*]Gameplay \u2013 I am constantly put into \u201cthe flow\u201d where I am completely focused which causes time to go by much faster than it feels like. I am constantly fixing one thing only to find out another is broken, restructuring my factory to be more efficient, and fortifying my bases. There is something quite satisfying about having a compact base which just works.\n\n  [*]Multiplayer \u2013 This game features a full multiplayer co-op experience which works flawlessly. The only thing more fun than building a factory by yourself is building it with your mates. 50 hours on one multiplayer game, and we haven\u2019t even modded the game yet!\n[/list]\n\nThis is seriously one of the most interesting games I\u2019ve played on steam, I\u2019ve already got well over my money\u2019s worth and I have no intention of stopping.

However, while those games are quite close to competitive programming or programming interview problems, I would say Factorio is closer to software engineering (and really, all engineering fields) day-to-day job. Here are some few parallels I found in this game:\n\n1. Automate your most tedious tasks so you can focus on more important ones. At the early phase of the game, one of the first things you want to automate is belt production, because you will need tons of it and making it manually will take too much of your precious time. Later when you unlock blueprint and bots, your job become less about placing the individual assemblers, belts and inserters, but more on planning the logistics between large sections of your factory.\n\n2. Choosing between tradeoffs. Making a compact and space-optimized factory means your factory will need less resource and more easily defended, but that means scaling production won't be as easy and planning is quite harder. On the other hand, you can use more extra space for much easier planning and scaling, but that means you need a lot more belts, trains and bots to move around items and you need more defense infrastructure and clear up more biters nests.\n\n3. Tech debts will eat you later if you don't manage it properly. It's easy and tempting to throw some quick design for an assembly line and do some spaghetti belting, but if you do it too much without some structure and refactoring you won't be able to understand your creation tens of hours later.\n\n4. Any big and complex project can be done if you break it down small enough. Getting the blue science production is quite a daunting task when you first start play Factorio. But if you do it piece by piece, starting from the oil processing, then sulfur production, then plastic, and so on, you would eventually finish it.\n\n5. Modularity is king. Modular design is not only good because you can just copy-paste when you need to scale up the production, it is also good because when there is a problem you can easily debug and isolate the root cause.\n\n6. There will never be a perfect design. No matter how much you plan and how beautiful and optimized your designs are, in the end there will still some spaghettis and inefficiencies here and there. And that's totally okay. You need to get it work first, then you can improve and optimize it later.\n\n7. You have your fellow engineers to help you. While I believe it's most fun trying to solve problem with your own ideas first, there are many things I won't be able to discover without the help of many other players in the form of forum, reddit discussion, youtube and twitch playthrough.

Twice.  It really is electronic heroin.  I would tell myself I have to be in bed by midnight, and end up getting to bed at 5am.  Then I would lay in bed for over an hour with my mind BUZZING over how to optimize my train network, or my green-circuit build, or whatever.  I wasn't getting enough sleep, I was getting to work late, and I was distracted throughout the day by still trying to engineer my factory.  I had to stop.  A few months later I slipped back into it, and the cycle essentially repeated.  It's only a matter of time until we start Round Three.\n\nThe game escalates infinitely.  You build as big as you can imagine possible, and then you learn how to imagine bigger.  My first factory, I just wanted to launch a rocket into space.  I built a terrible factory and eventually made it.  After launching the first rocket, how long until I could make a second?  About an hour.  I applied a ton of band-aids to speed it up until the bottleneck of the factory was its very fundamental layout.  So I started a second one, using what I had learned.  This one literally ran an order of magnitude (10x) better, and I find limitations in flow that I hadn't imagined before.  Soon that factory is launching satellites into space on a regular schedule.  I push it further to speed that schedule.  Can I make it to one rocket per minute?  No.  More like every 5 minutes.  Bottlenecked by the core structure of the factory again.  I start a third factory, this one looking more like a small country.  Now I'm building sub-factories, each one every bit as big as Factory #2, just to make one component!  And they're all connected with a complex rail network.  This time the goal is to produce science, and launching rockets into space is just an ingredient!  Putting up one rocket per minute is now just 25% of our production target.  But my rail network, which can EASILY move 10x as much material as my entire previous factory, is STILL inadequate to fully satisfy the demand.  The problem is simple traffic.  The rails are like rush hour.  Trains getting in each others' way.  It cannot be fixed; again the entire fundamental structure of the factory is lacking for the scope of my new vision.  When I quit the game, I had a spreadsheet in which I had calculated the precise amounts of every single component needed, what it needed, and where it was going.  My transportation featured a whole dedicated railroad for EACH component, all networked together like the paths on a circuit board.  My trains were going to move around like ELECTRONS IN A COMPUTER, and the factory would be sending rockets into space like cannons firing artillery.  This monster was going to require 6 to 8 of the nuclear power plants that I had designed.\n\nHalfway through that project, I had a self-intervention and quit the game.  But my Megabase is still sitting on the hard drive, along with the spreadsheets and the network blueprint.  Some time, when I am not distracted by flying in DCS or doing real-world things like riding motorcycles, the addiction will arise again.  Like heroin, a Factorio relapse does not start you back at the beginning.  I know I'll go right back to Megabasing.  But hey, I didn't lose my job last time.

To elevator pitch this one, \"If you can do it, you can automate it.\"\n \nTo describe Factorio by only using games that preceded it feels like an exercise in futility. The concept was born from Minecraft mods, but it feels unfair to compare the two or make the Terraria reference (this, but in 2D). So, taken on its own, Factorio is a game where you play an engineer who is trying to escape the situation they are in by building a rocket. But since the refining and assembling of material components for that sort of thing is unfeasible by yourself, you must build a factory to automate the process. Along the way you must research concepts and upgrades for the planet you are on, mine resources and deal with the locals (in the form of giant insects).\n \nWhat immediately stands out from this game is the sense of progression in scale. Never once in this game will you feel like the game went from comfortably in your reach to an impossible mountain. New technologies are deliberately paced as to never overwhelm the player into building something they do not know what to use for. On top of that the drip feed will have you building whatever is next while researching what comes after that. By the time you might finish expanding your factory to take advantage of something you just researched, you will likely have something new finished and can do it all over again. Rarely does the game come to an immediate halt for either waiting to research or trying to finish building an expansion.\n \nGames should be more accessible to the people who want to play them and Factorio is absolutely excellent in this regard. World generation options are paramount for procedural generation and this game has them in spades. Want to start by landing on more resources than you will probably ever need? Do you like to sit back and relax without dealing with enemies? Do you love trains and want to deal with the logistics of directing them all? Or would you consider yourself a masochist by having scarce resources, more expensive recipes and enemies breathing down your neck from the word go? You can have any of these things in varying states giving you a truly customizable experience any time you want to play.\n \nWith that it is hard to deny the nature of the game feeling like you want to keep going. Not in the live service sort of keep going where you are constantly given daily objectives for a pittance, but in the everything you do unlocks something cool you want to do next. Related to the progression curve, the constant \"I want that!\" organically being available as you play keeps you going long after the game is turned off for the day. The Tetris effect is strong with this game.\n \nDevelopers in games can feel ominously cut off from the players of their games, but Wube software shuns that with regular updates during development, public bug reports and known issues, while having some of the most incredible turnaround times in the business, where a bug could be reported for the first time and fixed for the next release within hours. Provided with that is an official wiki that would make Paradox blush and hiring on mod developers to join the team. All this from less than 30 people.\n \nIf I had a complaint, it is teaching the player. The tutorials are quite good at explaining how to build factories, research, explore, defend yourself and set up a train network. My problem is it does not quite teach the player how to build factories /well/. Concepts like bussing, sub-factories, block design and soforth are pretty well established in the community, but perhaps the founding principles (input:assembler:output ratios, for example) could be better explained to improve efficiency.\n \nTo pick what is the most outstanding for this game it is the community. From what feels like the ether, websites with blueprints and ideas are readily available, online calculators to fix that understanding of ratios (that I mentioned before) and most importantly, the modding community. The game is filled to bursting with mods to do all kinds of things from giving you some items that allow you to start the game sooner and automatic concrete placement to complete overhauls that change the very nature of how you harvest resources and turning enemies into an occasional nuisance to an omnipresent constant threat. There is something for absolutely everyone here, even if you want just the little things, or to extend the game out from a comfortable ~20 hour first rocket to possibly needing hundreds to get there, but it never at all feels like you need to go to a game extender of such challenge.\n \nTo bring this all home, 3,000 hours between the game itself and making my own mods is probably the most entertainment I ever got out of $30. If you think you might like this game, you owe it to yourself to try the demo and decide for yourself.\n \nThe factory must grow.", "timestamp_created": 1612483787, "timestamp_updated": 1612483787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 197, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926344633102416992", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29413433": {"recommendationid": "29413433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063623946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1786, "last_played": 1536459573}, "language": "english", "review": "Price is 20.00 not 19.99 I RESPECT THIS", "timestamp_created": 1485058551, "timestamp_updated": 1485058551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 785, "votes_funny": 426, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926290988922119141", "comment_count": 71, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55645574": {"recommendationid": "55645574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085726833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 46862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9212, "last_played": 1686327697}, "language": "english", "review": "You'll be safer picking up a meth addiction.\n\n10/10 not joking please help me.", "timestamp_created": 1571341084, "timestamp_updated": 1571341084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 204, "votes_funny": 283, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925974488258361816", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42910200": {"recommendationid": "42910200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022700614", "num_games_owned": 1131, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 55164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 11859, "last_played": 1695433327}, "language": "english", "review": "For the love of god, don't buy this game; it's not a game, it's a curse.\n\nSure, it starts out innocent.

Seriously. this is a hard game to put down. \n\nLet's take a typical late game scenario.\n\nAssembler #28, manufacturing Advanced Electronics (let's call it a PCB) has a bottleneck and it's dragging down the entire electronic circuit assembly line.\n\nI took a look at the insertor (a small robotic feeder arm) sitting idle as copper coils were swallowed up by the identical assemblers before it reached #28. Obviously I need to increase copper coil production.\n\nSoo... I took a look at the copper coil assemblers, already sporting a Tech III speed beacon and Tech III efficiency modules and noticed that the copper plate was in short supply.\n\nSooo... I took a look at the copper ore smelting furnaces, also sporting (hard earned) Tech III modules and noticed the selectors feeding those were too slow and were skipping every second ore.\n\nSooo... I upgraded the selectors to fast selectors and solved the problem.\n\nOr did I?\n\n10 minutes later, Assembler #28 is doing it again. I repeat the above mitigation steps and notice the increase in insertor efficiency at the furnaces is depleting the ore feeder line. I have to increase ore production at the mining drills. Obvious right? \n\nSooo... my first thought is to add Tech modules to increase speed but... because the PCB production line is effectively in stasis I can't make more modules just yet so I have to do it the more obvious way. Add a new mining drill. Right?\n\nSooo... I went to get some iron plate BUT... there is none free because it's also being used on the PCB production line. I ran down the conveyor belt, scooping up iron plate, made my mining drill, ran down to the ore fields, installed a power line, placed the drill and.... lost power.\n\nSooo.... While I started to manufacture more panels and accumulators to add more power... the aliens came and with no power on my defenses, it took a superhuman effort to eradicate them using my flamethrower and Power Armor (Mk II of course). My personal construction bots all the while repairing what I damaged with my aggressive flame attack.\n\nMeanwhile.... Because I had stolen the iron plate off the PCB production line the copper coil problem was sorted... at least... temporarily.\n\nThen my sulfuric acid production stopped, which makes my batteries which is used to make my logistic bots that supply the whole higher end production chain... including my research.... because I ran out of..... iron plates.\n\nI'll have to redesign the whole damn thing. Tomorrow. \n\nOr maybe I can just do this little bit now...\n\n..oo00oo..\n\nTo sum it up, the slowish start and slightly difficult-to-get-used-to UI initially only lasts a few minutes. There is plenty of online information to get started but half the fun is working it out for yourself. Within a few hours your plan and the objectives become clear and obvious, \n\nThe best methodology required to achieve those objectives? A whole new matter.\n\nGG\n9/10\n\nNB: As at February 2020, came back to this out of curiosity and have somehow managed to sink another 200+ hours without even realising.

I really needed something new to play, as I got bored with Space Engineers's lack of endgame stuff, and every research I did, factorio ended up showing up.\n\nI saw the reviews on steam. People asking not to buy this game because it's a huge timesink and it ruins lives. I tried not to buy it, I really did. And so I didn't buy it, I downloaded the demo.\n\nHuge mistake. The game is so freaking good that it grabbed my interest just with its demo. I finished the demo and bought it. I told myself \"no, I will control myself. I will do the things I need to do during the week and will only play factorio a few hours each night\". I did the unbelievable achievement of donwloading the full game and then going to bed without playing it. On the next day I managed to do my important, productive stuff, kind of. Then I told myself \"well, I deserve a small break\". That's when it started.\n\nThe game, as some youtube reviewer said, is pure cocaine. You can't simply stop playing, there's always something more to do. It's pure yak shaving: \"Oh crap i'm running out of coal. Better explore to find another coal deposit\". \"Oh shit I need a car for that. Gotta research the automobilism tech\". \"Oh shit for that I need some fancy science packs that I'm still not producing. Gotta get some more furnaces smelting that iron!\" \"Goddamn the biters are attacking my walls again. I need to make an automatic ammo-producing facility so I can auto refill the turrets\" \"Now i'm running out of power. Better make some more steam engines\" \"Ok what was I doing again? Oh yeah the automobilism tech. Ok I just researched it\" \"...For what did I research it, again? Oh yeah to explore and find some more coal deposits\" \"Ok now I found some coal deposit. Wait there's a huge nest next to it. I need to destroy it. But I need some more firepower - I need to research tanks\" \"Ok wait now I need more copper. Gotta make more drills and furnaces.\" \"Well i'm also running out of stone to make the furnaces, gotta improve my stone mine\" and this goes on and on... as I said - pure yak shaving but it's NOT a bad thing, because you feel good doing each and every one of those things - by doing them you're improving your factory and making the game more practical - never have I played a game where my progress could be measured and felt so clearly. This is like the feeling of progress you get from playing those idle games like cookie clicker, but this is so much more fun than idle games, because it has idle game elements but you can manufacture tanks and trains and make huge operations - the \"idle\" part of factorio is that after you start automating things, your factory does everything for you - at the start you're mining coal and iron by hand and placing the manually on furnaces, by mid-late game you have robots that build structures and move items for you, huge facilities that manufacture every kind of item in the game - each with their own destination, most to be manufactured into something else, which will definitely have some kind of use later.\n\nNow, remember when I said I got bored with space engineers because its lack of endgame content? I don't blame the devs, as the game is in early access (just like factorio, by the way), but factorio does something really smart to balance this. The further you move away from your spawn, bigger and more frequent enemy nests will be there. As your factory grows, so does the pollution it emmits: pollution, when it touches a nest, enrages biters and makes them attack your base. More importantly, pollution makes the biters evolve - so the small, early game biter can be killed with the starting pistol, but a behemoth, fully evolved biter, barely loses health to a machine gun turret with piercing ammo. Also, the biters can make new nests - do eventually they will start to overwhelm you, but you will have ways to defend yourself (while also enjoying the game) for a LONG time. Here's how:\n\nIn games where you can automate, farm and manufacture a lot of things like space engineers and minecraft, after you focus enough on creating a basic \"item farming infrastructure\", they become really easy - in SE you can mass manufacture ammo and missiles and fighter ships and drones after you have a basic mining setup, and in minecraft you can farm arrows and make XP grinders to get powerful enchantments and make lots of armor and traps and shape the environment to your benefit. Factorio is the first game i've ever seen of this type where you can of course mass produce weapons and vehicles and ammunition and other stuff, just like in the other games I mentioned, but the hazards evolve as you get more powerful - the amazing game designers behind factorio used a simple concept that we in the game development industry call the flow theory. The flow curve in factorio is nearly perfect: the challenges scale as you get more powerful. Simple as that. In the games I mentioned, space engineers and minecraft, they start really hard (with creatures attacking and hassling you while you're trying to get your basic base setup), but after a while they get super easy - so that is an unbalanced flow curve.\n\nSo to wrap this up, some pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-The game is VERY optimized - you can have a factory with thousands of items moving in conveyor belts, drones, being processed and changed, without it ever stuterring or dropping FPS\n-The map is infinite (you have an option to make it finite)\n-Has a great tutorial (part of it is available on the demo) and a not very steep learning curve\n-Amazing graphics, reminds me of 90's games like Commandos and the first and second Fallout\n-It has freaking CO-OP. Haven't hosted a server yet but I joined a friend's server - no hassle, I just put the i.p and port and bam! I was in!\n-I cannot stress this enough - the game is surprisingly optimized for an early access game, I have yet to find a SINGLE bug or glitch.\n-Not part of the game but for me it counts - the community, (at least on reddit) is very friendly and welcoming. Reminds me of Dwarf Fortress's or Kerbal Space Program's communities.\n-The wiki is really detailed for an early access game - most early access games I play today have really crappy wikis, some with wrong information and subjective statements. \n-And I think one of the most important things is how polished the game is - not just the visuals and core mechanics - if you read the weekly blog posts, you can see that the devs care about not just big features, but small interface and overall user experience details that really help and make the game practical. I've never seen so much care taken into the actual usability of an early access game. These are really small things, that really make a HUGE difference, trust me!\n\nCONS: \nAs everyone keeps saying, this game will destroy your life. I've had it for about three days and have more than 24 hours registered on steam. On my last map, I started playing during the afternoon after programming some stuff. Time passed and I didn't notice - I accidentaly died and on the deathscreen it logged 9 freaking hours. That's when I realize the demonic potential of this game. \nSeriously. As a game developer, I gotta say Wube Software has found a great way to destroy competition -  they can put a stop in the productive life of everyone who plays their game.\n\nIf you have productive things to do, DO NOT BUY IT!

You want to build a rocket that will get you back into space. So you can start by mining some rocks to build a furnace, mining some coal to fuel it, and baking some copper and iron ore into plates. Then you can use them to craft copper wires and iron gears, which can be used to make circuits and machines and buildings. \n\nSimple enough. Pretty standard crafting system for a resource management game. Now you just need to do it another -\n\nWait, what? Five billion times?  Am I reading this right?\n\n[i]Billion?[/i] Are you freaking kidding me?! \n\nYou have to be exaggerating. Those are figurative billions, right?\n\n... No? They're literal billions?\n\n... And those are just your basic wires and gears? You need hundreds of millions of everything else, too? \n\n... Oh. Oh dear. \n\nSounds like we're gonna need to find a better way to get things done.\n\nWhen I describe Factorio to someone, I like to say \"It's a game that plays itself. That's the whole point. But you have to set it up so that it plays itself.\" I also like to say \"It's Stardew Valley if it were made by Zachtronics.\" Indeed, the theme of this game is automation! It requires you to complete projects of ridiculously large scope and long distances, and it's up to you to get your factory to do it for you as efficiently as possible. There are three objects that make up the bread and butter of this game: magical conveyor belts that always run and don't need any sort of power, assembly machines that can craft things for you provided they have the necessary materials, and robotic arms that can grab and pull items to and from buildings, storage boxes, or conveyor belts. Using these main things, you can design a base that crafts stuff for you, and in very large quantites, which then become crafting components for something else, and so on. Before you know it, your base might become very twisty and complex as you're shipping materials around every which way. It's like a visual programming language!\n\nThe tech tree requires you to craft \"science packs\" and insert them into research labs. Each type of science pack can be assembled with some of the most complex items you can craft at the current stage of the game. For instance, the crafting recipe for an early type of science pack is a robotic arm and a piece of conveyor belt. And that's only for one -- you're going to need thousands of science packs to progress to the next stage of the tech tree. But once you do, you can unlock increasingly useful things that can make your factory even more efficient -- like conveyor belts that run underground and allow you to bridge them across one another, railroad systems that can quickly ship resources miles across the map, or flying robots that can carry items through the air, letting you bypass the conveyor system entirely. \n\nBut the biggest mind-blow comes late in the game once you've unlocked the ability to cut, copy, and paste entire configurations of buildings around! And you can also save those configurations to \"blueprint\" objects for later use, or share them online! So if the first half of the game is about avoiding tedium of repetitive tasks using automation, the second half is all about focusing on efficiency, identifying and fixing bottlenecks in your massive production line, expanding the scope of your goals, and designing the perfect blueprints that can be re-used to quickly set up new sections of your ever-growing base.\n\nThere's a reason I compare this game to Stardew Valley. It's addictive. It's [i]damn[/i] addictive. Like real programming, there's unmatched joy in designing something complicated that amazingly [i]works[/i], and it just encourages you to push yourself further and build something even bigger! I've been playing this game for 3 weeks and I've already clocked 100+ hours. Just beating the five tutorial levels took me 10 hours. Beweare, this is a real time sink! But at least it's a time sink that's mentally stimulating and might teach you a thing or two about real-world logistic concepts at the same time!\n\nThe game has a slew of special modes, and even online multiplayer, but I can't say I've tried them -- as of now I'm still immersed by the vanilla experience. The game also has a huge modding community, but I'm not touching mods either until I finish the achievements. So really, 100 hours is just scratching the surface of what you can do in this game.\n\nBut here's my biggest complaint about the game: it's clear that tons of thought went into the tech tree and all the amazing machines you can unlock, but the planet you're stranded on isn't really that interesting. There are only four map biomes: grass, desert, forest, and lake. There are only 4 basic types of ores you use to build everything, and about 8 natural resources total. There are alien bugs, which only come in 3 types, that will periodically attempt to attack your factory, forcing you to research and build military equipment to keep them out. The bugs have some mysterious rules they follow, but once you figure them out, there's nothing else in this game to really explore. There's so much missed potential here for a deep world with more mysterious rules, making it feel like an adventure to explore beyond the boundaries of the known world, rather than a simple workspace that needs decluttering from alien bug nests. The game really needs like 10 more biomes and several more interesting enemy types. (To be fair, there [i]are[/i] tons of community mods that add all sorts of new content, if you're into mods.)\n\nMy other complaint is that the interface is pretty obtuse and has a weird learning curve. I [i]highly[/i] recommend playing the entire 10-hour tutorial to get a hang of things, and make sure you remap your keybinds once you understand how the game works. And to be fair, the game is still in active development as of this writing. It [i]just[/i] got out of Early Access, it's still v1.0.0, with a new patch that comes soon that will apparently add some interface improvements, so hope is not lost.\n\nI'll give this a 9 / 10! I [i]still[/i] can't believe Zachtronics didn't develop this! It's both creatively and intellectually stimulating in all the ways an engineer should appreciate. I'm deeply enjoying my time with the game and I'll miss it when I move on to something else.
