I'll take a guess and say that it probably wasn't something that was meant to be scary, e.g. horror. Rather, it's probably either something that was unintentionally scary or kids' entertainment; something that, at its core, is not horror whatsoever. That's where the purest, most potent fears are created.\n\nIn other words, the best way to create horror is to not create horror. And that's exactly that Omocat did when she made OMORI. A huge, childish, innocent game which [b]seems[/b] to only exist to deliver its true emotional payload with maximum force. \n\nMind, the game doesn't hide the fact that at its very core it is in fact horror. Both the trailer and the screenshots show you glimpses of the darkness that awaits you at the bottom of the staircase. But that's the thing: it [i]awaits[/i]. You know its there, all the while you play a \"normal\" game about a kid hanging out with his friends in a childhood fantasy land for just about long enough to [i]forget[/i]. And then it reminds you of its existence, looks you straight in the eye, and... leaves you alone again. Until you forget again. But your subconsciousness won't forget: it will constantly whisper this dissonant song of quiet anxiety which becomes the background radiation of OMORI's universe.\n\nSo, for the most part you play a kiddy JRPG. But uh-oh, that's also not quite true. To avoid spoilers, let's just say it's not a kid's dream land as much as it's a kid's dream land that's significantly distorted by nostalgia, fading memories and trauma. Remember when I said that this part of the main game [b]seems[/b] only to exist to strengthen the horror? Yes, seems. In the grand scheme of things, it also establishes the world, the characters, the events of the past, and - perhaps most importantly - serves as a snapshot of sorts, snapshot of what the world seemed like back then. You know how that big plushie from your childhood seemed like this lumbering giant, but when you look at the photographs you can see that it was in fact quite small? This is what I'm talking about here.\n\nThis is important because the general theme of the game is \"dealing with your past\" - in more ways than one. But that's all I'm going to say on that topic.\n\nOh, and if you've been playing indie games long enough to believe that games designed by visual artists tend to be pretty but boring, shallow and generally not very thought through, don't you worry. This is a rare exception. The game design is not only fun, it's also quite fresh - for example, instead of elements, the battle system revolves around a mood system. Anger, sadness, happiness. Happiness is strong against anger, anger is strong against sadness, sadness is strong against happiness; many mid-and-late game fights revolve around cleverly managing and exploiting the moods of not only your party, but also the opponents. I've never seen anything like that, and I've seen quite a bit.\n\nIf there's one thing that bothers me about the game, it's the portrayal of some elements of depression. Omori (the character) clearly suffers from some kind of emotional deficiency; not only his face barely changes expressions, he's also drained of colour, unlike literally everything else. So far so good, this is a pretty good representation. But the problem is that in spite of this, he's loved and surrounded by friends. Like, how does that work? Anyone who's suffered from even a minor depressive episode knows that when the \ud835\ude71\ud835\ude7b\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude72\ud835\ude7a \ud835\ude75\ud835\ude7e\ud835\ude76 takes over, people tend to see you as a drag, a bore, uninteresting, and often unattractive due to your lowered ability to care for your looks. Mentally ill people usually end up alone, and not by choice - they're abandoned by their \"friends\" and family. Maybe my experience has something to do with the different way society reacts to depression in men and women; or maybe this is in fact intentional, and this inconsistency is meant to be a clue that something is very wrong here.\n\nThere are other things about this game that I could write about, such as the fact that the soundtrack contains 170+ tracks, 4 hours in total. Or the sheer volume of hand-drawn art this game has. But in such an emotionally potent game as OMORI, these things pretty much don't matter. They're the background, only helping to bring the game's emotionality front and center. If you've decided to descend the staircase of this game, as I believe you should, a small reminder, just in case:\n\nAt the bottom, that darkness is still there.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator Page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1666869616, "timestamp_updated": 1666870066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 245, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928431928157806396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131736024": {"recommendationid": "131736024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062547954", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1540, "last_played": 1674922221}, "language": "english", "review": "i have severe depression \u2764\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1674922633, "timestamp_updated": 1674922633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 263, "votes_funny": 64, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927869617938995361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139344886": {"recommendationid": "139344886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041786609", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2660, "last_played": 1692406717}, "language": "english", "review": "Before I actually played OMORI myself, I heard positive words about it, but at the time, I didn't really want to try it out, due to my laziness, until recently. To be honest, when I was buying this game, I thought I'd just try it out for an hour or two and then not proceed further. How foolish I was back then... on my very first game session, I was stuck in the game for 4 hours straight and liked it, totally not expecting that. The point of no return for me, though, had become the Junkyard area with the track playing in this location, and that's when I literally fell in love with the game.\n\nI managed to finish OMORI within 40+ hours for the first time, while most people finish it within around 20 hours, but it was all about taking my time and sticking nose in every corner I notice, interact with everything that's interactable, and immerse into the story. Actually, everything about this piece of art is brilliant, making it hard for me to talk about anything specific, because all of the aspects of OMORI are intertwined and each of them plays a significant role: gameplay, characters, story, visuals, and, of course, MUSIC (with caps, yes). All combined, I somehow felt nostalgic for something I never really had. I felt familiar with locations as if I was actually there, spending my summer vacations. And characters felt like they're my friends or siblings. This is pure magic.\n\nThis game is one of the prime examples of why story-based games are valuable for players and for the game industry overall. They are unlike online session or grinding kind of games, in which you can spend hundreds or thousands of hours. It's not necessarily a bad thing, to spend that much time for a game, but something story-based, which might not even take 50 hours to finish, can end up being much more memorable and make you feel alive, refreshing from routine, carry you through a roller coaster of emotions, ending with a thought \"What a blast it has been\". In case of OMORI, you'll additionally have so much to think about afterwards, look up at discussion forums, come up with certain ideas. And most likely, tear up or cry. Fun fact: no piece of media has ever drained so many tears from me, even though I wasn't ugly crying, haha.\n\nA couple of important parts about the game: it DOES contain psyschological horror elements, it covers quite sensitive topics and it demonstrates some things which might be hard to take for certain players, be advised about it. And, if you decided to play this game or started playing it and you're determined to finish it, try to avoid spoilers. It is important.\n\nThis is the first time I'm writing an actual review for a game, I really don't have expreience in writing those :p But I got this inspiration to deliver my feelings and some points about OMORI, as it felt important to me. Maybe I really needed to get through such expreience for a long time, and I hadn't even known about it, until recently.\n\nFor anyone who reads this, thank you for your time!", "timestamp_created":

The writing I did has only one goal: to make a conclusion of my own thoughts and emotions that came up in my mind throughout playing this game.\n\nI came to Omori as a normal, mentally stable fellow, without that many sad and depressing thoughts before playing. I consider myself a person who will never complain to somebody about my emotions and thoughts. I'll never cry to anyone and will never say how bad I'm feeling; that's okay for me. I never had depression and expected nothing from this game. A month ago, I decided to finally quit video games because of the intensive studies that are going to begin this September. I'll have to move to a completely new country for me, alone. I will work hard, and there is no way I could spend my free time in front of a computer. I considered Omori as my last single-player video game of my teenage years and for the foreseeable future.\n\nMy first play was at night. Being completely alone helped me understand this game correctly. My first session lasted for six non-stop hours, and I've never felt what I felt during this play. There is no other video game that is able to make you feel that blank post-gaming syndrome constantly, like Omori did. I felt it from the beginning until the end, whether I was in front of a computer or not. I'm still wondering if this \"hollow\" feeling will ever fully leave me. When I decided that this is enough for today, I went to the bathroom and spent almost an hour there, thinking. The main subject was my childhood.\n\nThe thoughts of my childhood became a sad ghost that follows me every night and day. I think about it every time I have to solve some task about my university admission or studies, every time I walk through a place that was special only for you and a few people you knew back then. Do they still remember it as I do? Do they still cherish it as I do? Will they ever come back here with a desperate hope of seeing some of us or just to see it again?\n\nThat night, I felt completely miserable. There is no way to get back there. There is no way I could ever talk to all my good old friends again, no way we could gather again and do the things that kids like us usually did. Some part of them is lost in a big city with their own troubles. I'm sure that they have forgotten how great it was together. Some have left the country forever, and some are even dead. Money wasn't a concern in my childhood. There was no war, and I wasn't afraid that I'd never see my parents again due to a Russian rocket attack. When I was 12, my only worry was spending another summer with my friends, with a stash of snacks prohibited by my mother, and that limited version of Coca-Cola that is no longer produced. I never thought about all of this before playing OMORI. I never missed my childhood times and never dreamed about those times. Omori's headspace is a mirror of our infantile times we all had and miss.\n\nThis masterpiece is not about gameplay, graphics, or storyline. There is no way you can rate it separately from your own mind and the changes that occur in it during the play. This game is about nostalgic, infantile, pure emotions that emerge from the hidden part of your soul and will never leave you until your death.\n\nThere is a theory of the \"last dream,\" which means that when you die, your brain will produce a last, long dream\u2014some even call it heaven. I am sure that this \"heaven\" will be some kind of headspace, but with your own friends, games, and troubles. I hope that I'll be able to feel these emotions of a little kid who just minds his own business, playing games with friends and dreaming again. Wait for me, my friends.

From the beginning sections of the game, I found myself emotionally invested in the characters and story to a degree that I have never experienced before. From my initial impressions, Omori managed to retain this level of investment throughout my 32-hour playthrough. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide insight into the story for fear of spoiling you of the experience. I went in completely blind without reading any online reviews (some of which mention key story beats), so I suggest you do the same. What I can reveal, is the game features prominent themes of depression, suicide, and guilt, and these themes are core to the story Omori is telling. \n\nOmori\u2019s main gameplay loop centres around a top-down perspective when exploring the overworld, and a JRPG turn-based battle system that focuses on controlling four party members, each with their own stats and abilities. Unlike other JRPG\u2019s however, Omori chooses to ditch elemental status effects (e.g Stun, Sleep, Frozen) and implements a system centred around emotion. Each character is able to be happy, sad, or angry, and each emotion comes with their stat changes, along with their own strengths and weaknesses. \n\nOutside of encounters, players explore a beautiful pixel-art world full of colour, mystery and intrigue. Each location in the game is unique, and no two areas feel repetitive or instil a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The world is littered with a good variety of side quests, which I recommend you do \u2013 not only to receive the items/gear as rewards for completion, but also to experience the heart-warming stories the side quests are able to convey. Few games can make side content worth doing, more often than not these missions feel as though they are only present to pad out the games\u2019 run time, however Omori manages to make these missions a meaningful addition that can be a nice change of pace from the game\u2019s dark narrative. \n\nOmori\u2019s soundtrack perfectly complements the game\u2019s central themes. Some tracks are whimsical and upbeat, while others incite a feeling of hopelessness and dread within the player, and each track is masterfully utilized to enhance the emotions the game is trying to convey within its story beats and exploration. Each track has a purpose and emotion tied to it, and multiple genres of music are featured, ranging from retro to orchestral. \n\nIn conclusion, Omori is a meticulously crafted experience that tells an engaging story and leaves a major impact upon the player. All of the aspects of the game are so important to the story telling and emotional palpability of the world, and they meld together seamlessly. This game was an emotional rollercoaster, with many ups and downs which left me in equal parts smiling through the lighter tones of the story, and dejected at the more depressing content. I loved this game, and I hope you enjoy this experience as much as I did. \n", "timestamp_created": 1690097655, "timestamp_updated": 1690097655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 0,

It is not a good game.\n\nIt is FREAKING PHENOMENAL!\n\nI loved it so much that I bought it here just to spread the word. (OK, that's a lie. I bought it because I know I'll play it again. And again. And again. :D )\n\nSeriously, do yourself a favor and don't look up anything about this game. Don't spoil yourself with reviews (Oh! The irony!), comments, or any videos. Just buy it and play it.\n\nSometimes I think I'm too old for video games( :D), or they are getting stale, but thank goodness for games like Omori that remind me why I enjoy them so much.",

The game portrays concepts such as anxiety, depression, trauma and suicide. If you\u2019re looking for an adventure game to pass the time and you\u2019re not easily triggered I highly recommend this game.\n\nThe player assumes the role of a teenage boy whose alter-ego is called \u2018Omori\u2019. The game is more or less split into halves, in two different settings, Headspace and Faraway Town. In simple terms, Headspace is essentially Omori\u2019s escape from reality. The two polarizing visual settings are improved upon, by the soundscape being that of juxtaposition as well, reinforcing the mood!\n\nThe plot of this game is elaborate and is expanded upon throughout the lengthy gameplay. Despite its length the game never feels boring due to the elaborate, colorful, expansive and polarizing score. The music has great success in making the player feel immersed in the dream world, Headspace, at all times; it is able to relay darker and more sinister tones when necessary. \n\nThe first sound cue \u2018Titel\u2019 is played whenever we load the game. The music sounds empty, there is a continual, soft white noise under a solitary piano making it sound sparse. This white noise is not in the same key as the piano making it dissonant, adding to the feeling that something is wrong.   \n\nThe Piano sounds cold in this particular setting as the instrument has no vibrato, the melody is discordant and we are in a minor key. There is a lack of any richness, denying the listener, all hope from this passage of music. The notes are also disjunct, making them unpredictable and unsettling. To further this atmosphere, the cue contains no perfect cadences, the music cannot resolve, perhaps relating to how the characters in the game cannot resolve their emotions and/or traumatic experiences they've endured.\n\nThe game talks about the importance of friends and family, being there for one another. The tune is played on the left hand and the lower chords, that reinforce that melody, are in the right hand. The right hand could represent Mari, Omori\u2019s older sister, while the lost-sounding melody represents Omori.\n\nThe next cue we will be looking at is called \u2018White Space\u2019. This cue plays when we are present in White Space, which occurs often. White space appears in contrast to the rest of the game as it is an abstract plain, devoid of all colour and life. We travel to white space usually after a traumatic event in the game. The cue is simple and effective, as the short repetitive musical patterns work in tandem with the stark atmosphere of the white setting. The use of an electronic synth works well with the striking white visuals and the computer found in white space. The melody\u2019s pattern is descending but ends on a note that is higher than the first, making for an ambiguous melody line. This pattern plays twice in a major key and twice in the minor key. This gives the player a sense of unease knowing that despite our isolation, we are not safe. The descending patterns and minor key sound alarming. In contrast, the high note at the end of phrases and major sections sounds positive. Overall, this bit of music leaves us in suspense.\n\nThe last cue we will be looking at plays in the dreamland, Headspace, and is titled \u2018Three Bar Logos\u2019. It is a memorable, light-hearted, heroic piece of music. This music plays as you fight off \u2018baddies\u2019 in Headspace. The heroic melody is created by the intervals that sound reassured and are whole-tonal. The cue is polyrhythmic and frantic, making it sound like a fight. The main tune is then punctuated by a rhythmically augmented syncopation, they are short punch-like sounds, ideal for the fight element of this game.\n\nOverall, the music enriches the player's understanding of this already plot-rich game. It also helps enhance all elements of the game, whether it\u2019s setting pace, combat segments, and emotional or pinnacle hit points in the game. It\u2019s a musical rhapsody full of colour and excitement as well as masterful horror elements and suspense. \n", "timestamp_created": 1692474181, "timestamp_updated": 1692474181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820412993431091309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140943764": {"recommendationid": "140943764", "author": {"steamid": "76561199384440166", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 12109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 2818, "last_played": 1695429611}, "language": "english", "review": "there are feeet picutres foot ttoe", "timestamp_created": 1688091822, "timestamp_updated": 1689273501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819397687911987305", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139036459": {"recommendationid": "139036459", "author": {"steamid": "76561199435346517", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4094, "last_played": 1681217115}, "language": "english", "review": "mewo.\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \uff3f\uff3f\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\u4e8c\u3064", "timestamp_created": 1685126470, "timestamp_updated": 1685126470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819084405899047852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128332132": {"recommendationid": "128332132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185760790", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2830, "last_played": 1670853456}, "language": "english", "review": "A powerful story-rich game that almost made me cry. The horror element is more passive than active, similar to jumpscares in horror games. The game's uneasy and anxious atmosphere in one section and the cute and lighthearted segments contrast nicely with how the story is presented in the other. The little secrets and hidden easter eggs make the world feel more natural and ready to pique our interest in the world we are presented with. Omori is like climbing a mountain, reaching the peak, and then immediately climbing a bigger mountain. Sure, climbing the mountain is a big part of the fun, but sometimes you just want to sit back and take in the scenery. To see this masterpiece, you'll have to play it yourself. I went in blind, and it was the best experience of my life, aside from the severe depression I suffered. Overall, Omori is a fantastic and impactful game that I believe everyone should play, but be prepared for its excruciating pacing. I rate it 10/10.

I avoided the content and tried not to say anything as you never know whats going on behind the scenes, but at this point it's fair to say that it's likely never coming and Omocat cucked those who supported her and her game.\nIf you want to play this game, either play it on a console or get it on Xbox gamepass. You dont just miss out on a little content playing on steam, you miss out on a lot, specifically in one of the games main alternate routes. If steam is your only option i would still recommend just biting the bullet and playing it on steam as the game is amazing with or without the new content and worth experiencing, but if you have the other options take them 100%. The fact that this game hasn't had a price gouge on steam since this whole new content controversy happened is also disgusting.\nI could go on a whole rant about how Omocat doesn't give a fuck about those who originally supported her and just wants to milk those who enjoy the game for every penny but i wont, if you're curious i recommend looking into her long list of controversies yourself (basically everything with the original kickstarter for the game), others have explained it far better than i can. I love this game and it truly pisses me off how horribly it has been handled for all these years by Omocat.\nIf by some miracle the new content does come out i'll change my review, by as of now naw.", "timestamp_created": 1667900600, "timestamp_updated": 1667905874, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74787449836730957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129131339": {"recommendationid": "129131339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049128427", "num_games_owned": 735, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2834, "last_played": 1673200810}, "language": "english", "review": "IM NOT CRYING!\n\nYOU'RE CRYING!", "timestamp_created": 1671838858, "timestamp_updated": 1671838858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746562659740447998", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138240379": {"recommendationid": "138240379", "author": {"steamid": "76561199238933324", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1190, "last_played": 1685748775}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a beautiful masterpiece, truly a work of art.", "timestamp_created": 1683989856, "timestamp_updated": 1683989856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742473304271697998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139350412": {"recommendationid": "139350412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803744788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 677, "last_played": 1685586688}, "language": "english", "review": "geat", "timestamp_created": 1685586706, "timestamp_updated": 1685586706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739152073860168457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129273415": {"recommendationid": "129273415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372460713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3114, "last_played": 1672760718}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first played the game, I got to the [spoiler]Pluto (Expanded)[/spoiler] and the my laptop blue screened so I lost all progress...

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 94 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching The Hub. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he sat next to me whilst explaining. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The game's ambiance can also bring you a perfect kind of suspense and psychological horror that makes you feel pretty much curious to discover what's going on in the protagonist's mind and the entire game's well-written story. Trust me, try to play the game as blind as possible and see for yourself how interesting this experience can be.[h1] The gameplay and its weird world [/h1]Although inspired by the Mother series, its turn-based combat is extremely unique in lots of ways and pretty fun once you get fully used to it, with lots of different skills to equip and experiment with its odd yet exciting combat. The world is full of interesting NPCs and stuff to do as well as side quests with rewards that can help you engage against more powerful foes, making the exploration very satisfactory, fulfilling you with funny and weird dialogues from certain NPCs that come across your way.[h1] The amazing official soundtrack [/h1]The soundtrack is extremely well-made and astonishing to listen to, with each area having a unique battle theme and making you feel excited to fight your enemies.

I heard its praise but oddly none of its negatives which tells me something isn't being told. \n\nOMORI is a story where u are a young man who appears in a colorful world but lacks color himself for some reason. Over the course of the game you will learn that not everything is what it seems and the truth can be something hard to accept. So with that lets get on with the review.\n\nWARNING - LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD I WILL SAY WHEN THE SPOILERS ARE OVER IF U WISHED TO AVOID THEM.\n\nThe story:\n[spoiler]OMORI story tackles a number of themes a lot of games avoid. Personally depression in young people, self harm and the thoughts of ending one's life. The game cleverly hides this from the player at the start by dropping us in a colorful world which everything seems happy, tho even then we get hints something isn't right. The choice of using a young teen as our protag is great as it allows many people both teens themselves or adults to understand the feelings our protag is going though. The use of making our in game colors black and white compare to everything else is also meant to give u a feel something off. Another thing of praise is how it handles each theme without feeling like it not been given careful thought on how to portray it. However the game does a number of endings which while nice, playing the game though a number of times  to get these endings, you never get the same feeling the first run gives as it does a good job at keeping the player in the dark until the right time to reveal important plot/story. This however is why i bring up the number of endings, see once you know the mystery the game kind of loses a lot in the terms of storytelling as the game rely on the player not knowing to always keeping the player on their toes. Lastly is some of the endings are hard to figure out as the game sometimes flat out fails to give the info to point the in the right place to get those endings, however the game does give a hint early on on how to get the true ending tho it doesn't make it too easy to notice.[/spoiler] \n\nTHE SPOILERS ARE OVER\n\nGameplay:\nOMORI plays a old school RPG or if people played the mother games (Earthbound in the west) then you feel right at home. Combat works on a turn based system where u do all our characters moves which then play out which allows you to set up a number of combats and strats. Grinding is kind as the game doesn't need much to beat it and each boss fight feels different and enjoyable. There is a fast travel system which only at select times which can't be used to get around the world. Lastly each party member covers a job which u normally find in RPGs. You have a Damage dealer, your tank, your healer and your support/debuffer. I would talk more about Game play but the game does a good job explaining these to you which i feel i would just be rehashing as most of it is explained to you in the first hour of the game. \n\nArt/sound:\nOMORI boasts a lovely art style which feels like you looking at a young person's drawings and each character and foe looks great. While the game has no voice acting, the game covers that by the wide array of sound effects and music. Speaking of the Music the OST is honest one of the best i heard in a while where each area and main bosses have their own song which are all great to listen to as they go from the calm and peaceful to the dark while bosses ost's feel like a epic fight or fitting for the boss in question. Last detail is focus on our main cast as each of them have a number of expressions which are well illustrated and really brings each one to life. Even a number of NPCs even have a wide number of expressions each look great. \n\nConclusion:\nOMORI is a game where i personally feel a lot of people can relate and connect with. While some of its themes can be unsettling to some, the devs have done a wonderful job at making sure they give each one the careful thought which is needed to use them. If you not a fan of turn based game play i would avoid the game because a good part of the game is combat and some areas can last awhile. With all that i would recommend OMORI as for the price of \u00a316 at the time of review you will get value for your money and experience a story which feels well written and even can put a number of AAA games to shame.", "timestamp_created": 1692627656, "timestamp_updated": 1692724216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697920739650726318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129136699": {"recommendationid": "129136699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259080170", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 996, "last_played": 1688712207}, "language": "english", "review": "basil is my child", "timestamp_created": 1671845678, "timestamp_updated": 1671845678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696955323219299316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132194686": {"recommendationid": "132194686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198894206362", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2113, "last_played": 1668012186}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, I didn't expect it to hit like that..! This review will be purely my personal comments as the game affects me emotionally. If my memory does not deceive me, I think it is the only game that I have been most emotional while playing so far. Fun, happiness, fear, trauma, etc. The transition between the concepts is made in such a comfortable and impressive way that it is impossible not to be impressed. The game really managed to make me question my own life, which I mean in a good way. I think I experienced this game with perfect timing and it literally gave me a helping hand out of all the things and emotional breakdowns that have been going on in my life. On top of that, it made me remember and take care of many values that I had forgotten about life. However, even with such a beautifully and strikingly written script, there were many illogical and difficult things to ignore in my mind. I'm not going to spoil the surprise by talking about these, I want you to experience it for yourself.

[/b]\n[b] In the language of flowers, it symbolizes the phrase\u2026 [/b]\n[b] \"My thoughts will follow you into your dreams.\u201d [/b]\n[hr][/hr]\nAugust 26, 2023, a night of indelible memories and a dawn that shall forever remain unexpunged from the corridors of my mind, accentuated by the mellifluous serenade of birdsong outside my window, juxtaposed against the ineffable tears tracing their paths down my visage. On this date, I completed [b] OMORI [/b] for the first time.\n\n[b] This game, profoundly, embraced my soul. [/b]\n\nI pen down these words while reflecting upon each nook and cranny of my soul that [b] OMORI [/b] has touched, gently yet unabashedly. The fingers that grace my keyboard now are the very ones that aspire to caress the melodies of \"Duet\" on the most delicate of pianos and violins. Even though my vision is blurred by tears that could form rivers, never before have I perceived with greater clarity the message this game aims to convey, in the most exquisite manner I have ever witnessed.\n\nThe beauty intrinsic to this game is a concept that eludes my capacity for expression, given the deeply personal and intricate impact it has evoked within me. The most intriguing fact is that, on a personal note, I've always been passionate about writing. However, [b] OMORI [/b] has proven to me that words often fall short in capturing such significant moments. In addition, an enduring passion of mine has perpetually been photography, owing to the profound ability it confers upon us to encapsulate moments within the unfathomable expanse of time. In the pulchritudinous universe of [b] OMORI, [/b] however, the art of photography beckoned me into a cycle of unbroken introspection before my mirror, compelling me to inquire into the very essence of my emotions and thoughts.\n\n[b] OMORI [/b] prompted me to revisit a vital query pertaining to the continuity of our existence concerning what we can express, in its raw and unadulterated form, as human beings: \n\n[b] What constitutes art? [/b]\n\nArt, that effervescent alchemy of the human spirit, stands as the purest manifestation of our pursuit of transcendence. It does not merely interlace pigments or sculpt forms; rather, it is the language of the soul, unveiling the concealed mysteries of our inner world.\n\nIn [b] OMORI, [/b] as exemplified by the duality between Headspace and Faraway Town, art in the form of expression confronts us with reality and dreams, often concurrently. It presents the hues of the heart and the nuances of our deepest aspirations. Every brushstroke, every note, every line traced is a glimpse of our being, an invitation to delve into the mosaic of human emotions.\n\nThrough this art, we embark upon realms that elude the grasp of time. The creations are not mere artifacts; rather, they are gateways ushering us into realms of contemplation and connection. The dance of colors on a canvas, the evocative melody of a song (The notes of [b] OMORI's [/b] soundtrack reside eternally in my heart as evidence of immortality), the silent narrative of a sculpture \u2014 all these are intimate dialogues, resonating with the echoes of our innermost thoughts.\n\nIn the most profoundly personal sense, [b] OMORI [/b] has been, is, and will continue to be a journey of self-discovery, an introspection that surpasses the superficial and delves into the depths. Art unveils layers of our psyche that often lie unexplored. It challenges us to confront our fears, our hopes, our emotional scars. And, in doing so, it aids us in embracing and comprehending our very [i] humanity. [/i]\n\n[b] OMORI [/b] has taught me that art is the poetry of our existence, translating the nuances of life into forms that elude the limitations of language. It enables us to scream in silence, to smile with tears in our eyes, and to dance on the wings of imagination. In every stroke, there is a sigh; in every hue, an echo of the heart. It is the dance of life and soul intertwined, a testament that we are more than flesh and bone - we are the very essence of expression.\n\nThis game has not solely imparted to me insights into the resplendent concept of art through my personal interpretation and experience, but has also become a haven for an inquiry that arises as a contemplative quandary for all individuals who dare to cast a fleeting glance upon that which, in its profound essence, finds refuge within our souls: \n\n[b] What truly defines love? [/b]\n\nThe response pertaining to the aforementioned subject guides us towards an answer that intertwines with a question: \n\nCan [b] art [/b] truly encapsulate the essence of [b] love [/b] within its definition?\n\n[b] Love [/b] embodies [i] forgiveness. [/i]\n[b] Love [/b] embodies [i] hope. [/i]\n\nIf, by means of simple words, we are able to encapsulate the expansiveness of this concept, then in culmination, I write:\n\n[b] OMORI [/b] is an art form.\n[b] OMORI [/b] is a manifestation of love (hope).\n[b] OMORI [/b] is the embodiment of the artistry of learning to love and forgive oneself.\n\nThis game is a fragment of my love.\nIf you, specifically you who knows that you are you, are reading this, I hope you always find the significance beyond the lexicality of \"less than\" to \"hash\".\n\nIf you, reader, have perused this review, which has functioned as an endeavor to articulate an array of ruminations and sentiments dwelling within my soul through the conduit of writing, until its ultimate culmination, my aspiration is that it has stirred a resonance within you.\n\nIf you find yourself adequately poised for this, play [b] OMORI. [/b]\n[b] P.S. [/b] However, I want it to be clear that this game is [b] not [/b] for everyone; it is exceptionally unique in how it addresses sensitive subjects.\n\nIn the event that your decision leads you to embark upon this experience:\nI sincerely hope you uncover the depth of conceptualizing your own unique [i] humanity [/i] throughout this game, one that has reached the depths of my soul in a manner beyond adequate articulation, I aspire for it to similarly resonate with your own being.\n\nThe technical lexicon of a meticulous analysis of this game can never truly equate to its abstraction. \nWords would never suffice, regardless of the allowed character limit.\n\nNo game has been, is or ever will be like [b] OMORI. [/b]\n\nRemember, we do not transcend our fears by obliterating them, but by embracing them in coexistence. We must acquire the art of self-forgiveness and extend that forgiveness to the world that surrounds us.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2639288871\n\n[h1] OMORI will not succumb.

It explores the safe haven you created for yourself. You constantly think back to your childhood, to the simpler times where things didn't matter, nothing weighed on you heavily, and time with your friends felt like it would never end. And yet... the play ends, the curtains fall, and you wake up isolated from everything you've ever come to know and love. You have choices to make. Will you be able to make the choices to discover your true reality?\n\nOmori's story shows how the main character deals with the stress of all his fears. Visiting this safe haven, headspace, shows what the main character holds onto dearly. And yet, the cheerful and colorful backdrops of the world are all a facade to fuel your extreme escapism. The deeper you go into the story, the more you'll realize that life is unfair. That losing something important to you is just the first domino to fall, which cascades into everything around you changing, whether you like it or not.

It's perfect if you waltz in blind.\n\nNo, it's not Undertale.\n\nIt's a generally well-written game with a quite likeable cast, making you feel bad for said cast (which it does pretty well at a few points), room for interpretation and discussion, nice art, good music, interesting-ish plot, pretty high attention to detail, leitmotifs that count as detail, foreshadowing, and memorable-to-excellent events of a variety.\nYou could wish that you could wipe your memory and play it again, and... well, at-least i did.\n\nThe large amounts of good is dulled and dented by mistakes, missed opportunities, and things that could have been improved on from the devs side, one of the more apparent issues being the *slow* beginning the game has, along with non-excellent pacing on some parts, which causes people to say that the entire game feels like a slog (which varies from person to person). I didn't really notice that too well, aside from minor annoyance in some parts.\n\nShouldn't forget about the issues that rise if you aren't bent towards what the game wants you to feel.\nThough, as you somehow will not notice any issues at first, you'll be fine as long as you don't think about them, because there is stuff to awe over. As i said, the game's a ride, at-least on a first run.\n\nIgnoring the last (negative) part, it's certainly one of the better games that i have played recently, maybe ever. The positive traits make up a great game, which... well, obviously has something to do with the Overwhelmingly Positive ratings and some people describing it to be life-changing. I don't know if the game is \"lighting caught in a bottle\", but some feel like it is. The negative traits or issues don't ruin it, but you can easily have an issue with them. \n\nThere's a reason that i kind of had an obsession with the game (Or \"brainrot\"), as have other people, despite the list of things that i disliked. Still, some of those things will only become problematic once you have finished the game once, and i won't actually mention them, because, in-case somebody actually reads this, their experience could be tainted.\n\n\n\nAnd... that's it. Feel free to ask questions, as the comments are not locked.\nMaybe look at the other positive reviews of the game if you want to, though, they are *far* more positive.

OMORI is still my 2nd favorite game of all time. This is some very tough love!) To start, I still recommend this game, but it is not for everyone.\n\nTo put it bluntly, this game is long. Super long. The average playtime to finish this game is 20 hours, and most of that time is not spent progressing the plot. It\u2019s spent doing endless fetch quests, roaming around, fighting hordes of enemies, and reading so much dialogue that it can put some people to sleep.\t \n\nHEAD SPACE: While I could write about every single part of the game, and critique how it could\u2019ve been better, the entire rest of head space is essentially the same thing and so boring it can be summarized in a few paragraphs. Basically, you spend about 90% of your playtime in head space where the plot does not move forward. You just do a bunch of boring, pointless side quests that take forever. \nYou do puzzles that are painfully easy. You fight billions of the same enemy, and most of the time turn your brain off and just spam the attack button, and this isn\u2019t even scratching the surface on how boring head space is. It got to the point that it took me a month and 13 days to finish this game because I kept taking breaks after enduring this slog fest. \nThis whole thing combined leads to a repetitive cycle where you trudge through headspace hoping to reach the point where the plot progresses and you enter the real world, which usually only occurs at the end of each segment of head space. So you get a quick spooky event about the \u201ctruth,\u201d then get sent to the real world.\n\nTHE REAL WORLD: The real world consists of a few fetch quests and missions, and has some of the main problems from before. The best thing though is that it actually moves the central plot forward, and isn\u2019t entirely pointless in the grand scheme of things. However the main problem with the real world is that there are so many moments of character development that should be mandatory, such as the description KEL gives about HERO\u2019s depression when you interact with the Gravestone. I didn\u2019t even know about this in my playthrough, and it's a pretty big plot point that should be expressed.\n\nI\u2019d also like to elaborate on the combat for a moment. The combat system with emotions is unique, but rarely utilized. Even if you wanted to use it for yourself you have 4 party members whose emotions need to be turned. That means 4 turns of using \u201cCheer,\u201d or \u201cSad Poem,\u201d or \u201cAnnoy,\u201d (Plus an extra turn if the enemy\u2019s emotion needs to be changed) In these 4 turns, you could deal so much damage, or be dealt so much damage that it becomes entirely pointless. (And yes, I am aware of the items that make your entire party or foes a specific emotion, but those are later in the game and are classified as items, so they are meant to be single use and \u201cpowerful.\u201d)\n\nFinally, the main part of the game that even kept me playing: The story and writing. To start, the game is very cheesy when it comes to its characters. I thought that this would be isolated to head space alone, but no, it carries over to the real world. Since the writing style stays the same, and none of the teenagers speak like teenagers (They rarely curse at all. This game talks about suicide, so the game can handle curse words. Curse words are usually the best way to separate fantasy from reality because yes, people do curse in stressful situations and it helps emphasize the importance of the situation), the game ends up being pretty unrealistic and feels like you're reading a manga, not seeing an actual friend group going through a hard time.\nA good example of this is AUBREY. In about 3 days, after seeing SUNNY fully basically for the first time since MARI\u2019s death, and going through various mental breakdowns, AUBREY goes through the classic Family Guy \u201cAw geez, I\u2019ve been a real jerk,\u201d then makes up with the entire party of friends. So you're telling me a person who held a grudge against their prior beloved friend group for years, to the point of which doing physical harm to them would just lose that grudge in days? Yeah, okay.\n\nThis game also terribly conveys depression. Suicide is a game mechanic, for some fucking reason, which is so insensitive and strange. The bad ending of the game also is just SUNNY killing himself with a (banger) song playing, which is just edgy and unnecessary. These moments seem to be just there for shock value, nothing more.\nThe game wants to convey that SUNNY has depression, but instead shows that SUNNY is scared of spiders, heights, and swimming, and does not want to go outside. So basically SUNNY just has a bunch of phobias, and is extremely fucking guilty because of the twist (more on that in a moment). \nSUNNY is also never smiling, ever. Which is strange, because most stories about suicide (with personal experience here, too) are shocking to surrounding friends and family because the person who committed suicide never seemed to express being depressed, or them in a state where they\u2019d want to commit suicide\nBut OMOCAT has a very 1 dimensional view of depression. The game portrays people who are depressed as \u201cDepressed people are sad. They never smile. They commit suicide,\u201d when it is far more complex than that.\n\nNow, coming to possibly the worst part of this game, the twist ending. We learn that SUNNY and BASIL killed MARI by pushing her down the stairs, then framing it as a suicide. So everything prior, SUNNY and BASIL\u2019s \u201cdepression,\u201d it's not depression. It's guilt. MARI was never suicidal, she was killed. Which essentially means that what could\u2019ve been an interesting take on depression (as MARI was always so happy and vibrant) is destroyed by the fact that she never committed suicide and that it was framed. So all portrayals of depression in this game are fucking stupid and do not compare at all to the real world.\n\nAlso, the twist makes no fucking sense. So MARI gets pushed by SUNNY down the stairs. Then she falls on a fragmented violin. If she wasn\u2019t bleeding before, she is now. Then, SUNNY drags her bloodied corpse back up the stairs, and lays her in her bed. So now there is blood everywhere across the house. Then, SUNNY and BASIL take her body (which is still dripping blood everywhere) to a tree, hoist up her 15 year old body with 12 year old noodle limbs, and then proceed to tie a noose around her head (which is harder than it looks.) \n\nThen the police had to either:\nA: Be extremely stupid and not notice the violin shards in the body.\nB: Not to be called, and the murder scene covered up by the parents. Also, we have to assume that SUNNY\u2019s mother did this on her own, because the father presumably left SUNNY because of this incident. Leaving your entire family is a big thing, and it would make no sense for the father to cover up the murder and then leave. He would most likely keep the murder to himself, but leave in disgust.\n\nThen the game portrays SUNNY and BASIL as sympathetic and innocent. Are you fucking kidding me? The plan to cover it up as a suicide is ridiculous enough for 12 year old \u201cinnocent boys,\u201d but even if they did come up with this plan, the adrenaline rush to cover it up would\u2019ve been long gone after SUNNY put MARI back in her bed.\nThis would be actually very interesting if the story was more of a \u201cwho-dun-it,\u201d and we were watching psychopaths coming up with their plan, but instead we\u2019re supposed to be watching innocent boys who made a mistake and are supposed to be forgiven and tell the truth. Yeah right.\n\nThe thing is, there was even no need for this twist ending. I understand how subjective it may be, and you can fight tooth and nail claiming that \u201cThe ending is believable, it's about being honest with yourself, etc.\u201d But if the game really wanted to dive into depression, it could\u2019ve instead explored the very real situation of a person who appears to be happy and vibrant committing suicide. Instead we have a twist ending more because of \u201cshock\u201d than because of telling a good emotional story.\n", "timestamp_created": 1691032662, "timestamp_updated": 1691708660, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607493340969085693", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141829691": {"recommendationid": "141829691", "author": {"steamid": "76561199297150945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1109, "last_played": 1689080136}, "language": "english", "review": "+very good characters, I pretty much liked the entire main cast + some side characters.\n+fun battle system with it's emotion system.

Are you a fan of JRPG/RPG genre? Have you ever wanted a game to make you cry? If you said yes to all three of these questions, look no further, you found a perfect game for you - Omori. [b][u]UNLESS[/u][/b] you are depressed and/or suicidal, then maybe you should play it another time, because this piece of multimedia won't do any good to your condition or it may even worsen it.\n\nI played this game via family sharing but as soon as I finished it I bought the game to support the creators, and also, among other things, to write this review. That's how great the game is and deservedly so.\n\n\nOmori is a RPG psychological horror with turn-based combat. You take control of the same named character, in a seemingly strange place called White Space, in which the only colors are black and white. You are all alone, with a few items next to you - a laptop, a sketchbook, a box of tissues and a black cat. Above you there is a a light bulb which is pitch black inside. This very setting of the game should give you at least a glimpse about the tone and what you should expect from this game. You exit through the door and meet your 4 best friends - Kel, Hero and Aubrey and you are about to begin your adventure, which will be a roller coaster of many events and emotions.\n\nThe world you are about to explore is quite ambiguous and unpredictable, as is the main story. Be prepared to experience a whole range of feelings - happiness, sadness, despair, fear, anguish, anger, loneliness and much more. Also be prepared for A LOT of dialogue, because well, it is a RPG and there's so many NPCs and environments that you can interact with, so be sure that you explore as much as you can. \n\nThe gameplay is fluid and got me hooked right off the bat. I think I finished the game in 30 hours and playing for 10-11 days. You can dodge most of the enemies that are wandering around the map if you want to, but then you risk losing some valuable XP that can help you level your characters which lets them learn a new skill move. Those will be really useful against bosses, so you don't wanna miss that. The bosses in this game can be really easy or a real pain in the ass. I think I got game over screen 2-3 times but whatever, the combat isn't what the game is known for anyway. \n\nGraphics - it's a classic JRPG pixel vibe with drawn cutscenes which are amazingly done. When you compare the announcement trailer and the end product, you'll realize how much the art has improved. The scary moments and jumpscares are nicely done and are not cheesy as in some cliche horror movie. I actually got really scared quite a few times, so the horror aspect is perfectly done. \n\nThe only thing I could complain about is the rather long playtime, and I think it could have been shortened, but then again, when you take into account how immersive the game is and all the details that you can easily miss, you can only applaud Omocat for their incredible effort. Six and a half years in development ain't no joke for an INDIE game, so kudos to them.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is an heir to the throne of Silent Hill 2 - my favorite game ever, and probably one of the most important and greatest games ever made. Both games should be considered as greatest games in that specific genre about personal horror and trauma. These types of games - they are more than a game. They are on a borderline of art-forms and should be greatly appreciated. The greatest con of these games is that once you play and finish them, you'll never be able to relive them for the first time. And on top of that, they have high replay value, which is really impressive. \n\n(Spoilers about Omori and Silent Hill 2 ahead) [spoiler] The parallels between these 2 games are unreal, and I'm actually amazed that I saw very little comparisons of these two on the internet. Because the original motives of these stories are the same at the root, which is a great sin (murder) committed and remorse after it, the only difference is that on one side are spouses and on the other are siblings. Also the character development is identical - the protagonist rejects the truth and has dissociative amnesia, remembers the whole truth, then faces it and chooses what to do with his life after that, depending on the player's decisions during the game. There are A LOT more similarities but I think the point I'm trying to make is clear.  [/spoiler]\n\nThe ending of this game ALMOST made me cry. My eyes teared up and I was really close, but I did not succumb ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).

As a matter of fact, they are a necessity to remind individuals such as myself to forgive ourselves, trust ourselves, love ourselves and simply remember that our mistakes, imperfections and scars don't define the rest of our lives and who we are. To be able to deliver such strong messages is no easy task, but Omori just nails it splendidly; Although this game starts its storytelling process with a bang and there's lots of tension, mystery and suspension there right from the beginning, Omori takes it time beautifully to build everything up and prepare you for one of the most gut-wrenching endings in video games history. The shift between the tones of the more lighthearted parts of the game and the bleak and scary parts is the magic of the storytelling of Omori. Yes, all the sweet details here and there and the metaphorical and environmental storytelling is great, but what makes Omori unforgettable is the hard hitting dose of protagonist's real life in contrast of all the cute moments in Omori's universe or all the funny interactions between the gang... It just gets you.\nNot wanting to give away much about the story, let's move on to the gameplay! There's a lot to unpack here! There's this unique and interesting take on jrpg's turned based combat style in which offers you some new mechanics that are really fun to play around with. At the beginning of the game, the combat might seem a little confusing to the players who are not that familiar with turned based combat systems, but there's no need to worry cause the game does a great job at explaining the mechanics to the player. Just remember that if you want the combat to remains challenging. avoid grinding... Specially at Orange Oasis' Pyramid; You can just fly to the maximum level there. Aside from the combat there are many of puzzles and some mini games to keep things fresh and more fun, but not all of them are right there in front of you; Keep an eye open for these rewarding experiences.\nAND what can I say about the gorgeous eye candy art-style and character design of Omori that hasn't been said thousands of times before? The visuals are one of the two most important selling points of this game. You just gotta see everything for yourself. \nOverall, Yeah, I totally recommend this game.

Omori is probably the best Story game ive ever played and ever will play, dont let the pixel jrpg let you off on this game, it makes it better in my opinion. Omori's story and atmosphere blew me away, I was never bored exploring the dreamspace area of the game. The music in Omori is another part that just makes this game a masterpiece, over 179 Ost's for it and i dont dislike a single one.\nOmocat and her team really did do an amazing job creating this psychological horror jrpg. Omoris modding community bringing the rating factor up so much as well, its a very active community and some of the mods ive played are really well built and have a lot of effort put into them. The characters of Omori are some of the most well written characters in gaming , without spoiling too much each character has there own problems which u learn throughout the game and is truely depressing once youve completed the game. I love every ending in Omori (I think there is 5) some are good and some are bad BUT you should experience those for yourself. 10/10 The definition of a Masterpiece, try this game out now.

People warn you about it being a little heavy and they are NOT lying, it is a very intense game with very heavy and serious topics. I'd recommend playing something else if you're sensitive to suicide and self harm topics. But it is a very story driven game with really well written characters and fun gameplay!

From its ability to still remain somber with its subject material & still have enough side content to not be overly depressing. Its somewhat crude-hand drawn style accompanied with its music is what I feel makes this game timeless, especially with it somewhat reminding of my own childhood. The music especially, as it is somehow able to match also any part of the game perfectly, while still remaining strong just by itself. I find this to be especially apparent with the boss & faraway songs, all of which go so much harder than they have any right to. \n\nThe first day Sunny awakes from his bed is one of the best ways of introducing a passage of time, as everything before that was previously introduced about the main characters is immediately flipped on its head (aside from Kel). Especially with Aubrey, as she goes into a violent emotional wreck, while starting off as the exact opposite. As almost any character traits previously held in Headspace are no longer present when Sunny exits his house for the first time. With the game\u2019s lack of flashbacks & almost pure reliance on dialogue setting up the previous character traits naturally. This creates a feeling I find barely any games or other forms of media are able to recreate.\nEvery single main character I find has enough details to make you invested in them, without having to give off an entire backstory to accomplish it. Even many of the side characters, (primarily in Aubrey\u2019s gang) also have enough traits to separate them from just a generic NPC. Even with characters like Hero, which would be considered 1 dimensional with how they're written in the past & somewhat in the present, is eventually given more character clues if you go looking for them. This all comes together to create an atmosphere that truly parrales & is applicable to almost anyone's life in one form or another. \n\n(SPOILERS) I find the way the antagonist SOMETHING is written perfectly represents how both Basil & Sunny view their trauma. From his appearances being little more than a simple puzzle, with it being hard for them to kill you without a lot of time devoted, & yet both Sunny and Basil still fear it. This shows how, while he may not be much of a threat, he still manages to influence their actions, especially in the end of the good route. \nThe only parts which I didn't feel held up to the standard set by every other part, are things like Black Space & a bit of the horror. Manly because I find its set pieces to be too confusing to be able to tie it back to the main game. The only exception to this I feel is the Stranger, as they outright tell you what each one might represent. \n\n(SPOILERS) the way each route ends & the endings themselves are all unique in the ways you can accomplish them (excluding the good ending). The fact that going the Hikikomori route results in the same amount of gameplay content as the Sunny route, is something I\u2019ve never seen in any other game I\u2019ve played. This is especially unique as only about 7.1% of the player base has ever seen the end to the Hikikomori route. The way the Sunny route ends with a flashback through every single memory present in the photo book, & to eventually leave it open-ended while still feeling satisfied is truly an achievement. The fact that you can see the consequences of your actions before this I feel is also something that complements the Hikikomori route, as you see what happens if you don\u2019t save Basil, & choose to live in constant apathy.\n\nUltimately, the fact that OMOCAT was able to jam this much detail into a game that takes little more than 20 hours to beat is something that I feel should be followed by many others. This is because I feel that  quantity over quality is something that is being somewhat forgotten in many of the big studios\u2019 stories. Combine this with the fact that this entire game was created in RPG maker of all things, just goes to show how it doesn\u2019t take much to convey a truly captivating story. \n\n\tAll of these things is why this game has pervaded in my mind for almost a year, as my mind is unable to stop thinking about it even today. From the story, to the characters, & especially the setting & theming, it has never failed to be something I would call a masterpiece.\n\n\nP.S, If you read through all of this, thanks :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1683447878, "timestamp_updated": 1683447878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137723701": {"recommendationid": "137723701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026898529", "num_games_owned": 576, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1375, "last_played": 1692871646}, "language": "english", "review": "Omori is a FANTASIC game.\n\nIf you've been avoiding it because it's an \"Earthbound Inspired Indie RPG about Depression,\" then you're not only avoiding it under a false pretense, but you're missing out on an expertly written, heart-wrenching story.\n\nThis game inspired me to start writing an essay.

pretty easy but that was probably cause i was going for a completionist run and overgrinded. some of the headspace sections did feel like a bit of a slog at times (like sweetheart's castle which felt like it went on and on) but it was nothing frustrating to deal with. theres a ton of secrets you could easily miss with how the game never points them out to you, im pretty sure i didnt get everything even w how much i looked. so theres a lot to uncover if you like discovering stuff but its kinda annoying when you find out you missed something important.\n\nstorywise? god. the themes this game deals with are so fucking heavy but it handles them w care and balances it out w other messages the game conveys. tragedy and suffering is a constant in our life, but so is the hope that things will get better, and that no matter what, you'll always have someone to depend on no matter how hard or awful things get. it sounds kinda cheesy and cliche but friendship is a huge message this game delivers: friends should stick together no matter what and be there for each other when they need it the most. i dont think ive ever cared for a cast of characters this much. you see what this tight knit group of friends go through and how it changes who they are as people. you want to protect them and see them recover and make it through and!! man if that isnt the best feeling in the world when they do. it probably isnt the most healthy realization but i relate a lot to what some characters deal with, especially sunny's internal conflicts.\n\nall in all, omori was a game that took my heart out, stomped on it, called it a bitch, felt bad about what it done, apologized, then took it out for a nice steak dinner. the journey had its major ups and down but its all worth it in the end. like,,

An infinite perfect world of imaginary friends and foes. And while this bliss sure is colorful and joyful, there's still something lurking behind the scenes. SOMETHING that's always by your side. SOMETHING that you desperately try to forget, but SOMETHING that always finds a way to come back. SOMETHING you've been living with for too long.\n   What is the solution?

Are you just going to stay here, waiting for something to happen?\n\n\nFor more details, read the following paragraphs :\n\n   In general, the art direction of this game is astonishing. The mix of pixel art and sketchy-like style is simply wonderful. The color palette is amazing too. It has been a real pleasure the whole time; and sometimes there are great surprises, but hey! no spoil!\n\n   The combat mechanics are really clever too ; the EMOTIONS add so much life and character to the fights. Furthermore, when we're brought to brawl a lot, our group levels up. But this isn't just a matter of numbers that increase; besides that, the personalities of the characters have a more direct impact during the fights! The more the members of your group will fight, the more they will be able to work together, by increasing their stats, changing their emotions, attacking twice, encouraging each other... we trully feel an exchange between their person, and it's not a regular combat mechanic that we see in video games.\n\n   And last but certainly not least, the story. The main plot is quite intriguing and becomes more and more interesting as you play the game. I don't want to spoil, so I just ask you to play it to understand what I am talking about!\n\nYou won't regret it.

It's got a compelling narrative (if not a litttleee over-barring occasionally) and very interesting gameplay. I do have 1 problem with this game however, if you're looking for rich, complex, strategic gameplay look elsewhere. You play as a team of 4, Omori, Aubrey, Hero, and Kel, each of them have their own quirks, skills, and traits. The problem I have with this game is that since Omori is the main character, when he's knocked down, everyone is knocked down. And this to me is a game breaker in a turn based RPG. Your team is not equal. Don't go in trying to play your own way, because eventually you end up just guarding Omori for 90% of the combat because even though your whole team is thriving and winning, you could get unlucky and have the enemy target Omori once or twice because it's random and that's just it. He's dead, you're all dead. It has to be one of the lamest mechanics I've ever seen in a strategy game and it holds the game back so much for me.

Bug fix mods are a bit limited right now because of the sheer number of bugs and the fact that fixing some of them is an absolute nightmare (trust me i tried).

Throughout most of it it felt like there was an interesting story that you were trying to piece together, but honestly, the game never gave you any pieces to work with. It kept kind of dangling the same vague clue in front of your face over and over and it never really made sense, until it kind of all hit at the end. Sure, that made the end even more impactful, but it doesn't distract from the fact that the storytelling in 90% of the game was somewhat lackluster. It was engaging and fun, but it did not actually achieve or progress anything. But maybe I was just too dumb to piece all the clues together in my mind, so this might not be an issue for others.\n\nThe combat was also kinda eh? It was satisfying but mostly because it was easy, I literally did not die once in this game with minimal grinding and I am *not* good at these sorts of games, when I played the mother games I died countless times. I also entirely disregarded emotions and went full offense with all my skills and equipment, and I still never had a problem. The music and cool enemies kinda made up for it but it really could have been a little bit harder. The equipment is also pretty annoying, there's tons that do almost the same thing but with different emotions and it's really hard to actually figure out what you want for who and why, and a ton of the skills literally just say \"does some damage\" and I personally had absolutely no motivation to stray from my couple good ones to risk trying those out.\n\nOverall it was a really great experience and I enjoyed it a whole lot, the music is amazing as well, but it certainly has its flaws that keep it from being my favorite.", "timestamp_created": 1690561591, "timestamp_updated": 1690561591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542483627796173096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136613047": {"recommendationid": "136613047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184353190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1682814028}, "language": "english", "review": "finished on switch but bought it here to give more money to omocat. this game changed how i think, for sure a must play", "timestamp_created": 1681367925, "timestamp_updated": 1681367925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542483627796173096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136604237": {"recommendationid": "136604237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363073263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1509, "playtime_at_review": 1417, "last_played": 1695583171}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has amazing story and game-play!

I didn't experience a need to grind XP and the difficulty felt fair.\n\nMy main complaints are that it does feel somewhat overly long (20 hours is quite much for an RPGMaker game). Many sections overstay their welcome and certain dungeons feel kind of like a drag. A lot of the humor didn't land. Apart from one subtle scene regarding a character's background, the game didn't really manage to pull my heartstrings.\n\nThe story is mostly entertaining and keeps you guessing. Despite some major plot holes the ending wraps up the game nicely and makes up for some earlier dragging parts. Overall a mostly positive experience as long as you're patient to get past the slower parts.\n7.5/10\n\nEdit: Oh and before you may think \"You're just not the intended demographic, you don't have the past or perspective required to relate to the story's subject matters\"- nope, the touched issues should be right up my alley but just didn't feel impactful or \"genuine\".

I think the reason the game resonated so much with me is because I saw myself in Sunny, because we aren't really that different, we both locked ourselves away and shut out the whole world in order to protect ourselves and cope with the pain.\n\nThroughout the game while playing as Sunny, I was trying to right his wrongs and guide him down a better path, because in a way it felt like I was trying to fix my younger self while also making sure that Sunny doesn't end up the way I did. I've felt constant anguish ever since finishing the game and even now while writing this wall of text I still feel the same. I cannot help but think about the past that could've been and wishing that things could've gone differently. \n\nPeople always talk about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and how things get better, but my approach to life has always been to just try and be comfortable living in the dark, because it doesn't get better. But if there was a way to start life all over again then I would gladly take that chance, the things I would give just to be able to go back and have the things that I never got, like being a kid and have a chance at a normal life while being surrounded with love and having tons of friends to hangout with without having a single care in the world. \n\nBut it's too late for that.\n\n\n\nNo other game comes close to what this one made me feel, it's easily deserving of a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1693625875, "timestamp_updated": 1693641055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135514824": {"recommendationid": "135514824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799250565", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 521, "playtime_at_review": 7060, "last_played": 1695805685}, "language": "english", "review": "Craziest game of hangman I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1679875215, "timestamp_updated": 1679875215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534412980079650879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138164343": {"recommendationid": "138164343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371200750", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2101, "last_played": 1689277525}, "language": "english", "review": "Sunny made me cry man T_T", "timestamp_created": 1683855365, "timestamp_updated": 1683855365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53436809778213501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143759000": {"recommendationid": "143759000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357036263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9400, "last_played": 1691642797}, "language": "english", "review": "do i still have to go in blind", "timestamp_created": 1691642691, "timestamp_updated": 1691642691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534345865249633789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135298166": {"recommendationid": "135298166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237059164", "num_games_owned": 1387, "num_reviews": 744, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1667824216}, "language": "english", "review": "\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u4e2a\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u5c11\u6709\u4e9b\u540c\u4eba\u5927\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u4e86\uff0c\u8111\u5185\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5c81\u6708\u9759\u597d\u5f69\u8679\u5c0f\u9a6c\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u758f\u8fdc\u51b7\u6f20\uff0c\u65f6\u4e0d\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u9ed1\u8272\u602a\u7269\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8ba9\u539f\u672c\u4e0d\u592a\u7ecf\u5f97\u8d77\u63a8\u6572\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5bcc\u6709\u8282\u594f\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u60ac\u5ff5\u548c\u771f\u76f8\u63ed\u9732\u7684\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\u3002\u6d41\u7a0b\u771f\u7684\u957f\u957f\u957f\u957f\uff0c\u8981\u8d70\u4e0d\u540c\u7ebf\u8fd8\u66f4\u957f\u957f\u957f\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u4f5c\u4e0d\u81f3\u4e8e\u3002It is indeed an excellent work, but it feels like fan fiction is greater than the game.

While Earthbound and Yume Nikki are the obvious points of comparison, the game has a lot in common with last year's title Signalis, with both approaching themes of loss and dreaming, albeit with very different methods (that both carry obvious Silent Hill 2 influence adds something of a common origin to both). Between the two games, I prefered Signalis' imagery and leitmotifs moreso than Omori's, as it accomplished that harder edge that I was hoping for in Omori. Story wise however neither perfectly manage what they set out to do; as where Signalis' story was told too obliquely as to be confusing, Omori has the opposite problem of coming off much too direct in its messages as to become didactic. All in all though I enjoyed playing it and felt my appreciation of both games were strengthened when read as companion-pieces to each other despite their differences.

If you're off-put by the horror tag because you don't like scary stuff, this game is probably still fine for you.\n\nIf you are able to handle the content that's described in the content warning, play this game.

too music, too the sad and tragic story there are so many tiny details and secrets which make this game great the gameplay itself can be great at times, even in the most boring bits of the game a carried on as i had a goal to acheive being getting back to the fun parts, the way the game works down to the core is amazing, and so far there may be no sequal but maybe a prequal or a dlc can always be amazing in the future even though it may never happen, but this game is brilliant everything pairs together so well even random songs that dont make sense like 'distance' can eventually make sense when you think more about everything, like every single sound and detail is perfect for the game, even when the game was dark and scary i carried on, and the true ending was always great, and i will always come back to this game even after getting all acheivments just too play and have fun, or explore things i missed, and also maybe speedrun, there is so much this game has too offer trying too 100% this game is hard but not as hard as other games with some hard challenge instead harder ones are just like 'universally loved' ect, this game has everything and a part for all if you want fun go for hikkikomori route, if you want lore and scary stuff, go for the normal route, so much possibility may come for the future of this game idk what but i know what i am hoping for, and yeah this game is the perfect combo of everything, i could listen to the ost for hours, and if people want a challenge then they need to play hikkikomori and fight perfect heart, or maybe speedrun, i already got so many stratergys for speedrunning and i dont think i can say much more. and tip try not to spoil the game for yourself it is much more fun that way", "timestamp_created": 1695229413,

(a lengthy one for anyone interested in the opinion of strangers)\n\n->P L O T\nThe player assumes the role of Omori, the alter ego of a teenager. The world is split in two sides: Faraway Town represents reality, while HeadSpace (as the name suggests) is an imaginary place, Omori's escape from reality. The story follows Omori and his friends on their journey to find someone missing, oscillating back to the teenager's reality and so forth. The main themes and motives include friendship, family, grief, redemption, anxiety, depression, suicide ( and many others ofc). \n\nAs a depressed fellow myself, there were many aspects of the story I related to on a deeply personal level. Regardless, I find that the story can be appealing to just about anyone, as it is a wonderful mix between wholesome and disturbing( on a psychological level). OMORI combines joy and sorrow, tangling these two polar concepts successfully!\n\n( TLDR: This game will heal your poor little heart and then stomp on it with no hesitation. Then heal it again and repeat the process. You will ugly cry for hours)\n\n-> G A M E P L A Y\nThe lengthyyyyyyyyyyyy duration of the game is no worry as it keeps the player entertained with lots of fun and exciting mini side quests (optional) , as well as diverse foes (some cuter than others) to challenge using your own skills, weapons, charms and so on. Grinding is possible but definitely not necessary to advance. Difficulty is easy to medium, any foe can be defeated with a bit of planning and strategy, if none at all,  in this humble stranger's opinion. Even after finishing the game, I intend to play again knowing there are still loooooooooots of things to do and discover.\n\n(TLDR: Very fun, will keep u constantly entertained. Friendly for noobs like myself)\n\n->G R A P H I C S\nStunning. Fantastic. Amazing. Spectacular. Marvelous. Splendid. Excellent.\nI was captivated by the charming 8 bit pixel style, as well as the hand drawn sketchbook visuals. Wonderful use of colors (or lack of when necessary). \n\n(TLDR: Pretty af)\n\n-> M U S I C\nThe soundtrack of OMORI has become my favorite after finishing the game. It has everything from catchy playful tunes to heartbreaking sounds of piano and violin. I find it hard to describe music with words, but in terms of feelings the soundtracks adjusted to them accordingly. I have never felt so disturbed by ominous and eerie music before. It makes you feel....the sound of emptiness. Of course, heartwarming joy, happiness, or relief is also present when needed.\n\n(TLDR: It's like a shawarma with everything. That everything being every emotion on the spectrum)\n\n-> P R I C E \nMaybe not the most student friendly at first, but after playing, I can proudly say that i would use my entire life savings on this game if I could. Omocat, please take all my peasant money.\n\n->C O N C L U S I O N S\nOverall, this game was a 10/10 for me, I have nothing but praise for the work put into it. \nIt is heavy mentally, so I advise being careful before playing. It triggered unpleasant memories in me, but even so, OMORI has a special place in my heart after such an impact. It was really wholesome and funny, bringing a smile to my face while playing. There is a high probability that the game will change your perspective in life. Thank you, OMORI, for showing such raw, pure, nostalgic and infantile emotions to me, taking me back to an uncensored past and back again in the reality where my life goes on, but grows from every memory I have created. \n\nAnd THANK YOU, kind reader, for reaching the end of my review.

The character selection was... something. I mean I guess it was unique. Queen bee hadn't been in any Mario games besides Galaxy 1 and 2. Wiggler too, I do think that we could've had another character to switch out for him. *cough cough* Dry Bones. *cough cough* I also think Lakitu's inclusion was also a bit weird. He was already in the game and we didn't need another one as a racer. We could've easily added someone like Waluigi. Other than those characters, I think that the roster is pretty fine. The courses are good I honestly don't even remember if I found anything to be bad with them, but wait until I tell you the worst part about this game. Ladies and gentleman, the gold steering wheel. I don't mind the other gold stuff like gold tires, gold glider, and gold kart, but the gold steering wheel is something else. It is something much worse. To get the gold steering wheel, you have to play 100 matches with gyro controls for 80% of those races. This sucks. The gold steering wheel will also be taken away if you play 20 matches without using gyro control. I give Mario Kart 7 eight 7's.

The game puts a lot of details into each and every tidbit of foreshadowing and drops hints about the truth of the story no matter what point of the game you are at. This game has a lot of love put into it and that love becomes very apparent once you finish the game. The story is absolutely impeccable and I found myself becoming curious at the end of my first run, I wanted to find every single thing in the game that was hidden away. As I write this review I have already started my second run of the game. That being said, one issue I had with the game was the combat and the pacing at the beginning of the game. The beginning of Omori is really slow and it takes about 2-3 hours for it to actually pick up. (in my opinion, it's worth getting through it though) The actual game play could be better too in my opinion but it is still an extremely fun turn-based game. \n\n9/10 game play 10/10 story\n\n",

That's not to say it's a perfect game, but rather it has a story so cathartic that it's on a level I've never experienced before in gaming or elsewhere. It's a story that I think about regularly, that feels so real and so personal for someone who has experienced anxiety, intrusive thoughts, panic attacks and isolation. It's a genuine message of understanding from OMOCAT to players that have experienced that pain, and it hits me particularly right in the heart. It's sad, it's painful, it's lonely, it's scary, but there is comfort and support in the end. \n\nEverything I talk about going forward is for the \"true\" route, the other route should only be played after experiencing the game normally.\n\nI do have nitpicks that I want to get out of the way first. There are pacing issues, especially in some of the midgame Headspace segments. Headspace is basically OMORI's dream world, it's where you spend most of the game and it's also where you go through dungeons, solve puzzles and fight battles. There's very little advancing of the plot for most of these bits. Lotta cute character moments, but I know many people give up in these parts because they just want to uncover the elusive backstory or continue the plot. It's a huge shame, because the final stretch of this game serves as a sort of narrative key that recontextualizes those slow moments. It all comes together in a beautiful way in the end, if you're patient. Like, 25+ hours patient.\n\nTo remedy this, I recommend skipping as many battles as you can. The game has a weird level scaling issue where the early game is quite challenging, but if you fight everything along your way, the late game becomes mind-numbingly easy. So just run from as many battles as you can, it helps speed up the slow pace of the dungeons *and* keeps the late game challenging, but doable.\n\nOn the subject of combat. As a fan of turn-based RPGs (maybe my moogle avatar tipped that one off) I think fights are incredibly fun!! The emotion system is genuinely a unique mechanic that I've not really seen before, basically merging status effects and elemental affinities into a single system. You'll have access to dozens of skills with your 4 characters that can change your and your enemies' emotional states, provide buffs, and of course if you use your noggin, land massively powerful blows! You can also use well-timed follow-up skills while battle animations are taking place, letting you add powerful moves on-the-fly. You could tell HERO heal someone after the enemy lands a crit, or just spam OMORI's Attack Again to add extra damage. Balancing this stuff is incredibly fun and engaging from beginning to end, and your list of options is always expanding rapidly, keeping things fresh. \n\nBack to the story, something that's important to know going into the game (besides all the very important content warnings!) is that the game has a HUGE range of tones. Saccharine, melodramatic, horrific\u2014 I like to think of the way OMORI does this as a mash-up between 3 specific games. Paper Mario for the saccharine bits in the dreamworld, Mother 3 for the dramatic bits in the real world, and Yume Nikki for the horrific and surreal segments sprinkled across both. The early game is very heavy on the saccharine which... I can understand if you're not that into it. It might not be what you thought you were getting into. Stick with it, please! The dynamic between these different tones is important and intended, and like I said earlier, builds up to something amazing.\n\nSo what does it build up to, exactly? Well, I want to keep the spoilers to a minimum so I'm going to try to stick to describing the opening and then the ~vibe~ of the game. The game starts in what is actually the middle of the story. Sort of a hero-at-his-lowest-point moment. Something awful has happened and the character you control has given up on life. You don't want to leave your house, you don't want to leave your bed, all your anxieties that used to be minor hurdles for you have magnified themselves to such a degree that even being awake makes your mind run with constant fear and paranoia. You've ghosted your friends for so long that your memories of them are fading. You're hallucinating. No one is helping you. And it's getting worse. You have nothing but a carefully constructed world in your dreams entirely built out of nostalgic childhood memories. Is even this dream world going to last?\n\nSo not off to a great start are we? I'll be real, it's fucking hard. It's a struggle seeing some of yourself in the main character. Again, content warnings, but he will lead you down a dark path. But... it's not hopeless. It never really was, was it? In the end, that isolation was self-imposed, it was not forced on our character. Connection is possible, if just barely. Can you face your fears, and accept a helping hand when it comes?\n\nThere is SO MUCH to this game, it was so carefully and lovingly crafted. I hope I've piqued your interest, because maybe this game will have as much of an impact on you as it had on me. Personally, I'm very glad I had the chance for it to be a part of my life.", "timestamp_created": 1689187393, "timestamp_updated": 1689187393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141852204": {"recommendationid": "141852204", "author": {"steamid": "76561199003105950", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3550, "last_played": 1692176978}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Best game I've ever played.\n\nPro tip: don't play this on linux (with steam proton), it has some funny bugs in it.\n\n[spoiler] KEL on the ladder:\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\nHI, OMORI!\n...

Lots of good, lots of bad. The whole game is split up into two segments. To avoid spoilers I'll call them the gameplay section and the story section, cause that's what they are. The gameplay section gives you lots of random quests and has you fight enemies in typically rpg fashion. It reminds me very much of pokemon combat except with fewer \"types\" and types can be adjusted mid battle.  Pretty cool concept honestly.\n\nFor the story section, it's mostly the same thing but with way, way more optional quests to do and way less combat. I won't talk about the story much, but it explores a lot of heavy stuff as well as a few truly horrifying concepts that I haven't seen talked about anywhere else.\n\nThe music is incredible and has some brilliant boss themes. The mood throughout is mostly lots of happy fluff, (though not necessarily a bad thing,) before random bits of your insides being scrambled. My main complaint about the game is honestly that the story was so good and that I was so invested in it, that whenever a gameplay section would show up, I wasn't very eager to continue. They last for way too long and it doesn't feel like you're doing anything important. Definitely a very weak part of the game, especially for me as I have a *lot* of gripes about turn based rpgs, leveling, ect.\n\n=====100%ing the game=====\n(minor spoiler warning)\nThis is definitely far less important than the blind playthrough, but in case anyone wanted to achievement hunt for this game, let me tell you, it isn't fun. Before you do anything, get a program that can make the game run at higher speeds. Like 2-3x faster minimum. There's two routes, with several achievements exclusive to both. I would say to keep *lots* of save files but there's a max of 6. You could copy the saves folder to your desktop or somewhere else to make more if you wanted to though.\n\nAnyhow, most of the achievements are incredibly grindy and very uninteresting. These include watching a 10 second cutscene repeatedly until getting all 11 randomly generated events to happen. Spamming the flee button on enemies to farm trash to give to a recycling machine, following online guides to a tee to make sure you complete multi day long quests that give you no confirmation of having done them correctly, meaning *don't mess up or that'll cost you several hours to fix*, assuming you have saves and know exactly where you messed up.\n\nAbout half the time I have on this game was achievement grinding, and that really sucks. Definitely the most time I've put into a game that I've felt like I'm not doing anything.

If you haven't played the game knowing anything about it will badly impact your experience. I won't give any spoilers at all, just game mechanics, but this game is best completely blind so continue at your own risk.\n[spoiler]\nThe game has a leveling system where your characters get increases to all your friend's stats. For one of the fights on a second playthrough, omori got knocked out turn one, before I even had the chance to try an attack. I don't have a problem with that on optional fights, but ones that progress the story shouldn't even let you try them if the game thinks you are underleveled. It'd be nice if they added something as simple as making the earlier fights give more exp, or overworld hazards that require higher level abilities to get through.\n[/spoiler]\nThat is literally the only complaint I have about the game. The story telling, the fight mechanics, the character personalities, the humor, the artstyle, and the story itself are not only phenomenal, but exemplary for games in the future.\n", "timestamp_created": 1685655786, "timestamp_updated": 1685655786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139387455": {"recommendationid": "139387455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067606910", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1912, "last_played": 1684180751}, "language": "english", "review": "A truly brilliant emotional ride.

I did not follow a guide or optimized routes, but I think it's realistic to expect 20 - 30 hours for typical playthrough) to write this.  The best way I can describe this game without spoiling it is to say that it starts out with the casual-chaos vibes and vibrant nature akin to Adventure Time or The Adventures of Bee and Puppy Cat but it progresses slowly and seamlessly into horror.  I would definitely recommend.  More importantly, I would definitely recommend going in blind knowing as little about the actual gameplay and story as possible; this review contains no spoilers out of respect for that, so I apologize if it seems mechanical and vague.   \n\nI originally heard of this game because the youtube algorithm recommended a video to me by ThatGuyGlen, which details the controversy surrounding Omori's development and why a lot of people thought it was a scam.  Aside from showing some of the development art and clips from previews (many of which had concepts not used in the game), there's no spoilers in the video if you want to watch it (I would avoid the comment section, though).  What caught my attention is that this was a modern game that was made in the style of an early 90s top-down JRPG, that the graphics were all pixel art or hand drawn(!), and that first-and-formost, Omocat really treated the game itself as an artistic medium; Omori is very much an art project as much or more than it is a game.  The whole package was wild to me, and I had to give it a try. \n\nI'm glad I did.  The world is amazingly constructed with several unique biomes, literally thousands of objects you can interact with (and some interactions are different depending on who in your party is interacting with them), and the music just...  It fits perfectly with the both the physical environment and emotion of the world and story.  The music also somehow manages to be modern, but doesn't seem out of place for a 90s-era console RPG.  The combat system is good but not great - kinda like if Pokemon would let you have 4 critters out at once.  I wish they had more fights that relied on mechanics to keep things interesting through multiple playthroughs, because it does get a little tedious at times.  I thought the story was fantastic.  While not perfect, I found it very compelling and I appreciate that they keep some things open-ended for you to figure out and connect.  \n\nI have very few, and very small gripes, most of which are more personal preference or QoL.  For example, there are a few cut-scenes that are really single images and they aren't on the screen long enough to enjoy.  I would've liked the option to \"push X to continue\" or something, as well as a gallery to revisit later.  I wish I could button mash to advance text faster than the game allows.  The menus are intuitive, but can be cumbersome (especially inventory, and especially inventory during combat).  \n\nAt the end of the day, I wholeheartedly recommend.  I recommend a blind playthrough if you haven't been spoiled yet, and at the very least a second playthrough.  My second (and third) times through, I noticed so many details connected to the story that just didn't register the first time through.  Actually, I had even forgotten about those details until I played again.

This game has so many little details and hidden secrets that even after 95 hours of playing this game, seeing all the endings, and getting all achievements, I feel like there is still more I haven't explored. And this is only a $20.00 game! I wasn't sure if I was going to like the horror since I haven't played a lot of horror games but I really like how this game doesn't use jump-scares excessively. The game times the scares perfectly to where you almost forget its a horror game in the first place. If you are a fan of turn-based games and don't mind an extremely rich, well-made and entertaining story, then I recommend this game to you.

There's a lot of friction ! Not like I'm against a game having friction or taking its time, but it didn't seem justified here.\n\nThe turn based combat have interesting mechanics, the emotion system is nothing groundbreaking but works really well and fits within the theme of the game nicely, but it feels really sluggish, the time between animations and at the end of a fight really dragged everything down.\nDialogues are often long and can't be skipped in a meaningful way, it's particularly bad if you consider that you can basically miss a good half of the game pretty early and it makes replaying the parts you already went through pretty annoying.\nSame thing for some cutscenes that can't be skipped (like the ones where you enter a new zone with a sloooooow travelling camera across the area).\n\nThat being said, I love the art direction, the wobbly characters and cute enemies in combats, the varied environments in headspace and the colors used to depict it, making it very dreamy... Cool music too.\nI liked the story too, not quite at the level I expected with so many people raving about it but it was still quite good and had some very heartfelt moment. I wouldn't say it touched me that much but if you're dealing with guilt, it might fall closer to home for you.\n\nI would recommend Omori if you're interested in its themes.\nAlso little tip if you don't wanna miss half of the game the first time around : when your friend come banging at your door, you REALLY should open to him !", "timestamp_created": 1683855091, "timestamp_updated": 1683855091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138163072": {"recommendationid": "138163072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880235169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2861, "last_played": 1683662648}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't make game reviews but I'm bored and I'm on steam so I will\n\nOMORI as a game is amazing, the battle mechanics utilizing emotions is interesting and always allows the battles to be fresh, especially due to the fact that with certain Items you can boost the speed of party members to allow for different attack orders. Move's learned by the party are interesting as well, although the main cast all has clear things they're very good at. Hero being the healer and tank for the most part, Aubrey being able to dish out a ton of damage, and Kel being an extremely fast and useful party member being able to do both healing and high damage fast but being able to become TOAST just as fast. (Although they're jobs are insinuated via their skills you can for the most part choose how you'd like to use them for your play through.)\n\nThe story and characters are the main reason I'd recommend this game to anyone willing to give it a go. The game talks on topics most wouldn't like to share and does an amazing job at it, in my opinion all the characters are very unique and have an amazing charm to them, bosses included. The art style adding even more onto the charm of the characters being very bright and cutesy at face value but can also get dark and serious when needed.\n\nThe world is easy to get sucked into the colors are bright and the characters along with the bosses are drawn amazingly, each area has a clear difference and never really gets too boring. It allows for the freshness of the first area to be carried over to the following areas, unlocking new things to do and access overtime rewarding the player if they were to backtrack to previous areas where they couldn't do such things with items to equip and use later in the story.\n\nMy only real problem with the game is mainly the pacing towards the end. Once you get to a certain part of the game you want to do less exploring and just get to the \"bread and butter\" of the story (which at least for me in my first play through) made me opt out on A LOT of quests and things to do if I WERE to explore the world instead of moving forward with the game. (on my most recent replay of the game though I made sure I did as much quests as possible and explore as much as I could which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO.)\n\nThe pacing towards the end of the game does feel slow but it makes up for it with an amazing soundtrack, art, characters, world, and game play. Even after two play throughs of this game there is STILL more content and story I could learn and find if I were to have another go and play through OMORI once again.\n\nWith everything said I hope

As you can see now I bought the game because for me:\n\nIT IS JUST SO DAMN GOOD.\n\nConsidering that this game falls under the same categories of cryptic indie RPG games similar to games like Yume Nikki, UNDERTALE, among others, I was drawn to this game as the trailer showed already an enticing concept of a seemingly whimsical dream world. Playing through this game, I was not only proven wrong, but given a new perspective to mental illnesses and emotional nuance.\n\nSpeaking of nuance, I was pleasantly surprised as to how the story functioned, with it not entirely resolving with a one-and-done battling of hearts and minds.\nAs for the gameplay itself, some people warned that the RPG aspects of the game might get repetitive and/or a bit too easy, and while the latter might be true for what I did when I pirated the first time, the mechanics they use in the battles make me think of strategies that may or may not exist already. They're still fun every single time something does or doesn't go my way. The graphics and art are fitting with the idea of a whimsical dream world, sometimes even contradicting the situation, creating a creepy atmosphere that adds to the weight of the situation. There's a lot of depth with the art here, as it contributes directly to the main story of the game.\nI would say that some of the quests are a bit confusing at times, but thankfully, not required to experience the full weight of the game's story. Some people may not like the mechanics of the battles either or the difficulty of it, but for me, it is just chill enough to keep me engaged and wary to strategize. In short, this game is potent in emotion, hits both expected and unexpectedly, and vividly innovative. And that could go unmatched for some time.

I come from the perspective that a song is only good when you can tell that the artist is crying and screaming by the end of it in pure passion and emotion. Same thing with stories. Omori embodies exactly what a beautiful story would be, and it's so real for a lot of people.

Is also a must buy for story game lovers.\n\nHave you ever played a game? Crazy, right? Well let me be the first to inform you that your favorite game sucks unless it is this game.\n\nOmori is unlike anything you have seen before, and I'm finding it very difficult to write this, not only because words cannot describe how absolutely immaculate it is, but also because going into any level of detail at all would put me at risk for spoiling it. Even talking about the first 2 hours of the game is somewhat a spoiler. The main thing with story games (and especially this one) is that playing blind is the penultimate act of good you can do for yourself. As a result, spoiler evasion was my number 1 priority in making this review. There are many aspects of the game that I was skeptical of initially that rebutted quickly and effectively; which I will go over now, followed by some base coverage to give you a better understanding of what we're working with. Afterward, I will discuss particular aspects of the game that I found relatable to myself in order to hopefully allow you to draw connections from your experiences.\n\nFirst, I will go over the gameplay basics. By far my biggest concern was this: I hated RPG turn based combat, and I hated horror (games). Even in the first 20 minutes of the game I was pleasantly surprised at how well integrated they were with the overall flow, which prevented me from hating it. [spoiler] The combat, instead of using types like Pokemon to create interactions, instead uses emotions; which is not only a unique concept, but it also has major relevance to the story, such as heavy foreshadowing. [/spoiler]. Despite having practically zero RPG game experience, I found it incredibly easy to get into. As a whole, the game introduces itself exceptionally, and as a result, allows the story to show itself at a perfect pace while allowing people such as myself to get a hang of it.\n\nThe game primarily goes back and forth between two types of segments, which I will not go into detail of for the sake of spoilers. Throughout the experience, you meet many interesting characters, both main or otherwise, that really enhances the world and encourages you to explore and visit everything (which you should definitely do). The soundtrack introduces new motifs at every corner, and the incredibly diverse settings always pique your interest. Although it shares many basic aspects with other RPG maker games, it puts a subtle twist that makes it feel off.\n\nAnyway, let's cover some spoiler-free story basics. You play as a 12 year old boy named Omori, and you traverse the game's world \"headspace\" alongside your group of close friends: Kel, Hero, Basil, Mari, and Aubrey. Kel and Hero are brothers, while Mari is your older sister. You're free to wander and explore the whimsical characters and settings to your heart's desire. Well, that about covers all of the bases, so let's move on.\n\nNext, I will go over some parts of the game that I found generally relatable in such a way that made it hit different and stand out. I understand by this point it seems slightly redundant to say \"I want to dodge spoilers\" or whatever. To give you context of how impactful this game is when you go in blind, I'll tell you this so you understand why I'm treading carefully: Even after almost a year since I played this game for the first time, I still think about it everyday. There is zero hyperbolic intention or exaggeration in that statement. Let me compare it to another game I love to death, Red Dead Redemption 2. Don't get me wrong, it was also an absolute banger of a game, but when I played Omori I couldn't help but think RDR2 got put to shame. The story and setting was also beautiful in its own right, but I first played RDR2 three years ago and I don't really think about it often. Even during the first year after I played it, it was often a background thought. Not Omori though, not Omori. \n\nOh yeah, I forgot to mention, my story summary from earlier didn't give close to the whole picture. \"Oh but wait!\" I hear you saying, \"This is a psychological horror game! It is the main tag that people put on this game!\", and you're right. I'm partially lying to you. There's much, much more to the story that you should find out yourself. Don't worry though, it does not matter what kind of person you are. Even if you take little interest in facets of mental health, or you're scared because mental health is a sensitive topic for you, it's not a big deal. The game eases you into it, so you're not bombarded immediately. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Story beats are incredibly vague and always leave you guessing. It sounds like horrible story design, but it all catches up to you in the end as one massive depressing, but gratifying, haymaker. Except, the game's metaphorical fist is covered in barbed wire, and you're standing on the cliff edge of a volcano.\n\nWell, why do I care so much? Well I guess the first part is because it felt criminal letting it ferment in my mind for so long, but also because this game has changed me forever. They did their research. It is horrifyingly accurate to what PTSD and depression are like realistically. As somebody who is majoring in this field, with personal experience in some of the parts of the mental health topics explored (that I won't tell random people on Steam as some random bozo writing a review), I implore you to just buy it right now.\n\nDespite all of this, I still feel like I have not done the game justice, and I don't think it is possible with a review, either. It's just one of those \"you have to play/do it to understand\" type of things. As disconcerting or unhelpful as that is, I promise you that this game fulfills that title more than any other game out there.\n\nYou know what, forget the rest of this review, just buy it already.

It has some of the highest highs of a game ever, especially story wise. The way the story is told and the way that you are supposed to think about it is EXTREMELY tight, and comes close to feeling perfect. Just when you actually think about the story and rules of the world... it starts to fall a part a bit and has many underbaked aspects. NOT TO MENTION HEADSPACE. The game is incredibly bloated, full of very over ambitious, amateur-esque moments of writing that feel more like OMOCAT is hanging onto her past ideas to heavily instead of embracing what the story had truly become. It makes the replay value completely tank, and just throws off the pacing and game in general, it's filer in the worst way possible with very few moments that make you go 'wow I see how this is relevant'. The combat system is cool though, little bit similar to earthbound, sure, but overall that's fine. Found it overly easy however, which sounds dumb because I just complained about filler and adding actual grinding would be even more annoying but I kinda wish I actually feared the bosses, instead I just killed through filler and then waited for 2-3 straight bosses, not exactly the most fun. THE EMOTION SYSTEM IS SO GOOD BUT TOTALLY UNDERDEVELOPED WHY OMOCAT?? But like I said, ignoring some of the smaller things, and a large thing or two, it is an experince that totally rewards paying attention and will pull on all of your emotional heart strings. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1678824613, "timestamp_updated": 1678824613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134625084": {"recommendationid": "134625084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225583924", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1401, "last_played": 1680654196}, "language": "english", "review": "game for depressed people (me)", "timestamp_created": 1678751729, "timestamp_updated": 1678751729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134606895": {"recommendationid": "134606895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154872075", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1664785748}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't get traumatized by this if you've been traumatized already.", "timestamp_created": 1678725974, "timestamp_updated": 1678725974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134585835": {"recommendationid": "134585835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836951321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1359, "last_played": 1678606980}, "language": "english", "review": "babil", "timestamp_created": 1678690858, "timestamp_updated": 1678690858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134583719": {"recommendationid": "134583719", "author": {"steamid": "76561199020507473", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 14697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14275, "last_played": 1692324670}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece of a story.

Some things are inevitable. Tile-based movement. Top-down view. Limited graphics. But even with those limitations, I was incredibly impressed with how far they managed to push the envelope on it. The combat is IMMENSELY charming. The cut-scenes feel incredibly well-made. The worlds are colorful and bright and incredibly polished. It feels immersive, well-executed, and incredibly novel in a space that doesn't have a whole lot of extra room for novelty anymore.\n\nThe main story line of this game is phenomenal. The characters are charming and incredibly lovable, each one incredibly well-crafted. The fact that after a month of no longer playing the game, I can still remember most, if not ALL the characters, is an incredible feat not many games can pull off. I really don't want to spoil any of the content in the game, but it definitely is a game that sends your emotions on a roller coaster through so many bizarre feelings I've never really seen a game explore. It explores some really REALLY dark places. I've already put content warnings for those places up at the top. It will contrast it with some of the most wholesome, light-hearted fluff. And then it will mix the two together into such a bizarre hodgepodge that'll have you wondering how on EARTH does someone come up with this stuff. Overall, it's a story that I think anyone and EVERYONE can find interesting, and at least get something out of it, even if some might get more out than others.\n\nNow, let's talk about the soundtrack. I didn't expect to like 100% of the music inside this game but GOD. Every. Song. HITS. From the cozier vibes, to the tear-jerks, to extremely tense high-stakes badass boss fights, this game checks every single box so effortlessly you'd think that the creator had done it before (Spoilers, they really haven't). If you're someone who plays games for the soundtrack, you will NOT be disappointed. Then again, when you have the likes of Toby Fox and Bo En putting songs into the game, was there ever any doubt?\n\nThe art in this game is incredibly well made, and is probably the greatest reason why this is NOT like every other RPG Maker game out there. OMORI has this really cute sketchbook style that is really easy to fall in love with and just left me wanting to see it more. I was genuinely super excited for every moment the game would swap to have me watch an animated cutscene because they were just SO GOOD. The designs go from cutesy to incredibly strange, to downright scary in such a seamless way it's almost disturbing. It was also probably the reason me AND you clicked on the game in the first place, so there's points to be had there, too.\n\nCons. Obviously [b] if you are sensitive to content and have issues with the content above, I would avoid this game like the plague. [/b] This story will DUMP it on to you in such high proportions you might not be able to handle it. It's also an incredibly personal game. This is not the type of game I would be comfortable showing to a stream or any sort of audience. It gets extremely vulnerable in ways I'm not okay with showing to other people. Please enjoy it at your own pace, by yourself. Now onto more tangible things, actual gripes with the game. In typical RPG fashion, even the more creative uses with the combat wear thin after a while. Turn-based combat as always, will get repetitive. It will not reward you for trying new things, as the combos and synergies that work early will work throughout most of the games without too much issue. From a gameplay perspective, I REALLY wish they pushed the envelope more and tried implementing new and exciting mechanics as time passed. Another thing is the diverging paths on storylines. I love having more personalized storytelling that doesn't hold your hand and instead allows you to make mistakes, I really can't help but think it wasn't amazingly implemented. There's basically two main storylines that are almost entirely based off of ONE incredibly mild-sounding decision. And even then, one of the storylines clearly had a lot more love put into it than the other, and if you aren't playing that one first, you may not have the stamina through the incredibly slow progression of that storyline to see the game through. It happened to a friend of mine playing the game, and it broke my heart. And yeah, it's a slow-burn type of story. It will tease you with plot progression in the form of confusing the hell out of you only for you to sit back with the final picture revealed and go \"ohhhhhhhhh, okay.\" Playing the game a second time, I was basically thinking in my head \"okay, can we move on from this fluffy cutscene and get to the good part?\"\n\nOverall, this is still one of my favorite indie games ever made. It's such a full-package game between the visuals, story, and music, that you just don't get to see very often. I want to say so much more, but I really want everyone to experience it in their own way. Like I said, it's a very personal game. Pace yourself, try not to listen to how other people want you to play it, or the spoilers people give you, and enjoy the game for what you interpret it as.\n\n10/10, am looking for additional therapy.", "timestamp_created": 1678197589, "timestamp_updated": 1678197589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134228495": {"recommendationid": "134228495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078223250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2106, "last_played": 1650957804}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had my feelings pleasantly destroyed.\nPerfect story, plot twists, music.", "timestamp_created": 1678176636, "timestamp_updated": 1678176636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134205873": {"recommendationid": "134205873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395217329", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1591, "last_played": 1670109692}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1678138449, "timestamp_updated": 1678138449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134190613": {"recommendationid": "134190613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361753643", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1720, "last_played": 1689025703}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.

[/b]\nI usually don't review games but when I do its usually silly but this I just had to express my emotions somewhere. To just tell you how I felt at the end its, \"HOLY SHIT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL\" with some tears. The way how the game plays with your emotion is done brilliantly, some fucked up shit happens and the next thing you know something funny happens and you forgot what you just witnessed a few seconds ago and I have fallen for it everytime (so are others) I always forget that behind this happy, fun world hidden behind it are some traumatizing things, as if you were living in a \"dream world.\" The characters, the instant I saw them I am in love with them, everyone has their own special thing which make them different from everyone else and its just so fun to watch them interact with each other. This game is not like every horror game where a jumpscare happen every 5 second, here its slow and then gone, its gives you this eerie feeling that Something is always watching you.\n\n[b] Some spoilers after this [/b]\n\n[spoiler] The amount of time I have gotten a few tears to full on crying was beautiful. Seeing Sunny coming out of his home and facing reality even if it hurts was somewhat relatable? I am not sure, what I am for sure is and I do remember is during this time when you returned back to white space after falling into the library and seeing everyone has just vanished and you are just alone. I was at the park and interacting with the mirror saying to play hide and seek and after that I found you just broke me. The reason is I remember when I was small I did not have any friends and seeing others playing and having fun small me was sad so I would play on my own and talk to my self and have fun alone, I still interacted with my classmates and such but having a small group to talk and have fun that I did not have and I was devastated, It went on for a while, while as in from PRESCHOOL UNTIL PRIMARY I did not have anyone who was a \"real\" friend but after that I met some good people and I forgot that this even happened. When I was playing at that stage in the game and seeing Omori playing himself, the memories just hit me like a truck and i just cried, cried that this was my childhood and its being played both here and in my head. After calming my self I continued on and beated Omori :D, got the good ending not the true :/\nAlso Watermelon.

The game is around 20 hours long depending on your play style. and is worth every penny. As a person who typically like fast paced shooter games this was an odd nice change of pace. Every single character is a dynamic and loveable  character which I cant say the same for games like DOOM or Red Dead Redemption 2 (I mean characters like Kieran.) I can say 20 hours is the PERFECT amount of time to gather true connections with these characters. if one of them were to die you would feel very upset because every character has a understandable goal, personality, backstory, and loveable nature. But enough about the wonderful cast onto gameplay. Turn based combat is done with it own unique twists and turns that make it interesting. Omori, has very similar combat to that of Earthbound where every hit feels powerful and rewarding. Omori's combat can also be compared to that of Pokemon, but instead of types you have emotions, Happy beats Sad that sort of thing.  Hell OMOCAT even managed to make a turn bases combat sequence terrifying! On that note the main selling point the horror element... Perfection. The horror element takes advantage of the player being immersed in the atmosphere in some sections to scare them in a way I have never seen before. When I was playing through Omori I noticed Omori can make your heart beat faster and deeper, terrible gut feelings, the feeling of vulnerability, and being overwhelmed.

The mixture of nostalgia, horror and general fun gradient so perfectly and works so well together. I would 100% recommend anyone curious about the game, thinking about getting it or those who have never heard of it TO GO PLAY IT RIGHT NOW and especially recommend to play blind (meaning without watching any content or spoilers about it). The gameplay is smooth and simple, although sometimes i did get a bit confused on what to do at times, ether way i managed to figure it out in the end. The characters are well fleshed out and developed, you can tell omocat put in a lot of work to make the characters fell as real as possible and create a connection with the player. I can admit, at parts i did get frustrated (mainly the bosses battles) but i still had fun jamming to the absolutely astonishing music that is composed for each area and each boss (special props to the final song, i cant say its name because i dont want to spoil anyone.) The story in the game itself is well thought out and executed perfectly, both the main route and the hikikomori route, which im doing currently (Routes are different pathways in a games story that are opened by a players decision, these often will have different endings)  This game has truly touched me and i can relate to every character in a personal level, i will go as far as to say that this game will forever be a special memory for me because of how much i can relate to it. Furthermore , the representation for mental health is impeccable and describes how it feels precisely and accurately. Once again i recommend anyone who hasnt to play omori right now.

Would recommend for those who love lighthearted and silly stuff, but are also fans of dark horror and deep plot that will make your jaw drop and leave you in tears. This game is a masterpiece and shows excellent examples on how one deals with trauma and depression and overcoming that. All in all, you have an amazing cast of characters, the RPG mechanics are easy to learn, and a big world to explore and find secrets in. Not only that, but this game has a long story too. On one usual playthrough, you'll have around 25-30 hours put into it, not including the various different endings and routes you can take. This will be a game you can put multiple hours into, and still have plenty of fun doing so. The world and the characters are vibrant and fun, and the music will blow you away. The way that OMOCAT has perfectly mixed that with the hidden horror underneath the cheerful fun aspects is genius. So, if you have any interest in this game, I highly suggest getting it.

I\u2019m not usually the kind of person who goes out of my way to play RPG\u2019s. But I must say that Omori is one of the best experiences out there. The artstyle, beautiful. The soundtrack, amazing. The story, heartbreaking but powerful. \n\nBefore I get too far, this game is best experienced completely blind with no spoilers. \n\nIf you have not played the game please stop reading this review and take my word that this is one of the best games, no experience you will have from a game. Buy it, it\u2019s well worth the money. \n\n\n----MILD SPOILERS:\n\nEven just in the beginning of the game I was drawn in by the beautiful hand drawn art style and anime styled characters as well as the vibrant colours of the main characters in both Headspace and Faraway. As well as the eerily chipper and moody soundtrack of the game. Each area was incredibly well designed and each of the characters so interesting. I loved the beginning where everything seems so happy and safe until you get to Basil\u2019s house and when Something finally appears. The daytime sections with Sunny are by far the most story heavy and interesting part of the game. To look at the locations, characters, and stuff in Faraway and finding the connections in Headspace is honestly a really fun game to play. \nIt\u2019s almost impossible to not compare Omori to Undertale. Both were made with RPG maker and share that distinct art-style, as well as some of the funny and creative ideas in the Underground and Headspace respectively. I loved Undertale\u2019s combat because you were able to directly influence your character and in a sense how much damage you take. I was a little disappointed that Omori didn\u2019t include any system like that, but the combat is by no means boring. The follow up, energy, and emotion systems make combat engaging and fun. The bosses are creative and fun to fight. I do think the emotion system should be a bit more important as I found myself most just not caring about emotions and just outlasting the fights with items, but maybe I\u2019m playing the game wrong. \n\n\n=====MAJOR SPOILERS:\n\nOmori primarily is a story game and you can feel that in the gameplay. I chose to play the Hikikomori route on my first play through which was a mistake. The game is best experienced going for the true ending. In the Hikikomori route you don\u2019t learn about what happened to all the characters and it really neuters the story which sucks because the story really is beautiful. Finding out what happened to Mari was disturbing, and finding out what Omori and Basil did was horrifying. But also seeing how Sunny\u2019s friends truly cared about him and also how Sunny fights Omori, a manifestation that was created to repress the truth, inspires hope that things will work out in the end. Truly a roller-coaster of a ride playing through the game.\n\nI really want to compliment my favourite area in the game, Humphry. The whole idea that there is a laboratory inside a giant whale is insane enough. Not only that but, Humphry is able to fully control his entire body to the point of manifesting little Humphrys is just so creative. I did kinda see the twist coming where he eats you, if you can call it that, but even still it was amazing when it happened. The fleshy pink walls and bones protruding from the foreground and background really add to the environment. I\u2019d also like to talk about Pluto. One of my favourite characters. Having the in universe explanation for why Pluto isn't a plant being that he escaped from the solar system and goes on to be a regular occurrence in the game is hilarious. He really is bursting with personality and I love it.\n\n>>>>>>Spoiler's Over:\n\nIn all, this game is an amazing experience. Although, I do not recommend trying to complete all the achievements for this game. Some are really grindy and not the most fun to complete, requiring many playthroughs to get all the achievements. But nevertheless, I do recommend the game to anyone able to handle the disturbing content or really likes RPG\u2019s. 11/10 would recommend.

I can't think of any fathomable reason as to why this has been done but it is. Most of it is on a particular route, but you'll want to go through this game multiple times.\n\nThat out of the way, OMORI is beyond a once in a lifetime game that I will never forget anytime soon. The combat is simplistic for an RPG with what is basically a rock paper scissors element, but I'll be honest it's not what you come to OMORI for. It's serviceable and perfectly fine to play with, but OMORI has far better things to offer you. The writing and characters made me deeply care for and sympathize with them unlike any other game has made me done before. It gripped me at times to the point where I couldn't put the game down because I just want to continue playing. I smiled, I frowned and I even ugly cried. Despite being fictional characters that I only knew for about 25-35 hours I felt like I was seeing the whole life of a friendship between a group of friends, making me long for something I never had in my life. There are very few things that can get me to feel this way anymore so kudos to OMORI for making me feel this way. Maybe it's just because I can sympathize with the main character in a huge amount of ways, I don't know. For sure though, don't look anything up for the game if you do play it. No wikis, nothing. Just play the game and let your decisions take you where they go. Only after beating it once should you do that, but you should still try to entirely avoid spoilers for the other route's ending.\nBesides an incredibly well written story, the music is absolutely fantastic. From happy-go-lucky songs to ones that make me feel depressed, nervous or on edge it manages to do an excellent job of hitting all the right notes. The animation for the cutscenes is exquisite too, I'm a fan of 'unique' art styles that some artists can have for their work and OMORI is one of them, kind of a rough pencil/pen sketch style to it? Whatever you wanna call it I'm in love with it. OMORI blends cute, friendly \"out of this world\" themes that would fit right in alongside games such as MOTHER with paranoia-inducing creepiness. Don't go in expecting a horror game along the lines of other RPG Maker games like the Witch's House, Ao Oni or Mad Father, but instead a mash-up of MOTHER, heavy story/writing from To the Moon and notes taken out of psychological horror games such as Silent Hill.\nOn top of that there are multiple routes that you can take (mainly a 'good' path and a 'bad' path). One of them has more side content than the other, but the endings are vastly different so you'll want to do both of them regardless. There is also a few secret areas to find.\n\nI'm not even usually the type of person to replay a game immediately after finishing it to pursue a different story route but I'll be doing exactly that. I'm kicking myself for not really noticing this game until 2 years after the fact when everybody else is done with it. I just really wish OMOCAT would bring the console/xbox app exclusive content over, it's the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10/10 score.

[/h1]\nWhat a ride it has been.\n\nI cannot remember the last time a game has resonated with me as much as OMORI has. Undertale, maybe?\nWhat seems at the surface to be another indie RPG whose mother is the MOTHER series, OMORI has proven itself to rise far beyond anything that inspired it.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the game's about overcoming escapism by confronting the harsh truth.\nBut there's more to it than this. So, so much more. (Spoilers, obviously.)\n\n[spoiler] The game is utterly masterful in its plot with the accidental death of Mari, and what it chooses to reveal to you about its circumstances at what time. It's a slow boil, sure, but the game uses this to its advantage, slowly leading you along with a hint to the truth here, or a clue that shows something's not right over there, before overwhelming you by revealing everything within the last couple hours of gameplay. It's accurate, as if you were in Sunny's shoes, having repressed something for so long only for it to come flooding back within the span of three days. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Don't even get me started on the duet. I'm not a very emotional person - I never have been and I never will be. That scene cut through my shell and pierced my heart like how a knife would go through butter. I cried profusely. No other game has come close to doing that to me before. [/spoiler]\n\nI am fully confident in saying that this game will always hold a special place in my heart. It's [b] something [/b] that will stick with me forever.\nI cannot recommend any other game more highly than this one. If you have only twenty dollars to spend, I beg you - spend it on this. (If it's on sale, that's even better.)\n\n...oh, and happy second anniversary, OMORI! Here's to many more.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nTL;DR: I bought this game expecting psychological horror and got depression instead. 10/10 would let this game emotionally ruin me again.", "timestamp_created":

Ultimately, the power of the love we share is the what helps us persist and overcome.\nPlaying this game will probably help you grow as a person; You'll at least have quite a unique experience that masterfully presents the story of Omori!", "timestamp_created": 1670307876, "timestamp_updated": 1670307876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128015354": {"recommendationid": "128015354", "author": {"steamid": "76561199191508609", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1671516985}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me cry so many times, the story is too good the game is scary but also fun, and can make the darkest things seem measly to how much this game will make you feel", "timestamp_created": 1670298181, "timestamp_updated": 1670298181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128011288": {"recommendationid": "128011288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355897178", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1050, "last_played": 1689188392}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely beautiful game <33333\n\ni cried :')", "timestamp_created": 1670292249, "timestamp_updated": 1670292249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127958097": {"recommendationid": "127958097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799360996", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1672031265}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is good.

that this game is best experienced blind, with the exceptions of the content warning and:\nOPEN THE DOOR IN THE DAY. The game does not warn you at the time but it is a key moment that will completely change the game should you choose one or the other. The game is best experienced in a story aspect if you open the door. This is only one of the small gripes I have with this game. You will understand once you get to it. \n\nWith that out of the way, I can say that the music, characters, and story are all top tier. I'll go through these without spoiling anything. The soundtrack to this game is amazing and constantly dishes out bangers. The characters are charming and the world building is phenomenal. It's quite easy to get soaked into the world if you care about the characters. As I don't want to spoil too much, all I can say about the story is that it's best experienced blind and that it's really amazing.\n\nNow to address the minor complaints. Just because this game is my favorite and the best game I've ever played does not mean it is a *perfect* game. Besides the minor complaint mentioned earlier, another common complaint I see is the length of the game. Without spoiling too much, some feel that certain sections of the game could be shorter or not included at all. I will say that from a story perspective it makes sense why it is that way, but from a players perspective it might be seen as added fluff. However, if you play this game completely blind and just ride the wave, you could easily get immersed with the world and just learn to enjoy the moment.\n\nPersonally it took around 20+ hours to complete the game, but I am definitely planning on going back in to get close to 100% in this game. \n\n10/10 Game, go play it already.", "timestamp_created": 1670012950, "timestamp_updated": 1670012950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127781345": {"recommendationid": "127781345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001951703", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2083, "last_played": 1672168862}, "language": "english", "review": "The game really makes you feel like Omori", "timestamp_created": 1670006253, "timestamp_updated": 1670006253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127771692": {"recommendationid": "127771692", "author": {"steamid": "76561199201131038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1669360271}, "language": "english", "review": "i omor", "timestamp_created": 1669996976, "timestamp_updated": 1669996976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127725148": {"recommendationid": "127725148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361348227", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2353, "last_played": 1660951601}, "language": "english", "review": "omori", "timestamp_created": 1669940114, "timestamp_updated": 1669940114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127711548": {"recommendationid": "127711548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999879558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1195, "last_played": 1669920936}, "language": "english", "review": "First time writing a proper review for a game and it is for a good reason.

At first, I thought it looked different from other games and decided to give it a try. However, the first jumpscare made me uninstall the game immediately. But, the game's storyline piqued my interest, so I searched for its lore on YouTube. After watching just one video, I reinstalled the game and invited my friends to play it with me. We almost finished one ending when the Game Pass ended. Even before it ended, I had already decided to purchase the game. It's a masterpiece in every aspect - the visuals, soundtrack, and story. Although I was disappointed that the Game Pass version was different from the Steam version, and I couldn't continue with my saves, it didn't diminish the gameplay and story's quality. In my opinion, this game is up there with Minecraft, Portal 2, and Half-Life; everyone should play it, even if they're not a fan of psychological horror games. It's unfortunate that the game isn't as popular as it should be, but I believe that one day, it will be recognized as one of the greatest games ever made. It's definitely worth the money, and I played most of it for free thanks to the Game Pass. I hope that Omocat will make the Steam version more like the console version, but that doesn't bother me too much. Thank you, Omocat, for creating one of the best games ever made.

I find myself relating to the characters and care deeply about what happens to them.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a horror game, and typically these kind of games prevent me from experiencing great storytelling.

Yes, there are jumpscares, but they\u2019re not cheap. They have meaning.\n\nOmicat and the entire team made an amazing experience with this game.

that no one has heard of.  I can't stop playing it. Omori does such an amazing job of making you want to know more. It's so well made from the art style and music to the character development and the way they depict mental illness is something that I see talked about a lot but another topic they address well is the sad reality of growing up. This game is really good at making you feel like a kid with a Game Boy Advanced again.  It really captures the nostalgia of growing up right before the dawn of the internet.

One of the few games that kept me thinking about it even after I finished it. While the gameplay isn't revolutionary, the story and mystery is what makes this game so special. Definitely worth getting if you enjoy a story that'll keep you engaged the whole way through.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't anything special. Combat is simple turn based rpg maker combat, which isn't bad, but it's nothing new. Overall I'd say the gameplay is good.\n\nGreat soundtrack. Plenty of times where audio aids the atmosphere to amplify the experience.\n\nYou shouldn't have to worry about your pc specs for it.\n\nThe game itself isn't difficult. You wont be repeatedly dying to a boss and coming back annoyed. In my first playthrough I died less than 5 times. This doesn't mean the game doesn't have hard parts. I over prepared a lot which made some fights easier than they would have been. Overall, the difficulty is fairly simple, but can be challenging.\n\nYou don't need to grind at all to complete the game. It certainly can help to grind a bit but you don't have to if you don't want to. I myself grinded quite a bit early on which made fights easier.\n\nThe story is the main reason you play this game. Going into the game without knowing anything is recommended. The characters, environments, and interactions all fit together in a way that just makes the game charming. Not to mention how stunning the ending is.\n\nIt's a pretty long game, taking just over 35 hours to complete my first playthrough. Keep in mind I explored pretty much every nook and cranny I could, boosting my total hours. Without reading all the flavor text, I'd say the game is about 20-30 hours in length.\n\nAbsolutely worth the price for how much time the game takes. If it's on sale and you're debating getting the game, there's no reason not to get it.\n\nI encountered no bugs in my time playing the game. You won't have to worry about bugs.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1665444398, "timestamp_updated": 1683954314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123648488": {"recommendationid": "123648488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830682210", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1668717377}, "language": "english", "review": "this is so sad", "timestamp_created": 1665426814, "timestamp_updated": 1665426814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123633048": {"recommendationid": "123633048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426861091", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "playtime_at_review": 1229, "last_played": 1695578041}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved every second of it. 10/10 Game", "timestamp_created": 1665403708, "timestamp_updated": 1665403708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123618307": {"recommendationid": "123618307", "author": {"steamid": "76561199080212850", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4555, "last_played": 1668903421}, "language": "english", "review": "Can I make out with this game please?", "timestamp_created": 1665368340, "timestamp_updated": 1665368340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123617815": {"recommendationid": "123617815", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086107916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5125, "last_played": 1656190350}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the part where kel!", "timestamp_created": 1665367362, "timestamp_updated": 1665367362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123607283": {"recommendationid": "123607283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078013570", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1667128004}, "language": "english", "review": "it hurts :)", "timestamp_created": 1665346884, "timestamp_updated": 1665346884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123605220": {"recommendationid": "123605220", "author": {"steamid": "76561199081456746", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 444, "last_played": 1694262125}, "language": "english", "review": "If you wanna throw away every bit of happiness you have left in your life, this is greatly recommended.

That is to say, ASAP.\n     What may seem like a standard cutesy RPG with a unique battle system hides so much depth. I don't mean like intricate stat systems, I mean story. It is true that the game does drag sometimes, especially in a certain section involving  a castle and a certain section involving a whale. That is, however, MORE than made up for in everything else. If you aren't an RPG person, I still recommend seeing a playthrough of it on Youtube. So, to the chase:\n     OMORI is a game about OMORI, a boy who resides in WHITE SPACE, where he has been as long as he can remember. He leaves it daily to go and see his three other friends: KEL, HERO, and AUBREY. Alongside them is his best friend BASIL and his sister MARI. They have picnics, play games, take photos, and just have a great time. In the game, they even go around helping out the people of their happy world with problems and fighting monsters.\n     Okay, you can see the trailers and images, what is all the black and white spooky stuff about? \"Psychological Horror\"? Yes, this is one of those games that hides a lot more than it lets on. DO NOT think this is another generic cutesy but actually evil game. There is story along with it, and it is amazing in my opinion. All the stuff you may have heard about this game making people cry, I can attest to. NEVER has any piece of media made me so much as tear up. No show, no movie, no book, no game, no music. That is, until this damn game. I streamed the whole game to someone on Discord, and the last hour or so of the game was in silence. After it ended, the dam broke. I just started crying. I won't talk about why exactly, if you finish the game or finish a video of it, you'll get it.\n     Play this game as soon as you can, to avoid spoilers. It is absolutely as good as everyone has been saying. If it doesn't interest you or you don't enjoy it, that's okay too.\n     This section will contain MAJOR spoilers. Read at your own risk.\n     [spoiler] Ho-ly shit. The last hour of this game is worth some of the slower parts of HEADSPACE. BLACK SPACE, the Truth, the FINAL DUET. I still can't even think about the final duet without getting sad. Especially the part near the end where MARI saves SUNNY and it cuts to him alone, now in WHITE SPACE trying to block out the truth of her death. I also got the true good ending for watering BASIL's flowers each day. The final part where they smile to eachother was the straw the broke the camel's back for my tear ducts, more out of the rush of emotions. Sadness about the events, happiness about them being able to move on, anxiety about how the others would react. Luckily, the game keeps their reactions up to the imagination. I personally think Aubrey would need time to sort her emotions but would forgive them, Hero would need the longest time and may not even fully forgive them, and Kel would be the mediator trying to keep the group together. Hero did say they shouldn't leave eachother in a time of need like the last time. This game is an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best games I've ever played.

In every sense.\n\nI mean, the game is quite long and it feels like it shouldn't be that way. And there's a lot to keep in mind, which is kinda hard since the game switches between two worlds, with every turn taking enough time to forget what you did before you switched. And also, there's a lot of emotions to deal with, a whole spectrum of them, starting with happy (also sad and angry if yk what I mean) moments, finishing with uncertainty and confusion about some of the characters' stories.\n\nAll these points are kinda controversial, I know, and I totally wouldn't recommend this game for everyone. The thing I liked the most was digging through the stories of characters, their motifs (are there any motifs for something you didn't mean to do?), feelings , thoughts and I could keep this list going. This game gave me space for thinking, which is why I liked it. It just feels good to do some thinking from time to time, you know. Like, would I act the same way? Would I feel the same? Why did it happen like that? What could it mean? Stuff like that. I also enjoyed finding little secrets (it implies backtracking, which I enjoyed too, it had its little details), thinking through battle tactics and hoarding.

Would I recommend it? Yes, somewhat as a piece of culture, if I may say so. It's something that you should play and think through for yourself. The story was quite controversial for me, I don't agree on some things, I don't believe some things, but it made me think a lot.

Now, that doesn\u00b4t mean you shouldn\u00b4t play the game if you\u00b4re interested in it but it is something you should be aware of. If you\u00b4re in a tough spot in life right now and just want some entertainment, look elsewhere.\n\nSecondly, if you are looking for a \"traditional\" RPG, this isn\u00b4t going to be the game for you either. While OMORI does have impactful choices, they are the exception, not the rule. Aside from a major story branching early on, all \"game changing\" decisions are made right at the end, within the last two hours or so of gameplay. The game does it\u00b4s best to mask this but if you\u00b4re obeservant, you will notice how most of the choices presented are yes/no decisions that have no impact and will send you down the same route no matter what you select.\n\nGameplay wise, OMORI is very solid. In my entire playtime I haven\u00b4t encountered a single bug or glitch.\nThe combat system starts off a bit basic but picks up in complexity fast enough not to get boring. The characters each have unique skills and abilities that allow for different combinations and \"playstyles\". Although, it has to be said that at no point did the game get hard enough to force me to reconsider my tactics. Once I had a \"winning team\" with one main damage dealer and the remaining characters as support, I never had to ajust my approach and only died a few times to various bosses until I figured out their attack patterns. Whether this is something that happens in general or if I just discovered a particularly strong combination, I don\u00b4t know. On the plus, I have to say that OMORI is one of very few games where I actually felt the need to use consumables, especially in the last third.\n\nOutside of bosses, I found myself avoiding open world combat in the last half/third of the game because at that point it is just a waste of time. This game is not one where you have to scrape up every drop of XP you can get your hands on - at least in the route which I played. Even if other routes are harder (which I have been told is the case), I have seen quite a few spots where one type of high XP enemy can be farmed over and over, so even if grinding is required, there\u00b4s better ways that fighting every single grunt you encounter along the way.\n\nIn general, that is one of my few nitpicks with the game. There are a lot of unskippable cutscenes and animations that you will have to go through multiple, sometimes dozens of times. All of these things are nice touches when you first encounter them but after that they should really have been skippable as they will start to drag. \n\nIn terms of flow, the first half is perfect in terms of pacing, keeping you on your toes but not pressuring you enough to be a nail biting experience. Then the game starts to drag on... There are two particular arcs that should have been seriously shortened or moved to earlier parts of the story. The game raises the stakes immensely and then forces you to slog through literal hours of meaningless puzzles and story beats, which is a shame since that story is interesting. But at that point, I just wanted to be done with it to get continue the main plot. Fortunately, the game picks up after that again and the finale is executed excellently.\n\nNow to the story...\nI honestly do not know what to say here that wouldn\u00b4t be a spoiler. This is one of those rare pieces of media where experiencing it is the only real way of understanding it. Reading the wiki or even watching a playthrough will NOT have the same effect and not nearly the same impact. To anybody on the fence about the game, I STRONGLY recommend not looking into it before you play. Put the game on your wishlist and do not spoil yourself.\n\nWhen you do play it, the story will hit you as hard as a sledgehammer to the gut and as suddenly as a bullet to the head. I am not usually a big fan of plot twists but the ones found in this game are executed to perfection.\n\nAs to the horror aspects of the game, take the tag seriously. When they say 'horror', they really mean it. More than that, OMORI is also a TERROR game, an important distinction that most people unfortunately don\u00b4t know about. While OMORI has its fair share of jumpscares, it is the threat of the unknown and your own theories and expectations that will have you on the edge of your seat for hours. This game is nerve wracking.\n\nIf you want to play this OMORI, do it when you have the time to finish it within a week or two. It\u00b4s not an  especially long game - although replay value will up that. To really have its full impact, I believe that the story beats should still be fresh in your mind and you will miss a lot of references if they are not. \n\nOverall, OMORI is a unique masterpiece, designed less as a game do entertain and be enjoyed and more as a piece of art to be experienced.

As a game that is telling a story I think Omori does a fantastic job, and tells an engaging story with stellar music and art design. I spent the entire game wanting to get to the next story beat so I can unravel the truth behind this surreal world and story that I'm experiencing. \n\nThat being said I feel Omori kind of falls short in the gameplay department. The game has an emotion based combat system that in concept is really cool. Your team or the enemy can be neutral, sad, angry, or happy and depending on their emotion they have different effects. Like angry makes you stronger, but also lowers your defense. While the concept is cool I only really found it engaging during boss fights which are full of quirky characters and mechanics. During normal (respawning) mob encounters it felt like just a side note while I spammed the attack button and had Aubrey steam roll everything.

Games like these always bring me back to Ib and Misao, and part of me was expecting this game to play out the tradition of survival horror (simple puzzles and running away from things). Having played it now, I can say the turn-based combat is actually really fun!\n\nNaturally, you have the option to grind, but i found that simply fighting the enemies encountered in your quests will give you more than enough xp (to comfortably fight bosses). While combat is not the sole feature of the game it does makes up for the majority of gameplay. Having unique combat themes for different locations really helps to build the atmosphere and it also stop the game from feeling repetitive. The sound design is crisp, consistent and varied, which I appreciate (and i also appreciate not listening to something that makes my ears bleed jrpg fans if u know u know). Also, the bosses have unique personalities! And the casual dialogue with them helps to break away from the seriousness that this game can sometimes throw at you. \n\nVisually, the game is simple but beautiful. I find myself admiring even the really simple things (like potted plants?!). Each area has its own terrain palette and theme, and the homes that house the npcs all have intricate details that give them subtle character. There are also some cut scenes that feature hand drawn animations, these are all beautifully illustrated by omocat and hold the game's melancholic undertone.\n\nI used to follow omocat's Tumblr so I've actually been a fan of their work for a while now, and when I first heard about the game I was really excited for it :D Some time has passed since but I'm really glad I decided to give this game a shot. I've only completed one of the endings so far but I look forward to replaying the game. I hope everyone enjoyed the game as much as I did! \u02da \u0f18\u2661 \u22c6\uff61\u02da \ua565", "timestamp_created": 1669849875, "timestamp_updated": 1690720457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123731571": {"recommendationid": "123731571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183605066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1292, "last_played": 1666027806}, "language": "english", "review": "Boys have chrushes\n\nGuys have girlfriends\n\nMen lock themselves in a room for years\n\nLegends Eat Sand", "timestamp_created": 1665592186, "timestamp_updated": 1665592186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143052650": {"recommendationid": "143052650", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042148700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 13510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13510, "last_played": 1656314729}, "language": "english", "review": "erughhh.,.. aweoken from myslubmer i have. to review this freaking gmae. ok so li ke hmrmm...........................gay peoplE LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THIS ONE!!! we make in g it out of the gay perpople hood with ths one. :3. < --- yurhg\n\nhgm.. this game hjas mhmmmm a nice soundtrack :)( thats i.t. get outl.

Omori is black and white in contrast to the bright coloured dream world which shows from the start you can already tell this character had a depressing aura around him. If you were a follower of the Omori blog before the game was released you would know that the character Omori is based of the Japanese word Hikikomori which means someone who is a recluse and we can see this in the character Omori. \n\nNow, the storyline. The reason Omori is my favourite game is because of the story and because of how the story constantly does 180's to throw you off and surprise you, originally I did not know Omori was a phychological horror game so you can imagine how horrifically terrified I got at the first jump-scare. I actually recommended this game to my boyfriend and watched him play the entire game and it was so entertaining watching him get so surprised and entertained at everything that happened in the story line. Some other people watched my boyfriend play it too and they all found it really enjoyable.

The merge of gameplay and the story is great, and you feel so immersed in the world of this game that you don't even notice the time passing by.\n\nI won't go into any spoilers. THEY. WILL. BREAK. THE. EXPERIENCE. Trust me on that! The visuals and the artstyle of Omocat work wonders, and the sound effects / soundtrack fit well.\n\nThe gameplay though isn't much to write home about. If you played Earthbound or similar games, you already know most of the mechanics. Some fine additions are the Emotion and Energy systems during combat, which spice things up a little, but it's not very impactful honestly.\n\nThe game's length is perfect. Not too long, not too short. Avilability of alternate endings, and replayability are welcome features.\n\nThe game works great if you have a Steam Deck. The UI supports pad layout and there's no need to open the on-screen keyboard. However, if you'd like to see additional content, the version for Nintendo Switch has more playable characters and some little things which are absent from the Steam release.\n\nOverall: BUY. THIS.

The Headspace parts of the game are adorable, the monster/character designs are creative, and the personalities of your party members are wonderfully (god, I hate saying this word) quirky! It's not really part of the game, but the community is honestly one of the best I've seen for a horror game (and a game in general). The bosses are tough, but using strategy with emotions is really fun, and rewarding when you eventually master it! Despite all the good things I've said about the Headspace, I think the Overworld/Faraway Town is my favorite part of the game. It gives a good shift in perspective and lets you see how the real world has changed from the player's Headspace.\n\nThat's about all I can say without spoiling it.

But that's because I've spent a lot of time with this game outside of Steam.\n\nThere's no shortage of indie games these days, especially ones that show clear inspiration from retro JRPGs. Those games had a huge impact on the younger years of a generation, it's only natural they would want to emulate them. I don't say this with any sort of malicious intent, but a lot of other indie games fail to capture what made those classics magical. That is certainly not the case with Omori.\n\nYou've no doubt seen trailers and screenshots of this game that show off its colourful art style, those same trailers will also show you that there's more going on under the hood. Even if you've somehow managed to avoid seeing those, you're greeted with the black and white world of the stone-faced Omori. You will know that you're headed to a dark place. But the game will make you forget about those things, It will draw you in to the colourful, whimsical world, even if it's only for a while.\n\nThere's no shortage of moments that make you smile because they're fun, goofy, or all around charming, The game oozes charm from every pore, and it's made better by the incredible soundtrack. There are moments that are hit and miss, but the weird, wild world, and even its throwaway characters, are just so fun and memorable. \n\nI wish that this game was more popular, I truly believe that this is a well crafted gem that has a place with the classics it draws inspiration from. This might be one of my favourite RPGs made in the past decade, maybe even the past few decades.

As in, an artist learnt to make games to make Omori. It shows. As a video game it's average at best. It's mechanics aren't anything to write home about and at times it feels like they just want me to randomly walk around and click things. As a piece of art and story delivering device, it's one of the best and well worth the time and money. \n\nThe game knows exactly what it's trying to do, and does it well. It doesn't oversell, or over push anything. It respects you. The art style is charming and I've spent a lot of time just looking at all the little pictures. Care and love has been put into this game and you can see it all over. Details are littered which you can be confident 90% of people wont find, but they're there. \n\nThe story is sad, and it's warnings are accurately. It covers sensitive topics tastefully but comprehensively. It puts you in the shoes of characters who aren't the healthiest mentally, that can make it relatable and beautiful, or it could make it triggering. Really, you need to understand yourself to know which you'll find it, if that's something you've struggled with. \n\nIf you want a fun and light video game, maybe look elsewhere.

It steadily and subtly introduces new horrors to the player, but most of the time, not in a way that feels forced or \"jumpscare-y\".\n\nThis is probably the best game I've played in the past 5 years. The art style is one of the most creative and recognizable art style's I've seen (I'm also a bit of biased in the form of pixel art, so I understand if not everyone likes that). In addition, I don't think most of the horror/emotional parts of this game would hit so hard if it wasn't for the music. The entire soundtrack has a mix of action/happy/nostalgic/depressing songs, with some songs in particular managing to achieve multiple emotions at once (something I find quite rare in music). The gameplay, for the most part, is pretty standard for a turn-based RPG. Furthermore, I never really found it too difficult (I never got a game over in my first run). That being said, Omori has it's own unique elements that make fighting enemies a lot more fun and creative.\n\nThe theme and writing of this game is unlike anything I've seen before, but I want to leave this mostly spoiler free (and trust me this is way better when you know little about it going into it), so I wont be diving deep into that. [spoiler] I've only completed a few neutral endings so far - my opinion on this game might change after seeing those, who knows - but as for now, [/spoiler] I give this a 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1696463886, "timestamp_updated": 1696463886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147601696": {"recommendationid": "147601696", "author": {"steamid": "76561199519299812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1377, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1696545077}, "language": "english", "review": "Every other game is now worse because they don't have Kel in them.", "timestamp_created": 1696389576, "timestamp_updated": 1696389576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146085104": {"recommendationid": "146085104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168085476", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4647, "last_played": 1694391099}, "language": "english", "review": "Omori is an intriguing and satisfying dive into a young boy's mind as he reunites with childhood friends whilst battling personal demons. The game play at first comes across like a typical 2013 rpg maker game but the level of detail and exploration available grant it much more praise. The combat is refreshing with an emotion system that affects the stats of your party along with enemies and there is a  follow-up system used during combat so the turn based mechanics have a bit more interaction. The graphics are simple and appealing to the eye, cute and at times disturbing. What I appreciate most visually are the hand drawn cut scenes and images you encounter throughout the story, as well as hidden easter eggs. Sound design is spot on for the story and game play, it can go from something reminiscent to 90s SNES rpg battle music to foreboding and uncomfortable tones and it all fits well. The story took me by surprise, themes of isolation, childhood trauma and suppressed thoughts are commonplace and done tastefully and creatively but there was much more I did not expect. As I carried on playing I would lose track of time, eager to see what would happen next as I became quite invested in the characters. Not many games have a story that keeps me wanting more, like a book I can't put down, but Omori is certainly near the top of the list. I would implore anyone that enjoys dark psychological stories and rpgs to give this game a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1694384268, "timestamp_updated": 1694384268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3,

You should play it.\n\nCharacterization, visuals, music, writing style, world-building, thematically coherent RPG mechanics. \nIt's witty, it's cute. My favorite combination. A distinctive and charming identity that will stick with you for a lifetime.\nPerhaps push you to reminisce on your youth, things that you cherish or could've been.\nSimply memorable and delightful, even during the narrative moments that are portrayed as distressing or sad. A truly endearing experience that is bound to make you emotional, especially if you've faced similar struggles to those depicted. \n\nThe problem is... they're not depicted properly. Rather distastefully, actually, like a shallow and immature interpration of what they're supposed to look like in the real world. There's no nuance at all, even realism to it. This is pretty important for a game that purports itself to be featuring serious themes, like suicidal tendencies and remorse. You will reach a point, mostly in the latter portion, where you may feel a bit miffed about what you just witnessed, as if it didn't feel fleshed out or deserved. When you think about it real hard, you may come to the conclusion that the supposedly uplifting message the game is trying to deliver falls flat on its face. In some senses, it's even morally corrupt.\n\nTo be more specific, I mostly have a problem with the protagonist's ultimate method of dealing with his mental and emotional struggles, the drive behind his growth. Actually, even the nature of his fears and self-loathing altogether. Not to mention his concerning violent tendencies, which I really don't think should've been romanticized to this extent.\n\nThe central plot that every facet of the game is built on, the big reveal at the end, is astonishingly unhinged from reality as far as behavioral responses from human beings that aren't edge cases fit for a twisted Netflix series are concerned. Sure, it's a little funny game about a little funny world full of little funny people, but since it's not afraid to showcase examples of isolation, anxiety, even extremes of domestic, social, and economic discomfort, your suspension of disbelief can only go so far. The most frustrating part? A couple changes to 3 or 4 key scenes and dialogues, would've done the trick. So close.\n\nOverall? Fantastic, flawed, and unique pearl you should definitely add to your collection! 9/10\nI can't stop jacking off to Sunny and Basil", "timestamp_created": 1689310519, "timestamp_updated": 1689310519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135571607": {"recommendationid": "135571607", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002759499", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 432, "last_played": 1694164117}, "language": "english", "review": "W gameplay, W storytelling, W art style, W soundtracks, W depression \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1679955797, "timestamp_updated": 1679955797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133700273": {"recommendationid": "133700273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820989932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3467, "last_played": 1655964517}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been following OMOCAT's work (clothes, art, etc.) since 2013 and let me tell you she just keeps getting better and better.

Depression, Anxiety, Trauma and Grief are VERY hard to illustrate in art and media, and are very open to interpretation. I feel, for a video game, OMORI Demonstrates nearly perfect writing and storytelling, with arcs that wash over you, and last. Once i started the game, i was hooked, i wanted to see more, i didn\u2019t wanna stop playing. The story was just so attention grabbing and the art and gameplay was beautiful and fun. The characters, even the protagonist, were all wonderful, realistic, and lovable. Even with Omori as a silent protagonist, you could see some semblance of a personality, and memories. Omori isn\u2019t a standard cookie cutter protagonist, he\u2019s an actual person. The music and the art really tied this game together, and all the little secrets make replays of the game unique and interesting. I firmly cherish this game and put it at one of my all time favorite RPG\u2019s.

Despite having 13+ years of games played across consoles and PC, I genuinely cannot remember my \"favorite\" game. Everytime I am asked that, it actually takes me a minute or two to come up with an answer that I really do not care for. Sure, I have played an endless amount of good, engaging games across all genres, but the truth is that I've never really had a all-time favorite game. A game that I could truly stand by with all my passion. No game has ever really affected me deeply enough on a emotional and entertaining level to make me say \"This is truly a masterpiece, and I am glad that I got to play it.\" There has only always been good, bad, or mediocre. \n\nI was gifted OMORI as a Christmas present from a good friend, and being a fan of Lisa and UNDERTALE while being unaware of what this game was, I was sure that this game would just be in the \" good\" category. But I was dead wrong. Off from the first two hours, I knew that something about this game was special just from the music and the amazingly drawn art style, and when I thought I knew I was going to happen or how something was going to play out, I was only a victim of constant surprisal and fear. When I thought the game would hit a peak, it only kept showing me that there was more of the mountain to hike, that each time my expectations were broken and I set new ones, they were only continuously destroyed again and again. For the 36 hours I played of this game I was emotionally invested for ALL of it, which is something I cannot say about most games that come out nowadays. You really get invested into the protagonist's situation, and you start feeling for the characters that are with you on this journey the more you understand them, while the constant repression of fear and the dread of what is going to come next is in the back of your mind until the game prompts you to start being afraid. A masterful craft and use of psychological horror.\n\nThe last time I have truly [b] [i] felt [/i] [/b] something, let alone emotions formed and fueled by a video game other than small entertainment with or without friends is utterly beyond me. I do not remember if I ever have even. Maybe it is because I have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and a history of suicidal thoughts/attempts when I was younger from cancer, and it still lingers on today. Maybe it is the themes of the game itself relating to my childhood. But a game that has had this much of an effect on me, and has maybe even changed my views on somethings, is definitely worthy of being called a masterpiece.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this game to other players.", "timestamp_created": 1609956215, "timestamp_updated": 1609957206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1935, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.967250645160675049", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116719713": {"recommendationid": "116719713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198930633", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 5107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1237, "last_played": 1678535083}, "language": "english", "review": "For 20 hours, I felt like I had friends.\n\nMasterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1654778156, "timestamp_updated": 1654778156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 834, "votes_funny": 141, "weighted_vote_score": "0.967041194438934326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101726641": {"recommendationid": "101726641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170666742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1636807691}, "language": "english", "review": "you can skip the recycling machine animation with \"x\"", "timestamp_created": 1635368169, "timestamp_updated": 1635368169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 749, "votes_funny": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.965698003768920898", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116049463": {"recommendationid": "116049463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336169558", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1735, "last_played": 1653916409}, "language": "english", "review": "this game punched me in the gut, pat me on the head, gave me a cookie, and then shot me. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1653587520, "timestamp_updated": 1653587520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 590, "votes_funny": 250, "weighted_vote_score": "0.964294552803039551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92913514": {"recommendationid": "92913514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046319262", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3871, "last_played": 1622145604}, "language": "english", "review": "OMORI is a psychological horror roleplaying game which should be experienced with little to no prior knowledge of its story. It tackles dark topics which include depression, anxiety, and suicide, as per warnings. As such, this review will be avoiding anything that would be deemed too much of a spoiler past the first hour of the game, but I would highly recommend playing the game yourself first.\n\nWhat OMORI does extremely well with its storytelling is the gradual buildup from the foundation up. You know that the game is a psychological horror with topics like depression, anxiety, and suicide, but you have no idea how and when they fit into the story. While everything may seem cheerful and upbeat in the beginning, you will slowly be shown pieces of the other side, which recurs throughout the game. This leaves a lot of mystery in the beginning, allowing room for speculation on what is happening around you. However, a clearer picture does form quite literally the further you get into the game, and leads to a great climactic ending that pays off all the buildup.\n\nAs a story that heavily revolves around the characters present in the game, OMORI does an amazing job at having a cast of characters that you can really care about and can also relate to. They all have their own unique personality albeit exaggerated, which fits in with the grand scheme of things. You will be able to see the character dynamic they have with one another, and how they change throughout the story given the situation. One big thing OMORI hits home on is if you can relate to the main character; through its portrayal of depression, anxiety, and suicide, the game does a great job revolving around how those topics can have a lasting impact. That is not to say that you must have experienced those emotions before to love OMORI, but it can be extremely relatable to those who have.\n\nThe story and characters in OMORI are brought together by the visual and auditory charm the game exerts. All the soundtracks are bangers and fit their respective occurrences, ranging from relaxing exploration music to intense boss battle themes that go hard. They are definitely memorable, especially the ones at key moments throughout the game that will leave you thinking about them in the future. As for the artstyle, the pencil drawing the game uses has a unique charm to it that really fits with the story and characters in OMORI. It was always great to see it during combat and cutscenes.\n\nOMORI\u2019s combat is in the form of a turn-based RPG, which was a genre I was not the biggest fan of. That being said, I found the combat to be pretty enjoyable regardless as it had a decent amount of variety in what you could do with it. There are emotion states for your characters and enemies, which added a layer of strategy to plan for and play around. This is on top of the various skills and equipment you would unlock throughout the game, rewarding you for exploring the world. One thing that really kept my attention with the combat was the pencil artstyle; the characters and their varying expressions were always a joy to see, especially when they were at different emotional levels. The attacks you have were also great in that sense, like the headbutt\u2019s animation.\n\nIf there was one thing to criticize about the game OMORI, it is the pacing issue it has. Oftentimes I found areas to be drawn out a bit too long, especially when trying to interact with everything in the game. It can feel nonsensical at times when it is not directly related to the main story, but I was personally fine with it as you were introduced to more side characters and soundtracks. This will become an issue though if you decide to run the game again for alternate endings and/or going for a full completion, as the combat starts getting old alongside the pacing issues.\n\nI really enjoyed playing through OMORI, and it is a game I will be remembering for a long time. It has had quite the impact on me through the story it tells and also the message it ultimately delivers, and I have been thinking about it the past few days. This was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the game, and it was a blast to experience the highs and lows with the main cast of characters. I would definitely recommend this game in a heartbeat.

Because the story, characters, gameplay, world building, art, music are all 10/10 in my eyes I call this game a piece of art. I could go on and on gushing about this game but doing that wont do this game justice, just buy it and experience it yourself. This is coming from someone who never heard of the game until watching the first 30 min of it on yt second day of its release falling in love with the art style. I had 0 knowledge of the Omocat team/company, this game's kickstarter or anything prior to its release, I went in blind through my entire experience.\n\nSince it's release, the devs have released 3 free updates addressing bugs, glitches and even added additional items and features. A fourth update is incoming, which i wager will come in a week from the posting of this review. it would be an understatement to say this is the next \"big indie game.\" It handles itself and its subjects so damn well, its really beyond just an \"indie game.\" This is an experience, one that will shake you, make you laugh, make you cry, make you feel a spectrum of emotions no other game least for me, has ever come close to achieving. \n\nIf I had to put this game on a top 10 from 2020 list, this goes in my personal top 3 greatest video game experiences of all time. Its easily the number 1 2020 GOTY for me, topping GoT, hades and other games that would appear in other's GOTY lists. \nThank you Omocat team for making this work of art, an experience that I will

It TRULY deserves it and I sincerely thank my friend for gifting me this game.[/b]\n\nI want to make one thing clear immediately: Omori is absolutely NOT a game for everyone both because of the themes it touches and for some moments of the game that seem to flow apparently a bit slowly.\nThat being said, Omori is a game that captures those who want to be carried away by a well curated, non trivial story.\nI think this is the only game that has given me unique emotions. In a way I feel like I've changed after playing it and i'm really glad.\n\n[b]PLOT (there are no spoilers):[/b]\nOmori deals with the story of a deep friendship between a group of friends where you will enter the shoes of 2 characters: Omori and Sunny going, as previously mentioned, to gradually touch darker and... mysterious themes.\nthe exploratory component and the multiple interactions of the characters with the world around them in order to join the pieces of what is happening and grasp all the aftertaste of the story will prove to be particularly important.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY:[/b]\nIn addition to the exploratory component with secret roads, events for which you will also have to often retrace the steps of the character to return to places already visited, environmental puzzles, the game has a fighting system that takes up that of the Earthbound series.\n\n[b]CONCLUSIONS:[/b]\nUnfortunately to avoid spoilers I had to omit several strengths of the game but I can venture to say that if you are players who are not in a hurry to rush a game but on the contrary prefer to continue calmly exploring, interacting with the world created and appreciating the small details and if you are not afraid of more \"old style\" graphics then I think this game will not leave you disappointed at all.\n\nI wish i could forget this game, so i could get to play it again and go through all of what it has to offer.\n\nWhat a journey this was.", "timestamp_created": 1639188363, "timestamp_updated": 1641139992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 391, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.953532099723815918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91597147": {"recommendationid": "91597147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136257861", "num_games_owned": 938, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1047, "last_played": 1639045692}, "language": "english", "review": "wow omori is so cool i wish i had friends", "timestamp_created": 1620407284, "timestamp_updated": 1620407284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 657, "votes_funny": 230, "weighted_vote_score": "0.953159213066101074", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107289399": {"recommendationid": "107289399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064023321", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5029, "last_played": 1692353698}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright. 84 hours and 84 achievements. I do believe it's my time to say something.\n\nOMORI is my favorite game at this point in my life. From start to finish, the story, mechanics, and art were all perfect. Is the game itself perfect? No. Of course not, nothing is perfect. I even cherrypicked a bunch of flaws just for this review. Such as some menus being clunky, Pluto's Spaceline being a slog, some battles, especially earlygame ones not being balanced as they should, and Mr. Jawsum's entire fight.\n\nMy favorite part about OMORI is that the events are very real, and might have happened to someone on this Earth at one point in time. I don't like calling the characters characters in this game, because they are written so realistically, it feels like I knew them at one point in time. I've never been that social of a person, and even now, as I'm finishing up college, I'm starting to feel like Sunny, unsure of what to do with a not-so-bright past.\n\nI'm not one to express my emotions much while playing games, but this game has brought a few tears to my eyes and a few chills down my spine. After the fifth playthrough, they're not as prevalent anymore, but I still remember the first time I heard It Means Everything. and OMORI. Those two tracks and the scenes they're associated with are my reminders of why this game is perfect. To me at least.\n\nOmocat, if you're reading this, which you probably aren't and I don't mind, but thank you for making this game. I've always been interested in game development from a young age, and I've dabbled in it for a large portion of my life. But OMORI was finally the thing that got me to get off my ass and start making something in RPG Maker MZ. It's not big, it's only a fangame of a certain franchise I like, but I'm pulling out all the stops for it. I got artists, musicians, programmers, everyone. I wish I could do it all myself, but I'd probably be dead before I even get the script started. TL;DR I love OMORI, I love you, you inspired me a lot.\n\nI'm excited to see if you'll make more games, and thanks.

playing this game I knew I had to write one.\n\nI've played Earthbound, Mother 3, Undertale, OneShot, Yume Nikki, Corpse Party, and other indie RPG Maker games but this game tops all of them for me. I love all of the games I listed previously deeply but despite them being as great as they are this game has managed to become my favorite of all time.\n\nThis game does a great job at hiding whats to come at the beginning and I thankfully experienced it completely blind because wow is it insane. It really reminds me of Earthbound because of how crazy the ending is but it keeps you guessing at when you've reached it because once you think you're almost there it surprises you and keeps making things interesting. Without going into detail the ending and the parts leading up to it manage to top all of the RPG's I've played before it hitting you with an insane mindfuck that had me completely shocked. Again imagine the fight with Giygas from Earthbound but much much much worse (or better in a way). Then (assuming you are on the true ending) it literally hits you dead in the heart pun intended and had me on the verge of tears.\n\nThis game is a lot longer than I thought it would be and I have yet to complete the secret ending and get all the achievements but it's been an absolute pleasure to play the entire time since you never know what you'll encounter next. You can really tell how this game was influenced by Earthbound, Undertale, and Yume Nikki and that's gotta be one of my favorite parts about it because I love all of those games.\n\nThis game deserves your attention and if after all I've said you're still not convinced that you should experience this masterpiece of a game for yourself then by all means watch a let's play on it even though you should experience it for yourself by actually playing it if that's what works for you then do it.

While this game is described as a psychological horror game, it certainly doesn't feel at odds with the settings and environment, and the overarching narrative weaves the more bright and cheery aspects of the game with the... significantly less so.\n\nI would preface my review of this game with this: if you are at all sensitive to depressing topics or themes, I would not recommend this game to you. Flat out. This game absolutely explores depression, anxiety, and suicide to a length that I personally enjoy, as it is thematically interesting and engaging, but is certainly not an experience for everyone. If you are comfortable with media exploring those topics - I would highly recommend this experience. From a writing and art direction, Omori nails these topics is quite a way I don't think I've seen done before, at least not to this degree.\n\nOmori also is, very much so, a traditional turn-based RPG. However, it introduces some fairly fresh mechanics to not make it ridiculously stale. Fitting in with the ideas of the game, the main combat mechanic is that of Emotions. It's a Fire Emblem type triangle, with Happy beating Angry, Angry beating Sad, and Sad beating Happy. But, in addition to this, these emotions aren't fixed things. All members of your party's emotions can be changed during battle, as well as your opponents. This opens a very unique box of strategy of knowing how and when to set emotions in battle to get good hits. Emotions also have the unique effect of having additional effects on top of just a triangle effect - such as Sad having you drain your MP (or \"Juice\") when you're hit by an opponent. There's even more emotions beyond the base 3, but you get the core idea. This combat system is actually quite good. It's engaging and it does keep you on your toes, as enemies react in different ways to keep it fresh. The menuing and item management systems are... a bit lacking, but they don't actively inhibit the gameplay experience. \n\nI feel like I'm going to see this game compared a lot to Undertale and Mother 3. I cannot feel as if this is more wrong than people think. Yes, all 3 are quite zany (and Omori has references to both games littered throughout for those with a keen eye), but the core theming and premises of the three could not be more different. Setting aside that all 3 actually have quite different gameplay and combat mechanics (though Omori and Mother 3 are quite a bit more similar than any of them to Undertale), these games serve entirely different purposes with their stories, and all stand independent of one another. And without getting too spoiler-heavy, even Omori's \"zany world\" isn't quite as it may seem in the trailers, and certainly is not at all similar to the worlds of the other two games.\n\nOverall, Omori is an exceptional game.  A depressing game for sure, but a fantastic one nonetheless. Omocat and the Omori Team clearly put an immense amount of heart and care into this game, and I really applaud them for that. This game came out after 6 years of development because they wanted to make sure it was good - and it didn't. It came out incredible.\n\nNOTE: I do have one [i]minor[/i] complaint, which is that fullscreen mode is currently broken for the game. It has a terrible effect on the sidebars with Steam Overlay. I hope this is patched out in future versions, but I also understand this may in part be due to this being a modified RPG Maker MV game.\n\nPOST COMPLETION EDIT: Yeah this game slaps hard.

"language": "english", "review": "A profound journey into the depths of what it means to be Human.\n\nIn an era of consciousness where people have forgotten what it means to really be alive and romanticize/glamorize mental illness, OMORI is a shining example of baring the harmful effects of inner toxicity, guilt & disassociation. It is also a surprisingly poignant commentary on the friend dynamic, how fragile it is & how easy it is for things to change in your life before you even realize it. I won't touch too much on the gameplay because while I enjoy it, I found it tedious at times and the pacing of this game is it's own issue but in the end it didn't matter, it is a vehicle for the writing. OMORI is competent as an RPG, has fun and deep mechanics, but again overall you're not going to be playing this cuz of it's addicting gameplay loop, this is a much more heavy piece of art than it is an engine for fun.\n\nOMORI starts out quaint enough, giving you just enough information to believe you know what it might be about. The game does a great job at doing this throughout, as it thoroughly changed my beliefs on what the game \"really was\" several times throughout the game. I don't think it was being deceitful either, I think it truly just has a lot to say about a lot of things. Societal pressure, anxiety, troubled home life...it's all in here. It's all done in a way that is truly surprisingly well written, with all of the subtext, symbolism & metaphors you could want from any good piece of art. OMORI gives you tons and asks only from you that you observe it and give it some thought.\n\nThere are a lot of troubling things going on in the world of OMORI. The characters clearly need some therapy. These characters all represent different perspectives and dynamics from a mostly realistic depiction of a friend group. It's realistic that bonds break down over time, that things change before you can say your real feelings, that some feel the isolation hard and most people cope in different ways. The clever part of the game is that in a meta way, you cope with the events of the game in your own real life and your reaction and feelings effect how the game effectively pans out. I was shocked, horrified and confused at several points in this story, and I think it will affect many people differently and that is the intended purpose of the game. Some might reject it all and never try to see the game as it is, some might accept it all at face value, some may even make their own art as a result of the game's overall journey & ending being unsatisfying to them. And that's okay.\n\nOMORI got under my skin at many points of the story. I cried at parts that wouldn't even be considered sad, and felt no sadness at parts where I knew I should cry. It is as complex as the ocean, and I have not even explored the games other optional route. I encourage everyone to buy this game, open your mind and your heart, and let everything wash over you. Given enough time away from this game, I don't know if it will ever leave my mind, but if it does I think I'll never forget the things I learned about myself along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1612854291, "timestamp_updated": 1674608267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 412, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.934185624122619629", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89837202": {"recommendationid": "89837202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148401542", "num_games_owned": 597, "num_reviews": 220, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1617548181}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n[b]Omori[/b] is a very unique kind of game and in some aspects, I don\u2019t know how to fully describe it without spoiling things. This review will be spoiler-free and I recommend playing this 100% blind to get the best experience. It has a unique combat system with an emotion-based system tied into it that I found very interesting to utilize.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]An interesting story that goes through things like Depression, Anxiety, and Loneliness\n[*]Bosses have character development to them in battle\n[*]A unique combat system that has emotional status effects with characters interactions during battle\n[*]Follow-up attacks that have their own uses to utilize in combat\n[*]Each party member has a certain skill to use outside of combat\n[*]The art style is full of color that makes the areas you explore shine\n[*]Great soundtrack\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The emotion system is not used as much as I would have liked it to be\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nWelcome to [b]White Space[/b], you play the character [b]Omori[/b] who has been living there for as long as he can remember. There are no walls, all you see is white space and a black lightbulb hanging from the roof.  The floor is always cold with your laptop and blankets keeping you warm.  A box of tissues and a sketchbook lays nearby.\n\n[h3]Characters[/h3]\n[b]Omori[/b] has a few friends, [b]Aubrey[/b], [b]Kel[/b], and [b]Hero[/b] who will be the central focus of the story. They are looking for their best friend [b]Basil[/b] who has gone missing. [b]Omori[/b] also has a sister name [b]Mari[/b] who keeps the group supplied with food to fully heal the party when they need it.\n\nYou will be playing with emotions throughout your journey and interacting with the environment. The characters you play are young and don\u2019t really know the world around them and this I found very unique as they are growing up in this world.\n\nThe story will tackle themes of depression, anxiety, and loneliness and what it feels like to live with these emotions. It does a great job showing how people deal with each and how to overcome these things when someone is feeling down. I liked how it was done, showing us the suffering that people have to go with their struggles.\n\nI really loved how some of the bosses also had character development attached to them while you are in a battle. It adds more charm to the bosses and it fits with their corresponding theme of the areas they are in.\n\nThere is a lot I want to say about the story but I would just end up spoiling it. It\u2019s really well done and I just loved every aspect of it. I should mention that the story does get dark at times, so when you are in a happy moment, I recommend you treasure them, as things will get serious, especially as you approach the end of the story.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[b]Omori[/b] is a turned-based RPG where you will use a variety of skills in combat. There is a normal attack and skills to utilize in battle to help take out enemies. Skills require a certain amount of juice to be used, similar to mana in a traditional RPG.  Skills have a variety of uses and some will inflict [b]Emotion[/b], I\u2019ll explain a little more on this feature in a bit. At the end of every battle, you will get rewarded experience points and you will level up when you collect a certain amount. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2446392402\nYou may learn a new move from leveling up which can help you as you progress through the story.  They vary in terms of enjoyment, so it is best to experiment with them once you obtain new moves.\n\nDuring the course of the battle, your party will build up energy, which can be used to perform follow-up attacks. These attacks will always cost at least three energy, however, if you get a max of ten energy, you can perform a special attack where the whole party will attack the enemy. This method is really good for taking out bosses as it will do a big chunk of damage to them and will probably save you in a pinch. Some follow-up attacks are not as useful, so it has a bit of strategy.\n\nParty members also have abilities outside of battle that will help you access other parts of an area or to find items. [b]Omori[/b] can use his knife to cut certain objects like cones, webs, or small trees. [b]Aubrey[/b] can smash objects with her trusty bat. [b]Kel[/b] can throw his ball to activate switches, and [b]Hero[/b] can use his charm to talk to certain people to assist the party. \n\n[h3]Emotions[/h3]\n[b]Emotions[/b] can determine how characters are affected. There are a total of three emotions that you have access to in the game. [b]Happy[/b] will make your character\u2019s luck and speed increase, but your hit rate will decrease. [b]Angry[/b] will make your attack go up, however, your defense will be lowered in the process. The last one is [b]Sad[/b], your defense will increase but your damage will decrease and damage to your juice meter will also be inflected as well. These emotions can also be further increased, such as the emotion [b]Happy[/b] can turn into [b]Excited[/b] and it can go further than that. The Emotions work in a traditional combat triangle. [b]Happy[/b] beats [b]Angry[/b], [b]Angry[/b] beats [b]Sad[/b], and [b]Sad[/b] beats [b]Happy[/b], so keep these emotions in mind while fighting.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2446392899\nThis [b]Emotion[/b] mechanic is a very interesting feature of the game. However, it\u2019s not really used much and does not seem to matter for most fights. The only time it was really an issue was for one boss fight. If you have farmed enough levels, you could most likely defeat the boss with regular attacks negating any reasons to use the [b]Emotions[/b] present. This is disappointing as the [b]Emotion[/b] mechanic was something I really enjoyed and would have loved to get more use out of.\n\n[h1]Art Style, Performance, and Soundtrack[/h1]\nThe art style is hand-drawn. It looks very nice to the eyes and I liked how each area was presented. Each area is crafted very well and the character models fit with the world and the themes. I tested the game with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. The game runs really well and can run on lower spec computers. The soundtrack is very good with each song fitting with the areas of the game.  It is really nice to listen to justifying the optional DLC soundtrack.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2446446335\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n[b]Omori[/b] is a really unique RPG. I liked how it tackled the themes and showed how people learn to cope with them. It displays moments of happiness and then moments of very serious situations where everything may seem ok but it\u2019s not. I recommend [b]Omori[/b] to anyone who wants to experience a unique RPG, as it\u2019s just that, [b]Omori[/b] is not just a game, it\u2019s an experience that is worth remembering.\n\nCome on Omori, lets go hang out at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/5297658/] Life Needs a Little Sin, [/url] they have some good quality reviews", "timestamp_created": 1617726238, "timestamp_updated": 1617729206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 332, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932248830795288086", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119817643": {"recommendationid": "119817643", "author": {"steamid": "76561199130552798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10130, "last_played": 1690728503}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me mentally ill", "timestamp_created": 1659266613, "timestamp_updated": 1659266613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 298, "votes_funny": 74, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930800139904022217", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97296458": {"recommendationid": "97296458", "author": {"steamid": "76561199093169351", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1654697628}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2610 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2611 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610  Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

I'm not exactly a big fan of RPGs, and to be honest with my bias, it's usually because I'm not the best at them and/or it requires too much brainpower for me to think about what my next strategy is going to be. With that being said, I've immensely enjoyed this game from start to finish, and there are so, so many things I'd love to talk about, mainly going into the story-rich details of this somber yet bittersweet experience. \n\nSo, about the gameplay. It's your standard RPG turn-based fighting style with a very unique mechanic, and that involves this buff/nerf system for your characters. [spoiler] Your characters can become angry, happy, or sad, with each emotion having its perks and cons. For example, if your character is angry, they can dish out more damage but they become much more vulnerable to attacks. Also, certain emotions have an advantage over others. [/spoiler]\n\nThis kind of mechanic is something I've never seen before, in terms of its artistic style, and it becomes very obvious as it relates story-wise as to why this is in place. Otherwise, you kill enemies and you level up just as you would in any other RPGs. You can collect items, acquire new skills as you level up, equip different types of weapons and items (called charms) that can boost or lower certain stats for your characters. It's your bread and butter gameplay from most RPGs that, if you're familiar with, you'll be able to immediately pick up on it without any issues.\n\nThat's a majority of the game in a nutshell. However, it's not necessarily the gameplay that makes OMORI so special. The storytelling, characters, artistic, hand drawn environments, and the general themes and emotions that you'll go through as you venture on this remarkable indie RPG is what drew me in immediately. And, of course, it was recommended by one of my friends!\n\nI've enjoyed every second of this experience, which is where I want to bring up the mature content description/warning from the developers. The game heavily deals with themes and depictions of clinical depression and anxiety, and suicide. It's something that the game deals with, I believe, very carefully and yet keeps the poignant theme of it well-balanced enough for the player to enjoy. At least, it did for me.\n\nAs I'm sure you can already tell from the game's Steam page and from what I've written so far, this is not just a happy, colorful game with everything about rainbows, sunshine and butterflies. It not only deals with themes of revolving around mental illness, but of also feelings of loneliness, abandonment, hopelessness, and a general loss of energy and interest in activities that were once found enjoyable. All of these are very real depictions of clinical depression and its symptomatology, including anxiety and suicide or thoughts of suicide. Indeed, the tag of \"psychological horror\" should be taken quite literally when talking about OMORI.\n\nThe characters are absolutely adorable, and I've grown severely attached to all of them. What makes them so charming is the fact that their emotions, the things that they say, especially in regards to the mental illness elements of this game, is real. In fact, you may already know these characters in your own life. That's because the events that these video game characters have gone through, someone that you may know and love and care for have gone through the very same thing, though I'm sure not exactly the same (I should hope so!).\n\nWhat pierced my heart the most about this game is that I've been through many things similar that are shown in OMORI. It struck a personal nerve with me, though in a bittersweet way. The developers did a fantastic job in leaving an impact on the player. Even if you've never had mental illness or have faced it from a friend or loved one in any shape or form, you feel empathy in trying to comfort these characters. And, again, I do believe it was carefully done to place this throughout the game.\n\nIn terms of any negatives I have to give about this game, it just comes down to my bias for RPGs. There is eventually a point in the game, at least later on, where it becomes very \"grindy\", and instead of trying to fight off the enemies you'll run into, you'll end up running away from their encounter in an attempt to just progress the story already. But, honestly, that comes from my personal behavior on these types of games. Eventually, I got burnt out towards the end and just wanted to see the conclusion. \n\nIn terms of the horror elements of the game, as I said before, they mainly revolve around very real depictions and clinical and social impact of mental illness and its effects on one's quality of life. Granted, there are a few spooky moments in the game, but other than that, it's nothing really heavy to the point where you'll be jumping out of your seat.\n\nThe music was awesome to listen to, though that's highly dependent on where you are in the game. [spoiler] If you are in HEADSPACE as OMORI, a majority of the music, especially when fighting bosses, is upbeat and gets your blood pumping. When you play as SUNNY in the real world, it can sometimes become more melancholy and haunting, though that's dependent on what you're doing in the game. [/spoiler]\n\nIf you've made it this far in reading my wall of text, congratulations! I could continue prattling on and on about the characters and more and more about other features and elements of the game, including wrapping more spoiler tags here and there, but I do want to wrap it up here and talk a little more on the take-home message that this game sends.\n\nOMORI involves those heavy depictions of mental illness and its impact on one's life, yes, but it also is about how it affects your community, and more especially, your friends and family. There were many times in this game where I cried because of how much they reminded me about how I had great times with my friends when I was a child, and then the pains and angst of growing up from teenage years to now as an adult. There many moments in my life where I had experienced traumatic events that tore friendships asunder, only for them to come back again. And, unfortunately, there have been moments where I've lost those that I once called friends, either by my decision in separating myself from them for personal reasons, or by their own hands.\n\nThis game, as bittersweet as it was in its message, made me appreciate all the friends and people I've had in my life along the way. I've been fortunate enough to have been loved by my friends and family, and I hope, if anyone is reading this, you'll have that same fortune, and if not now, maybe one day.\n\nI strongly, strongly recommend playing this game yourself. And I want to mention something else. If you know someone in your life that you care for--a friend, family member, or whomever--is struggling with horrible thoughts and feelings, please reach out to them as soon as you can. And if you yourself are in a bind as well, I want to you know that there is absolutely no shame in seeking professional help. In my short existence in life so far, I've learned that it's better to have friends and family that love you in tackling these issues than to go at it alone.\n\n[spoiler] The game does feature multiple endings, though I did get what is considered the best ending. I may do another playthrough on the other runs, but after what I've read about them, I don't think I have the heart to do so. Even though they are fictional characters, I enjoy stories with the happiest outcomes as possible. [/spoiler]\n\nNow, to finally end it on this note from a melody that was sung to me as a child: \"Make new friends but keep the old: one is silver and the other gold.\"\n\nTake care of yourselves and keep your friends and family close to you, because in the end, that's all we have.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1654487832, "timestamp_updated": 1654487832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 232, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927261948585510254", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104185248": {"recommendationid": "104185248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953884939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 73179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72774, "last_played": 1658265859}, "language": "english", "review": "depression", "timestamp_created": 1637960344, "timestamp_updated": 1637960344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 241, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926945507526397705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114870747": {"recommendationid": "114870747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120915369", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1065, "last_played": 1651559523}, "language": "english", "review": "very good gam omori gaming\n\nQuestion is...\nWhy didn't he get a therapist and start lifting?", "timestamp_created": 1651559607, "timestamp_updated": 1651559607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 290, "votes_funny": 126, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926262021064758301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96274740": {"recommendationid": "96274740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111631620", "num_games_owned": 830, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1009, "last_played": 1626574041}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]Like my reviews? Go follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33012112-Gandhi-Talks-Games/]Curator page.[/url][/u]\n\n[b]This review is mostly spoiler free. Only one mild spoiler is mentioned, and it is covered by a spoiler tag.[/b]\n\n[i]OMORI[/i] is a fascinating game. It's one that caught my attention almost immediately, as the reviews are almost unanimously positive and had that quirky Earthbound-esque feel going for it. And yet, none of the reviews actually do anything other than say \"Get it now, go in spoiler free. Amazing game.\" Which, yes, I'd agree that it's an absolutely amazing game that you should experience as blindly as possible, but [i]OMORI[/i] is also a game that should warrant a little discussion to make sure it's for you, because it [i]definitely[/i] isn't going to click with everyone. This is my attempt at trying to sell you on one of the most creative RPGs in years with actual information about the game, but without spoiling anything.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe key defining feature of [i]OMORI's[/i] visuals is in its hand-drawn style, which I loved almost immediately. I was worried that the drawings were going to look a little too crude at times, or perhaps there'd be too much happening on the screen for me to follow it. However, none of these fears ended up being the case, as [i]OMORI[/i] used color in a very brilliant manner to help distinguish things from one another, and you aren't often fighting more than one enemy at a time (unless I just got lucky with my enemy encounters), so I ended up growing to really appreciate the art style. I'm not too keen on the UI personally, and got lost in the menus a few more times than I'd like to admit, but that's more of a nitpick than anything and not something that I'd really hold against the game. Otherwise, I enjoyed the game visually. It would've been cool to see it totally lean into the hand-drawn style, but I'm still very pleased with what's here either way.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nWhile not as impressive overall as the visuals, the gameplay still works very well overall. First, and most importantly, while psychological horror is the most popular tag for this game, I'd say that [i]OMORI[/i] is still an RPG first and foremost. The RPG and horror segments tend to be pretty separate from one another overall, but do a good job of transitioning between one or the other. The overworld segments are pretty much your standard RPG affair, and the combat mostly is the same way. However, this game has an emotion system they bring to the table, which I quite like overall. This emotion system functions like rock-paper-scissors, but what makes this system interesting is that you're able to control the emotions of both your party and the enemy, while the enemy can do the same thing. It's a pretty fun system overall, but it is a little too shallow. I wish it was expanded upon a little bit, at least with the bosses. There's a lot of potential in a system like that, but I think most of the bosses are too similar mechanically, as they often just boil down to countering whatever emotion they're stuck as since you're unable to change it. The major exception to this, from my one playthrough, was [spoiler]Sweetheart[/spoiler], who ended up being my favorite fight in the game because I felt they had a lot more control in the battle because they would change my party's emotions far more frequently than the others. I would've liked to see more of that, or perhaps more fights that rely on neutral emotions. As far as everything else goes, it's still just your typical RPG stuff. The side quests mostly boil down to fetch quests, but the appeal in those lies more in the writing and charm, which usually made them worthwhile. Overall, [i]OMORI[/i] plays more like an RPG than a horror game, but it's still pretty fun either way.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nBut, make no mistake. [i]OMORI[/i] may be an RPG, but there's still a good reason why that psychological horror tag is as popular as it is. This game is [i]incredibly[/i] dark. It makes me think of [i]BoJack Horseman[/i] in that it's a story that will absolutely wreck you, and even if you think it won't do much, you'll end up thinking about it for days, if not weeks afterwards. The main cast of characters are all extremely well-written, to a point where I liked every single one of them. I also need to commend [i]OMORI[/i] for doing a fantastic job of using the game's mechanics to help tell its story, which I think significantly helped drive home its themes. It's a game that really finds its stride at the end, providing such an emotional payoff that it's no wonder that this game has gotten as much praise as it has. However, in backloading most of the story like this, I discovered one of my only major issues with this game: the pacing. Some people will tell you that you need to get through the first few hours of the game. Others will tell you it's the middle part of the game that isn't as interesting. With the way the story is laid out, the story doesn't really make much actual progress (at least overtly) until the end, so the game is banking on you being sold on the quirky world and silly writing more than anything. While things happen, the story doesn't really move forward until that last act, if that makes sense. I understand why that is the case, but I think the game could've benefited from hinting at the revelations of the finale a little earlier and a little more often, in order to give just enough the player enough breadcrumbs to keep them asking questions. I wish I could expand upon this further, but I wouldn't be able to do so without spoiling the story. Overall, though, the story is still amazing barring the odd pacing, and the ending will still make the game worthwhile no matter how you look at it.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe sound design isn't really relevant here, as the voice acting is nonexistent and it's still an RPGMaker game at its core. However, the music in this game is absolutely incredible. It was pretty good from the get-go, but it just gets better, and better, and better. Each area gets its own overworld music, battle music, and most of the bosses have their own themes as well. I love the variety, and it absolutely nailed whatever mood they were trying to establish. It rivals [i]Undertale[/i] in terms of quality, and it wouldn't be hyperbole for most to say that [i]Undertale[/i] has one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. The music is one of the best things about the game.\n\n[h1]Content Value[/h1]\n\nWhile I've only put a little under 17 hours into this game, don't be fooled. You can get significantly more playtime out of this game, and there's a LOT of secrets and side content to experience. There are quite a few major things that I missed in my playthrough, and it's honestly very impressive to see just how much content is hidden in this game. On top of this, the ending will stick with you one way or another, so on top of actually having a lot of bang for your buck, the story is definitely not one you'll be forgetting any time soon. \n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThere's so much more I'd love to talk about, but I know I can't in order to avoid spoilers. But regardless, [i]OMORI[/i] is an absolutely amazing RPG that, while not quite a masterpiece, does come fairly close. It's very much worth your time and money, as long as you know what you're getting into.

Without getting into any of the actual games content, I can say that this may very well be one of the best games I've ever played in my life. Going into this game I didn't really know what to expect and I'm so glad for that, this is a game that is best played completely blind, but even if you know the spoilers its still 100% worth it. The soundtrack and ever changing atmosphere work together to create an absolute wonder of game design. \n\nI would also like to say that I believe this is the first game ever to actually get me to cry real tears during it, I've felt sad over games in the past, but I've never actually cried during one. A beautiful game with a message that will stick with you for a lifetime, and one I believe everyone deserves to experience in their lifetimes. I find that when a video game tells a story it is much more heartfelt than any book or movie, because you are completely immersed and all the choices feel like they are yours. \n\nAll in all, 10/10.

There is a lot of care put in the sense stimulation in the game to provide contrast, levity and make the points where things get serious actually hit the mark, but at the same time there are many moments where I don't think the game utilized it's biggest strengths to the fullest.\n\nFor the most part, the visuals and interactions tell as much as the conversations, and there is room for you to actively care about the characters, aside of the game doing everything it can to make them likable and relatable in some way. The problem is more on how the overall pacing of the game becomes a constant loop of burnt bridges, and when you're desperate to know more, having to travel a new area blind can be frustrating and discouraging. It's not that the areas and encounters aren't good, it's that they are placed in manners that feel like a mean tease after progress was just made in the plot.\n\nThis said, the story itself is a ride. The balance of symbolism, on your nose, show-don't-tell and just outright saying is very healthy, and eased equally to ensure you don't feel aggravated by a constant info dump or the usual \"indie storytelling 101\", and most of the revelations respect your intelligence to figure things out for yourself, which is already more than most video games even bother to try. \n\nCombat wise, it's a mixed bag. The RPS approach to emotional manipulation is fitting to the themes, and kids using toys and their personality just as much as their weapons is a nice carry-over of narrative enhancement. Helps there is a nice variety of encounters, bosses and battles. Sadly much like in-real-life, RPS is quite limited, so unless you constantly experiment with skills and change play-style, all fights will become very repetitive halfway into the game. Not to be a deal breaker but it can make some great bosses loose their edge, didn't stop them from being exciting and full of personality, with great theme songs and tricky situations to manage. The sheer level of new things in every area is commendable and it's great how fresh every segment is in the game, and it's undeniably satisfying to overcome hard encounters.\n\nI am being harsh, but my issues didn't stop OMORI from being an overall genuinely great experience, with a level of maturity regarding it's subject matter that you rarely find nowadays. Some ironing could have improved it as a whole, but it wasn't that much of a deal to let it ruin what probably is one of the most resonant, intimate journeys that have come out in recent memory.", "timestamp_created": 1613489370, "timestamp_updated": 1648696625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 216, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911798417568206787", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117104913": {"recommendationid": "117104913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965778187", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1962, "last_played": 1685331696}, "language": "english", "review": "i love kel.", "timestamp_created": 1655433504, "timestamp_updated": 1683857601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 328, "votes_funny": 90, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911571741104125977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88928809": {"recommendationid": "88928809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042490488", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2134, "last_played": 1626716453}, "language": "english", "review": "ayo the pizza here", "timestamp_created": 1616483539, "timestamp_updated": 1616483539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 716, "votes_funny": 702, "weighted_vote_score": "0.910591185092926025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 44227, "total_negative": 964, "total_reviews": 45191}, "cursors": {"AoIIPzawZHnSxe8D": "Fri Oct  6 16:34:28 2023"}}
