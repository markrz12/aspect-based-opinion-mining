"language": "english", "review": "The Wolf Among Us is a point and click game based on the universe of comic books. You play the Sheriff Bigby Wolf and you will have to solve a murder investigation, the game is a violent and mature thriller.\n\nThe story is very compelling, with a very well constructed universe, very well written characters with each their own stories. The voice acting, the art direction of the game and the music are very well done and make it very immersive. There are many twists in the story and you will be immersed in it from the first minutes of the game. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, it remains the classic point & click similar to other Telltales games. You will have many choices to make that will influence the story, QTEs during the action scenes and \"investigation\" phases where you can move around and search the rooms.\n\nIn conclusion this game is a must play for all point & click and narrative game fans in general. The game is worth its price, the 9-10 hours of gameplay pass very quickly and you will live a very good adventure in a unique universe.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967642193", "timestamp_created": 1682617976, "timestamp_updated": 1682617976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809768795967102051", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133631003": {"recommendationid": "133631003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344717664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1677344023}, "language": "english", "review": "I CAN FIX HIM", "timestamp_created": 1677378584, "timestamp_updated": 1677378584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.80739438533782959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141713806": {"recommendationid": "141713806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138485199", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1688985969}, "language": "english", "review": "Among Us", "timestamp_created": 1688938134, "timestamp_updated": 1688938134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 55, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800014615058898926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127726475": {"recommendationid": "127726475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165737030", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1221, "last_played": 1640262733}, "language": "english", "review": "That's a shame, that The Wolf Among Us didn't get as much attention as it deserves.

You know who said that?'[/b] -- Big Bad Wolf.\n  \nOn some days we turn our false assumptions and set-in-stone crippling beliefs off, and play games we so vigorously ignored. Quite often, those games bring us the most enjoyable experience and moments to talk about it. \nThank you to my friend Potato for bringing one of such games to my attention: not exactly what I expected, but wholeheartedly needed. <3           \n\nGoing fully blind into the game I was MILDLY confused at first. Marvel's Wolverine adventures in the Harry Potter universe? You are a BIG Wolf-Man (handsomely hot, too) in a mundane world, with regular folks and magical creatures from fairylands, legends and myths coexisting in a shaky balance. Sounds familiar? 'Fantastic Beasts' and where to find them, pretty much. And you find them in New York, of course - the most [i]iconic[/i] place to unfold the dark, grim, and quite thrilling story, based upon DC/Vertigo comic book series 'Fables'. \nIf you're like me and never heard/read about these comics before - don't worry - [b]The Wolf Among Us[/b] is a prequel to the events, happened in the first issue.\n\nTo 'taste' the story [and avoid all imaginary spoilers], picture this: you're a kid, and everything is possible. Your life is a fantasy and wonders are all around the corner. You're limitless. One day you grow up, however, and face the hardships of 'real life'. No more wonders, plenty of limitations. You go from thriving to surviving, barely able to cope with it. Can relate? Well, the game's original story is somewhat similar: various characters [called fables] from legends and tales are exiled from their mythical lands of 'happily ever after' and now live in a modern day human society, with their glamorous lives long gone and forgotten, only to face day-to-day adversity of 'normal' existence. From kids stories to grownups dark reality. There's a fragile balance, thin vale, between two worlds - magical and mundane - and most fables struggle to adapt to an unfamiliar reality, dealing with debt; taking on shoddy jobs; embracing all human vices: drinking, smoking, and hooking. For most of us it feels like an adult life: not literally, not everything, but many of us 'tasted' the darkness. We've all been/felt broken at some point - it ain't a foreign land. Or is it? For fables and supers it is: parallel between two realities merged into one: The Prince or The Frog? The Frog Prince?    \n\n[h3]The [strike]Devil[/strike] Wolf in the details.[/h3]\nThis is my first and only Telltale game so I can't compare it to any of their titles, but I was amazed on how heavily you influence the story matter, and how your decisions aren't just the decisions - you literally creating the entire, unique narration, piece after piece. You ain't just a part of the comic book story - you ARE the story. There was one moment where you had to do the sequence of actions to complete the task and I've performed it multiple times before, but this time I hesitated, for some reason. Couple of more seconds later the character nearby said something like: 'fine, I'll do it myself' and did it for you! My jaw dropped. There wasn't an indication of that, no time limit, no hints to that possibility to occur, no nothing. When you start the game there's a hint: [i]Silence is a valid option.[/i] In some cases you will get better results by simply keeping your mouth shut. Same with inaction, which is an action in disguise, and can be as valid! Sometimes by doing nothing the game will pick the choice for you, based on your attitude, and some other times the hidden option will trigger and leave you in awe. Interacting with objects in different order will give you different commentary; tiny changes in dialogue can lock/unlock further opportunities. Game is riddled like this. Your decisions will influence characters around you, form their opinions [on you and the world] and play greater consequences in the end. Cause & effect, baby. All the characters feel important, they feel alive, they have purpose.\n\nMore so, facial expressions are on the highest level. Emotions play huge part in creating the gritty, moody fantasy world, and you want those fables around you to reflect their feelings, not just talk about them. And they do! In every single interaction you can tell how and what they feel. Fear, happiness, anxiety, pretension or sadness - it's all here. Just like in LA Noire game where you could read people's faces. Except here you have an animated comic book style, which, if being humbly honest, aged phenomenally well. I am not spoiled with all the triple-A titles tho, so keep that in mind.    \n\n[h3]Severe case of Awesomeness.[/h3]\nI wish I could tell you more about the story, but these lips are sealed. Discretion is my guarantee. Just know this: first time I picked this game I finished it in one sitting -- 12 hours, taking one short dinner break, staying up all night till 5 am. I usually don't do that, but I couldn't stop. I was mesmerized by big bad wolf magic, I guess? I'm on my 3'rd playthrough now, still fascinated to the bones. My only wish is to cast a memory wipe spell and play it for first time again. ALL TIME [that's right] overwhelmingly positive Steam rating won't lie. It's [b]that[/b] good. Masterpiece of a game. The absolute beauty. And the beast.\n\nYou know what? Instead of remaking 'The Batman' origin movie every other year with questionable [for the role] actors, DC should contemplate on making a tv-series, based on the 'Fables' comics / [b]The Wolf Among Us[/b] game. If done right, it gonna be a BANGER to watch. James Gunn, take some notes, please. \n\nTo balance my euphoric review: the game isn't perfect. There are some plot holes, as Telltale changed major parts of the story during development, with some leftovers still present, leaving a lot for open discussion. Few dialogue options ain't obvious or intuitive, and can spoil your run a bit. Keep in mind that the game wasn't designed for high-end modern PC and can give you several performance issues, although most of them are easily solvable. Mine had to do with Xbox S/X controller, but I fixed it so everything runs as smooth as your PB&J sandwich now. I'm collecting all the trouble-making topics for an upcoming guide so comment down bellow, if you have any or need some help with optimizing/running the game.   \n\nConclusion: [b]The Wolf Among Us[/b] ended up being my GOTY 2022 and I've waited 10 years for this moment. Now, I know, I know.. you cannot pick a 10-year old game for that, can you? But, to quote some spider-guy: I missed the part where it's my problem. I discovered this underrated gem for the first time in 2022, so technically, it's all fair in my books. Season 2 is planned to be released this year [writing this on Jan 2023], and if it's half as good as the original and won't be delayed again? You have my GOTY 2023. Unquestionable. Just don't make it Epic exclusive for forever, Telltale, will ya?\n\nIf you'll end up buying and playing, and enjoying this game TOO much, fair warning of the following consequences:\n[list]\n[*]uncontrollable urge to book the flight to NYC;\n[*]have a drink or two; \n[*]desire to curse in British accent; \n[*]even if you don't smoke you'd want to go on a nightly walk with a cigarette in your hand;\n[*]every time someone would ask if you're okay, you will reply, with slight annoyance in your tone: I'm hunky dory. Thanks for asking.\n[/list]\n\nJoking ofc. Or am I? ;D\n\nIf you've made it till the end - LEGEND!\nMuch gratitude to y'all.

It is a great story with good dialog and interesting characters. I had no idea what I was getting into and was delighted to find it is a part of the Fables universe with characters out of various storybook tales. Part of the fun is the many references back to the old stories (in terms of dialog and scenery).\n\nThe only Telltale games I've played previously are The Walking Dead titles and this game was just as good. It has Telltale's trademark comic book art style, quick-time events, and dialog choices that impact the story (somewhat). There is a mix of narrative and combat scenes. The controls took me a bit to get used to but the game restarts at the point you were killed by being too slow with the QT prompts. I ended up playing with a keyboard and mouse because I could not manage the game with my controller. \n\nAchievements are all story-related but a handful require replaying a chapter and making different decisions. This is not a hardship, as the menu allows you to restart any chapter within any episode at any time and saves your collectibles and achievements. The game autosaves but if you quit in the middle of a chapter, some replay may be required when you return.\n\nThe Wolf Among us requires some patience. You can't speed read and click through dialog or skip cut-scenes. Each episode has a preview and a review section that cannot be skipped. And, the game is very dialog-heavy.

I adore all of the famous illustrators for their excellent artworks. Entering the Modern Age, only few of the stories or plots are great. Fables Comics series from Vertigo is one among many that I thoroughly read from start to finish. Then I stumble upon this game and instantly loving it. Most of Telltale's multiple-choices-of-consequences-by-selecting-your-adventure path-games are enjoyable to sink in for hours. Especially since this is a prequel of Fables Series, most of my free time were dedicated to play it. Not for kids, fun for adults. Some of the scenes can be brutal and gory, so if you're not into those, better stay away. Bottomline, this is one of my all-time-favorites of all great games out there. Thanks, Telltale!

The dialogue was realistic and funny as well, only making my interest for these characters grow even more. It's an incredible experience, learning more about these characters, and especially what fable each one is supposed to represent. The concept of fable characters living in the modern world is just so interesting to me, especially since I grew up hearing these fables.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a game with interesting characters, a great art style, wonderful music, and of course a story so captivating it'll have you on the edge of your seat.

It's an interactive game with a rich story and lots of decisions and actions, the choices will have consequences. It's an exciting game not only for the interesting story, but also the player needs to follow heart as most decisions are to be made within a timely manner, results could lead to character injury or death. All the decisions are final as saves happen right after decisions made, which also grant the game high replay value. The characters are from well-known fairy tales but live a modern and much darker life in Fabletown, where crime and dirty trades happen and people get numb. Luckily there are heroes like Wolf and Snow White try to keep the place in order.\n\nThe game is interesting and intense, I can't expect what is about to happen and everything happens fast, and not a single second made me feel bored. It's wonderful to experience some well known tales in a different way, and I find myself constantly wanting to discover and know more. \n\nMy top 10 games for 2023 but I believe if I played a decade ago, it would easily make the top 3.\n\n[u] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WelcomeWhyNotGames] My curator page[/url][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1687933871, "timestamp_updated": 1687933871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603174567222595215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123419408": {"recommendationid": "123419408", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091274864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1655, "last_played": 1665022199}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost 10 years later and this game still blows me away!

It's an interactive noir-style movie that grips you from start to finish. The stunning graphic style immerses you in a neon city with raindrops and blood spreading over gray asphalt. The music and voice acting complement the graphics to fully immerse you in the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe game boasts a large number of classic fairy tale characters, reinterpreted with a certain flavor of the game. The dark and twisted interpretations of fairy-tale characters in an alternate reality are visually pleasing and interesting. And stand in contrast to the modern culture of canceling fairy tales due to inappropriate content.\n\n[quote = Faith] You are not as bad as everyone says you are [/quote]\n\nAt the end of the game, there is a small ambiguity that has given rise to many theories and questions - who is the woman we see: Faith or Melissa? There are several strong arguments in favor of the woman being Faith:\n[olist]\n[*] When we ask the Mirror to show Faith, it refuses due to the enchantment. In case of death, the mirror would show a dead body, as it did with other characters.\n\n[*] Dr. Swineheart cannot definitively confirm Faith death, and there is a hint in the game of possible charm usage.\n\n[*] Recall the classic story of Faith - she takes on the form of another to escape from the kingdom and start a new life.[/olist]\n\nSo, why does Faith not return to her usual form after the end of the story? Apparently, the effect of the spell is still ongoing and before it expires, she intends to leave the city.

How you treat the characters and handle the investigations shapes the story, and it's all up to you.\n\nSure, it's got its bugs and flaws, but hey, what game doesn't? The point is, this game is an experience like no other. It's dark, gritty, and totally engrossing.

i watched youtube playthroughs of it and still remember it to this day, but re-playing it has shined extra light on the things my lack of media comprehension missed out on back then and made this even better than i remember it.\n\nshort review:\n8/10. great game with great aesthetics & story. gameplay was fulfilling and i enjoyed every fight scene immensely. suffers from the telltale disease of choices not mattering much and a rushed ending. looking forward to the sequel :)\n\nanyways\ndefinitely the best out of all the telltale games. has compelling story, aesthetics, music & moral choices with entertaining cutscenes + good gameplay depsite just being button mashing/point and click.\n\ndoes suffer from what every telltale games suffers from. choices feel not so impactful until the very last episode but even then since its the last episode you dont get to see them in action. \n\nfabletown is completely ungrateful to bigby no matter what he chooses to do, this may be intentional but there is rarely any gratification because bigby never chooses to say anything or do anything about it. there are TONS of times where bigby could just explain things that happened and literally any smart person would be on his side, \nBUT HE DOESNT and just continues to get ragged on even in situations that were obviously not his fault, when getting shot in an alley 100 times and then shot by a silver bullet the game acts like this is just no big deal. or the various times people try to fight him they act like hes just going around beating people up for no reason and bigby says nothing about it...\nthe last two episodes also felt somewhat rushed in comparison to the rest, less polish, more visual inconsitencies/bugs, etc. but i know this is probably cuz telltale was going broke around that time.\nanother thing about choices mattering, spoiler ahead, one thing i HATE is how even if you give toad money snow white straight up DEPORTS him anyway and theres nothing you can do about it because the game is ending. this literally makes no sense and toad says so himself. \nthis game also squanders opportunities to go in depth with these classism/racism issues that are so obviously placed in the tones of lots of interactions. tons of people call bigby an animal, a wolf, a dog, etc and CONSTANTLY belittle him for what he did in the old world despite him having zero control of that fact and it definitely should have been delved deeper into. \ntheres a whole place for people who cannot afford proper care that these characters get deported to and that system is not changed or fixed or addressed at all as i mentioned in my toad point.\na lot of the characters do not receive their just desserts at all. most of the characters are annoying/not good people and i did not feel bad ONCE for a single villain or adversary that was defeated. in that regard, it was unfulfilling. crane escapes to paris i believe, snow white runs everything with no repercussions or apologies for everything she said to bigby or attempted to do to aunty greanleaf, etc. meanwhile characters like tweedle dee and dum dont have their plots resolved or are ever punished for gunning down bigby. the more you think about it the more potential was left out.\ni understand that this is a noir game in a somewhat gritty detective fable world, seeing what happened to these characters or punishing them doesnt strictly have to have a good ending, it would just be preferred if it was wrapped up in any way at all, even if not ideal. \ni also absolutely despise how characters like beast are terrified of the crooked man. dude can literally turn into a BEAST... bigby does EVERYTHING alone and fights on the daily, yet people who could definitely be near his strength do nothing and then complain while bigby says nothing to defend himself a majority of the time...\n\neither way, great game. i essentially just wish choices mattered a bit more and more of the loose ends were tied up. could have done with a less rushed ending but i hope the wolf among us 2 is as good as the trailers look.", "timestamp_created": 1684994160, "timestamp_updated": 1685012402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

And the world likes it that way [/h1] \n\n[quote] [b ]Score: 8/10 [/b]  [/quote] \n\nPlaying through The Wolf Among Us was a thrilling experience, full of surprises and plot twists. The game tells a story of Fables living in the normal world among humans while excellently combining realistic and dark fantasy elements. The story puts you in the shoes of Bigby aka The Big Bad Wolf, as you do investigative work to dissolve a criminal organization and hunt down their leader. \n\nThe gameplay is simplistic, as expected from a Telltale game, with a few QTEs and dialog options, and the occasional difficult choices that alter the story. However, the main complaint that people have about Telltale games is present here - the ending doesn't seem to be greatly altered by your choices, although I think it does alter how the characters view Bigby. The game leaves you on a bit of a cliffhanger, and honestly, I'm glad I waited this long to play it, considering the sequel is coming in 2024 and we'll finally get an explanation.\n\nLast but not least, let's talk about the graphics. This game looks so good, with its comic art style that made it future-proof. The animations are a bit stiff, but nothing too noticeable.

It's based on the \"Fables\" comic book series, and it tells the story of Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of Fabletown, a hidden community of fairy tale characters who live in New York City.\n\nThe graphics in this game are absolutely stunning, and the attention to detail is remarkable. The characters are beautifully designed, and their animations are fluid and lifelike. The voice acting is also top-notch, with every character having a distinct personality and voice. The gameplay is a mix of point-and-click adventure and quick-time events. You'll be exploring different locations, talking to characters, and making decisions that will impact the story. The game is very story-driven, and your choices will have consequences that can affect the outcome of the game.\n\nOne thing that I really appreciate about \"The Wolf Among Us\" is its mature themes. This is not a game for children, as it deals with some pretty heavy stuff, like murder, prostitution, and drug abuse. However, the game handles these themes in a mature and respectful way, and it adds a lot of depth to the story. Overall, I highly recommend \"The Wolf Among Us\" to anyone who enjoys a good story-driven game with great graphics, voice acting, and mature themes.

Twice on my old Xbox 360, three times on my old Xbox One, and three times on the PC now. And there's a pretty good reason for that. Wolf Among Us is Easily one of the best games released in the last 10 years. If you're looking for a game that has great characters, a beautiful art style, and a highly engaging story... this is the game for you. \n\nThat being said, I want to post a fair review that also addresses some issues. One, while the art style is amazing, the game engine is pretty weak. Even now, nearly 10 years after the initial release, the game has bugs. Two, a big reason why bugs are still present is that the original development team went belly up a few years back. Three, because the original Telltale Games went bankrupt, this game never got its promised sequel. (Yes, I am VERY well aware that The Wolf Among Us 2 is coming out later this year. But will it be a direct sequel to this game, where all the choices you made in the first game will carry over to the new one? Highly unlikely.) And four, because the choices you make in this game will likely have no impact on the in the sequel's story, all the choice you make that \"affect\" the game don't really matter for the future installment. \n\nBut these are more nitpicks than any else. The game as a whole is phenomenal. Bigby Wolf, Snow White, and the rest of the fables are voiced with true passion. These are characters who you'll be personally invested in, making you want to see how this game goes for them. On a somber note, Its a shame that this masterpiece is basically a stand alone product who's original sequel fell victim to never being completed thanks to Telltale's bankruptcy. But to end on a good note, you'd be hard pressed to think you just got robbed of $15 bucks if you play this from beginning to end.

The car chase in the final episode is the worst example of this (it also doesn't make sense narratively)\n- Great, atmospheric soundtrack along with straight up unfinished sound mixing at points\n- A concept for a fictional universe so cool with plotholes so large and conveniences so convenient\n- Dialogue trees are fine, QTEs are bearable, but please don't require walking around clicking on things when half of the things don't even elicit a response from the character we're playing as WHAT IS THE POINT THEN\n\nBut still, a fun ride with memorable moments. Episode 5 (excluding the aforementioned car chase) might just be the best individual Telltale episode ever. Great, believable voice cast, aside from the occasional odd delivery of dialogue which for the most part was compelling and purposeful. Takes itself mostly seriously, but is self-aware enough to be low-key hilarious the handful of times it tries to be.\n\n\"This is a dance club!

The reason I write a review now is because, well, the new game is going to come out next year, and the trailer seems to have improved the animations so that they do not reuse the old animations from their previous titles.

And what good position would that character have? Well of course, he is the Sheriff of the town.\nThe perspective goes deeper though. You encounter a vast variaty of fables, and as you are the big bad wolf, you'll talk to some of your past foes, who have adapted to their new city life, whether for the better or worse.

It's 100% what you would expect from a Telltale game at this point, they seem to stick to their formula almost religiously.\n\nThe reasons why I enjoyed TWAU more than other Telltale games, were the setting and the story. The setting is based on \"The Fables\", a series of graphic novels around fairy tale characters who had to flee their homeland, and now try to make a living incognito in Manhattan. I did not know the Fables before, and I liked how they put an interesting spin on characters that were otherwise done to death, and often pretty boring to begin with (especially in their sanitized, sugar-coated versions from the ever-popular Disney movies). The Fables are anything [i]but[/i] sanitized. There is no clear line between \"good\" and \"evil\", many characters are disturbed or broken, and they all try to survive - often by desperate means - in a seedy environment far from home. Their stories tackle topics like murder, violence, blackmailing, dependency through debt, prostitution, suicide, drinking, and more.\n\nOne of my main complaints about Telltale games is that they rarely introduce me to new, exciting worlds. They usually just rehash franchises that everyone knows already. I don't really need the thirty-somethingth Batman game though, I'd rather discover and explore something fresh. And since I did not know The Fables before, TWAU provided that for me, and I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nThe plot of TWAU is at its heart a hard-boiled detective story. You play the \"Big Bad Wolf\" from the fairy tales, who has become a sheriff in the new world, and investigate a gruesome murder case that starts with a decapitation, but soon develops into things even more sinister. It is a well-designed crime mystery that kept me engaged and curious until the end.\n\nIf I have one complaint about TWAU, it's that - as usual, unfortunately - many of the choices are just illusions of such. They seem impactful during your first playthrough, but actually they just affect some minor plot points. You can play Bigby Wolf as a good-hearted cop trying to make up for his violent past by helping other Fables, or you can play him as a brutal killer who enjoys torturing people and does not care about the law - it won't change much apart from a few lines of dialogue. You do get a few meaningful choices towards the ending, at least. But while I do wish that the game had more meaningful choices, I still enjoyed it the way it is.", "timestamp_created": 1497569802, "timestamp_updated": 1497569965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905940413475036621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16635856": {"recommendationid": "16635856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143536541", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1655939131}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games i have ever played.\n\nCharacters, choices, the story, everything is great.\n\nIf you are thinking \"Should I buy this game?\" buy it.

Scroll down to see individual episode thoughts and a final conclusion.[/b][/i]\n\nAfter Telltale\u2019s breakout success with The Walking Dead, my expectations for whatever they chose to do next were understandably extremely high. Yet in the span of only the first episode, The Wolf Among Us has completely met and surpassed them leaving me stunned and impressed, feverishly awaiting the next installment (of which five are planned).\n\nBased on the graphic novel series Fables, The Wolf Among Us is set in a world populated by fairy tale creatures, from Snow White to Red Riding Hood and others I won\u2019t spoil for you. Don\u2019t think for a second that this in any way makes for a childish or overtly fantastical narrative; TWAU is a shockingly gritty, mature, and gripping piece of fiction, held together by exceptional writing and voice work. Also, fear not if you haven\u2019t read the source material (as I haven\u2019t); Telltale did an excellent job of establishing the rich world and lore, and you don\u2019t need any prior knowledge to get a lot out of it.\n\nNo character falls flat, and the performances that bring them to life are simply remarkable. Not least of them is our lead, Bigsby Wolf (you can probably guess his origin), that shows one of the key areas Telltale has improved upon from previous games. The Walking Dead was Telltale\u2019s first real attempt at providing player choice to shape the narrative, but often it didn\u2019t feel that way, largely relegating you to an onlooker \u201cpicking the right answer\u201d than an active participant in what was happening. \n\nTWAU changes that by letting you be the character you want to be. You can be the benevolent sheriff or a complete jerk, and it never felt as if I was being pushed toward either path, letting the story unfolded organically as I shaped Wolf to the person I wanted him to be, which makes the thought of what could unfold all the more exciting.\n\nTelltale has again gone with a stylized, cel-shaded graphics style which comes even closer to a moving comic than TWD, and the result is stunning. With excellent use of shadows and framing, this is a gorgeous homage to classic film noir (which proves a perfect match for the dark, mystery ridden narrative). The controls are largely unchanged from TWD but have been tightened up considerably and the bugs and glitches that plagued previous games all but eradicated, making this the developer\u2019s most technically sound production yet.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us is something you absolutely need to play. The first episode is an outstanding display of just what Telltale is capable in terms of storytelling, and if future episodes follow suit this could easily be in the running for my game of the year. The only reason I would recommend waiting is because the wait for more is going to prove unbearable. In the end all I can say is they\u2019ve left me hungry...hungry like the wolf.\n\n[b]Episode 2 Update[/b]\nIt's difficult to say much about EP2 without spoiling both it and the previous episode, so I will simply say it takes the story in even darker and more controversial areas than before. Telltale has further confirmed my original impression from EP1 that they have a bold vision for where they are taking the season, with numerous shocking and unrestrained moments fleshing out the characters and leaving me breathless in anticipation of EP3. I can only hope it doesn't take another four months to get here.\n\n[b]Episode 3 Update[/b]\nWhere the first two episodes were used to introduce us to the characters, build the world, and set the plot rolling, EP3 acts as something of a midway point both literally and figuratively. There are few if any reveals or twists on the level of prior episodes, but with how invested I am with the characters and story at this point it didn't matter that I wasn't stunned when the credits began. Each moment to moment, no matter how mundane, held my rapt attention as I eagerly ate up every line of dialog and the innumerable subtleties found in character faces and the environments that bring such depth to the narrative. While it's too early to say with certainty, if the level of quality with the final two episodes continues to increase as rapidly as it has thus far, this may very well be my game of 2014.\n\n[b]Episode 4 Update[/b]\nAt this point I'm so tightly wound up in what is easily Telltale's biggest masterpiece to date, that it's difficult for me to say anything more about TWAU without sounding like the the rabid fanboy I've become. As the season nears its end and all the lose threads begin to come together, the scope of Telltale's ambition and their ever expanding skill at directing that vision into an astounding experience is showing itself like never before. Even if the final episode falls completely flat, it won't change the fact that TWAU is easily one of the most amazing games to be released this year, and something that you shouldn't be ignoring. I'm going to be sad when it's over, but that doesn't diminish my irrepressible excitement to see how it ends.\n\n[b]Episode 5 Update And Conclusion[/b]\nWell, it's finally come to this. After months of pushed back release dates, missed timelines, and what seemed like endless waiting, The Wolf Among Us has finally seen it's last episode and cemented itself as not only the most ambitious and fully realized experience Telltale has ever made, but one of the most brilliant games of the year! EP5 incarnates everything that has been built up during past episodes, with a captivating conclusion that provides a fitting end to all that came before, while leaving room for the series to go in any number of directions with future installments.\n\nAs a whole, The Wolf Among Us is an enthralling breakthrough for Telltale and videogame storytelling as a whole. The pacing is sublime, the plot thrilling and riddled with intrigue, and the characters among the most well written and voiced I have yet to see in a game. It's shockingly brilliant in every regard and I am truly saddened that it has come to an end, for the sole reason that the wait for season 2 will feel like an eternity.\n\nTelltale has succeeded without doubt in creating a fairy tale for a modern age, one that pulls no punches and surprises with each passing moment with the lines they are willing to cross to tell the story they want, and the means they have at their disposal to do so. It's dark, violent, ugly, occasionally appalling, but more than anything an absolutely astounding achievement that should not be overlooked.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/07/09/the-wolf-among-us-review-finished/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1384757281, "timestamp_updated": 1425231003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 268, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862017393112182617", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16932033": {"recommendationid": "16932033", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970752639", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 638, "last_played": 1436177572}, "language": "english", "review": "The Wolf Among Us to me is the strongest interactive story Telltale\nhas put out to date. Yes it is better than the Walking Dead, better\nthan their new Game of Thrones (which has a lot of potential). I \ncan't call anything Telltale does a game, because tbh there is not\nmuch gameplay at all. Its mostly an interactive story. It is more \nabout chosing dialouge options and minimal investigation than\nabout ACTUAL gameplay. Which is fine, because I enjoy their\nability to tell a good story. \n\nDo not be fooled though, the game offers the illusion of choice,\nThe game will end up happening the way it is intended to no \nmatter what you chose. The only thing is you have to choose  \nwhether characters live or die, or if people hate you or not. The\nChoices in TWAU are quite good, and more than once you are\ngiven the choice of more than two options of what to investigate\nor chose. Which I like. \n\nThe characters are expertly voiced and acted. The music and \nentire setting has a real Noir flair to it, which I was instantly in\nlove with. This game has a fantastic story with an intriuging world\nfull of mystery and excellent characters. Bigby Wolf the main\ncharacter you play is one of my favorite protagonists second\nonly to Geralt of Rivia. \n\nThat being said if you enjoy what Telltale does, this is its best\nwork in my opinion. Most people will love Walking Dead more\nsimply because it is the world that interests them more.

This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)\n\nFollowing the success of The Walking Dead, TellTale continues their tradition of interactive story based games with The Wolf Among Us.  Based off the Fables graphic novels, the Wolf Among us follows Bigby Wolf the newly reformed big bad wolf and appointed sheriff of Fabletown, a community within New York City that houses a plethora of washed up fable characters.  While enforcing the fabletown laws a series of events plunges Bigby into a murder investigation that involves the entire fable community where everyone is a suspect.\n\nThe interplay between the various characters is handled well with witty banter and humorous responses that take advantage of the history behind every citizen.  Compared to the Walking Dead, the story moves along at a brisk pace with significantly less time spent in conversation hub areas requiring you to exhaust every option of interaction before being allowed to progress forward.  The fantastic story is also strengthened by the clean comic book style of 1986 new york with a solid soundtrack complimenting Bigby's search for the truth.\n\nThere are occasional fighting sequences similar to Heavy Rain where Quick time events have to be completed lest Bigby take's a pounding that can have an effect on later events.  Decisions you make also feel like they have more impact on the narrative than TellTale's other titles as it does a better job of masking the transparency of keeping you to the critical path of the story.  Having a strong central objective and antagonist also makes each episode feel more cohesive than the Walking Dead.\n\nVoice acting is top notch as every snarky remark and desperate confession carries appropriate weight. Facial animations are much stronger than the Walking Dead with less rogue eyebrow movements and a stronger emphasis on subtlety.  The contrast between the idealized \u201chappily ever after\u201d fables and the miserable lives they're now living as supernatural beings with real world problems creates a truly engaging story.  There's something special about seeing characters like Beauty and the Beast having marital problems after a few hundred years and needing help to pay rent to maintain any grasp on the lives they once had.  While fables are generally told as children's stories they tend to be inherently dark and primal, the wolf among us isn't afraid to push further into the grit of old fables as adult themes, language and violence are common place.\n\nDialogue options are pretty satisfactory, there were only a few times I wasn't able to respond in a manner I felt would've been appropriate and piecing together evidence in a crime scene rewards the player by making relevant connections in dialogue afterward.  Each episode is generally around 2 hours in length and worth the price of admission.\n\nThe Wolf Among Us offers a much stronger interactive experience than the first season of the Walking Dead with a captivating story, engrossing characters and a much needed fix on pacing.  Bigby's investigation has plenty of twists and turns to keep players engaged in the on-goings of Fabletown with an original premise and a morally gray protagonist that allows every interaction regardless of how violent or generous to feel natural.  While it allows you tackle objectives in different ways from time to time, the story remains pretty linear without any true divergences occurring.  The overall outcomes are going to be similar regardless of what path you choose.  Still, changing the details, and Fabletown's perception of Bigby has it's own reward.  Anyone who's looking for a great story with action, humor, compassion, a talking pig and mystery should give the Wolf Among Us a try.\n\nDon't feel like reading all of this?

My first real experience with any of their recent games was last summer, when I played and enjoyed the first seasdon of their vision on [i]The Walking Dead[/i]. For the many gamers who've played either of these titles, the format of [i]The Wolf Among Us[/i] will come as no surprise: it's an episodic adventure game based on a comics book-series. But the setting is rather different: in [i]The Walking Dead[/i] people, be it good or bad ones, are set agaist the onslaught of a catastrophical zombie-apocalypse, which makes the player sympathize a lot (in my case anyway) with one or more of the people. [i]The Wolf Among Us[/i] is based on the Fables comic books, a modern-day twist on several figures out of children's stories or legends who were driven from their homelands and turned to live in New York, helped by some magic called \"glamours\" that makes them appear in a human form.\n\nThis setting may look like less \"dangerous\" at the first sight, but that's actually far from the truth. What starts out as a mature version of a story using some well-known fable characters (The Bid Bad Wolf aka The Sheriff is the you one play with), rather quickly turns into a grim, gritty adventure where nothing is what it seems and dangers looms large around every corner. Fabletown turns out not to be the safe-heaven everybody hopes for, but a harsh place in the middle of a rather coldish city dominated by the impersonal lights of neon-advertisements. Just like in [i]The Walking Dead[/i], actual gameplay is restricted to watching cutscenes (all of them very compellingly done) and interacting with other fables and objects. There is hardly any inventory to speak of and no puzzles: the main thing to do is to react to what is being said or happens. For this several options are given, and most of the time you have to choose your reaction within a limited timespan. This is so meticiouly done, that some decisions can be taken at leisure, while others need to be done in a split-second (just like in real life, probably).\n\nGameplay-wise, the one real difference compared to other Telltale-games lies in the amount of quick action-scenes. In these, players have to react quickly by pushing an indicated button on the gamepad (which I do recommend highly for this type of games). There are quite of lot of these \"events\"', maybe too many to some's likings, but for me they felt perfectly integrated. This is an action-filled world after-all, where violence seems to be omnipresent. As such, this game is definitely not for children: the violence can be very brutal and up-close.\n\nAs an example of how an original story can be interactively told in a game, [i]The Wolf Among Us[/i] succeeds magnificently. I did not feel the same amount of emotional interaction as in [i]The Walking Dead[/i], but the sheer tension and the detective-like feeling more than made up for that. This is another triumph for one of the best game developers currently active.\n\nGameplay: 27/30\nGraphics: 17/20 (Telltale's engine is very well suited to the film noir-feeling this game has)\nSound: 10/10 (the sound-effects and especially the music are top-notch and help so much to give the right atmosphere)\nTechnical/stability: 10/10 (smooth and stable to perfection)\nReplayability: 5/10 (when paying good attention, there is no need for a second play-through, but that's perfectly normal)\nSteam integration: 9/10 (no trading cards but in true Telltale-tradition a bunch of achievements that unlock as you progress, making it an easy-to-get 100% game)\nPersonal appreciation: 9/10\n\nOverall score: 87/100.\nWonderful game!", "timestamp_created": 1421520420, "timestamp_updated": 1421520459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826488375663757324", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106932046": {"recommendationid": "106932046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112321355", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1640567297}, "language": "english", "review": "You can kill British people", "timestamp_created": 1640897282, "timestamp_updated": 1640897282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825207710266113281", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42916003": {"recommendationid": "42916003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128350914", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 755, "last_played": 1648064739}, "language": "english", "review": "been 5 yrs waiting for season 2\n\nedit: 8 years now :)", "timestamp_created": 1529634918, "timestamp_updated": 1637810538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824357748031616211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39779092": {"recommendationid": "39779092", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999821810", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1435034011}, "language": "english", "review": "The only thing that bothers me about The Wolf Among Us is waiting so long for a damned sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1517527530, "timestamp_updated": 1517527530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822659134864807129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86869854": {"recommendationid": "86869854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363741087", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 486, "last_played": 1613557874}, "language": "english", "review": "I need the wolf among us 2", "timestamp_created": 1613557973, "timestamp_updated": 1613557973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820938348770141602", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39228168": {"recommendationid": "39228168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268140856", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 867, "last_played": 1515516508}, "language": "english", "review": "Just buy it and play it if you haven't already and remember:\n\nYou're not as bad as everyone says you are.", "timestamp_created": 1515580746, "timestamp_updated": 1515580746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.82062762975692749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13029180": {"recommendationid": "13029180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989212516", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1416505633}, "language": "english", "review": "No idea where to start with reviewing this game, so many positive things about it and very few negatives.\n\nI have been thinking about purchasing this game for a while now, being unsure if I would like it due to the fact that I disliked \"The Walking Dead\" games. Eventually, I made up my mind and purchased this game over the weekend and I do NOT regret purchasing it at all. Not played a GREAT game in years... Any of \"The Walking Dead Game\" fans out there will love this game since it follows the same style and it is made by the same developers I believe.\n\nThe Story was extremely interesting along with engaging, leaving you wanting more at the end of each episode due to the excellent Cliffhangers. It is a story that makes you think, even when you turn off the game and go on another game you are left thinking about it, because it is one of those games that has such an impacting and interesting story. All of the Characters were unique in their own way, there were those who you liked and there were those who you absolutely hated. Another thing I loved about this game was the amount of choices you got. If you disliked someone you could chose to act like a massive Asshole to them or beat the living crap out of them which is always satisfying. Unlike \"The Walking Dead\" where you aren't really fearing anyone, \"The Wolf Among Us\" has it so pretty much nearly EVERYONE fears you which I loved.\n\nAs for how the game looks, the game looks very unique and is rather cartoony/sketchy which I enjoyed very much, it gave the game a very unique look to it along with the type of colours that were used within it. The game runs very smoothly as well and I did not have any problems with it on my Computer.\n\nAs for replay value, I did go back and replay some Episodes in order to get 100% Achievements and I feel like playing through the game again but this time, acting like a jerk or choosing different routes, choosing who to beat up and who to trust etc.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about this game was that it was pretty short. There are FIVE episodes and all of them are roughly 1 Hour 30 Minutes long so I managed to complete it in roughly 6-7 hours with 100% Achievements. Hopefully if there is a Season 2 then there will be more to come (I do believe a Season 2 is being made).\n\nOverall it is just one of those games that you can't get enough of, I DO recommend buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1416590678, "timestamp_updated": 1416591019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818900942802429199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116361259": {"recommendationid": "116361259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109081495", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1657605597}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm upset that I underestimated this game for such a long time.

The story follows Bigby, the big bad wolf from Little Red Riding Hood but in his 'human form' working as a sheriff of Fabletown. The story is a murder mystery and your choices and answers to the characters around you will have an impact in the following episodes. I don't want to mention anything about the story to not spoil anything. I loved every part of it, especially the first episode which made me gasp multiple times. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083887457\n\nThe soundtracks of the game are amazing, I loved the intro theme song so much, the pace of the story is nice, the characters personalities are good and most of them are likable. I love the artwork style which Telltale Games are known for. Each episode can last to two hours, and after beating the game you'll be able to replay the chapters within the episode in case you've missed something or would like to try a different approach. You can shape your character's personality depends on your answers.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2085135751\n\nThe 'journal' you are having contains the characters you meet information and background. You also can pick items and you have inventory, however, in my playthrough, I found him rarely using those items I picked, not sure if I've missed something out. Also, you'll be given the choice to visit two or three places, you should choose wisely because the other place you decide not to visit first might have some evidence which will be destroyed, but as what I mentioned before you can always go back to the save file and choose the chapter again to check the alternative path. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2083890459\n\nPros:\n+Very interesting and well-written story.\n+Great soundtracks.\n+Well-done voice over.\n+Nice graphics.\n+Good animation and character design.\n+Choices and consequences.\n+High replay value. Has multiple endings and outcomes.\n+Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n- No manual save.\n\nI highly recommend this game to people who enjoy detective Noir, story-rich, and those who like Grimm fairy tale characters. I'm sure many people will enjoy this game. I can't wait for the second season.\n\n[i]Other Reviews:\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/330830?snr=1_5_9__402]Tales from the Borderlands Review[/url]\n[/i]\n\n[quote]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc50\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32399565/]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e'\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc36\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1589214018, "timestamp_updated": 1589214840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794977366924285889", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77498516": {"recommendationid": "77498516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132503739", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 514, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1602413513}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]My playtime:[/b] 9.4h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (5 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nDo you know [i]Little Red Riding Hood[/i]? [i]Three Little Pigs[/i]? [i]Snow White[/i]? or other fable stories? [i]The Wolf Among Us[/i] takes place sometime after those stories finished - well, their version of what happened in the story - where everyone moves to Fabletown, a town where all characters from fable stories live and hide their fable history from humans. You take control of The Big Bad Wolf, which is also known as Bigby Wolf in Fabletown, the only sheriff in town. A murder happens, and it's your job to solve it.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple choices that you can choose from that will affect some part of the story\n- Great camera angle and fighting scenes - it's as if you're watching a movie\n- Collectibles to learn more about the character's background\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- The game might be a bit confusing if you don't know about the story background at the start\n- No skip or fast-forward option to check the different story dialogues\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]Have you ever watched a movie and think something like \"If I were him, I would definitely do this\"? If yes, this is your game. You should buy this if you like to watch movies and violent fighting scenes in general too. It's not for children though because of several reasons, including the violent scenes.[/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nAlthough the game is in 3D, the game uses black outlines to give more details to the models, including muscles and forehead. This style works perfectly with the game setting that tends to happen at night since I could see everything perfectly. The animation is also super smooth and the details are superb; bloodstains in the clothes and bullet wounds in the body look exactly like what you'll expect, making it easier to immerse with the story.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nAs a game that focuses more on the story, this game doesn't disappoint. You might need to know some knowledge about the story and terms that everyone used, but you can always pause the game and read everything you need in \"Book of Fables\", a summary about the cast and anything of interest. However, this information doesn't tell about the original fable stories and you're expected to know about them beforehand.\n\nThe opening that shows up in every chapter looks cool and simple even though the main character is just walking and stopping. This is all thanks to the awesome music and camera angle that did all the hard work. The same can also be said about the story - although the music isn't as dominant, the camera angle and SFX on the fighting scenes help in making the scene to be more impactful.\n\nAlthough there are 5 chapters, the game keeps the suspense up until the last chapter. More characters and mysteries will be introduced as you progress the game and everything will be explained at the end. However, I found that the last scene, [spoiler]where the main character approach Nerissa[/spoiler], to be confusing.\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\n[b]Story Dialogues[/b]\nThe game has 5 chapters in total and each chapter is divided into 5 episodes. As I said before, the game is mainly filled with cutscenes; you just need to sit and watch as the story progress. A subtitle is also provided in the setting, although it's turned off by default.\n\nOftentimes, the game will give you 4 options to choose from within a time limit. Silence is a valid option; not choosing any option will assume that you agree with what the other people said. Some options will make the other party more or less fond of you, some are not. However, some options are not clear enough. There is this option that said \"Is that really everything?\" which I thought that the main character was questioning everything that the other person said - it turned out to be the opposite.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256695943 \n\nThe game will save your choices which might or might not impact some scenes. Your choices will carry over to the next chapter and episode although you still can redo your choices by making a save in a different slot. The game will then summarize your choices after you finished the last chapter. Strangely, you can play the last chapter without playing the previous chapters.\n\n[b]QTE[/b]\nQTEs will happen during violent scenes. You will have to either press a certain button, spam a certain button, or click on a spot with your mouse to land a hit. Failing to land a hit several times will cause a game over, where you can redo the scene from the start. The scenes might be too violent for some people though since it involves knife stabbing, ax chopping, or something similar. \n\n[b]Point-and-click[/b]\nThe game has a bit of point-and-click element in the game where you mainly have to inspect objects and/or choose your preference in opening a door, either by kicking, knocking, or opening it normally. However, sometimes it's hard to move since the perspective might change as you walk. Some areas are also hidden that you need to walk to a certain spot just to reach it and it's always mandatory to go to that place to inspect a certain item and progress the story.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2256695977 \n\n[b]Collectibles[/b]\nThe game offers a collectible in the form of \"Book of Fables\" entries, which can be obtained from either progressing the story or inspecting a certain object. These entries consist of a summary of the characters or anything of interest. It's important to read this to know more about the background of the characters although I felt that the game needs to give more details, especially on the main character's family which is original to the game.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nEach chapter takes ~2h to finish. You might also want to replay the game several times to see how each character will react if you choose different choices or simply just to get the optional achievements. However, there is no skip or fast-forward option for the cutscenes if you decide to replay the game to see other choices.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's a nice movie-like game where you need to watch a lot of cutscenes, do some QTEs, and inspect some objects in point-and-click style. The story is enjoyable, the graphics and animations are very detailed, and the music gives suspense to the story.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1602597930, "timestamp_updated": 1602600121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793573379516601563", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108004269": {"recommendationid": "108004269", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213309786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1641323857}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1642189516, "timestamp_updated": 1642189516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793144464492797852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110172530": {"recommendationid": "110172530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127316220", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 438, "last_played": 1648444718}, "language": "english", "review": "when the fable is sus \ud83d\ude33", "timestamp_created": 1644780085, "timestamp_updated": 1644780085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790401041507720947", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15471193": {"recommendationid": "15471193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016318428", "num_games_owned": 1064, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 731, "last_played": 1429691673}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to review this game but these lips are sealed.\n\n-Steam will remember that.", "timestamp_created": 1429579404, "timestamp_updated": 1429579404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 596, "votes_funny": 1104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79011911153793335", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39839084": {"recommendationid": "39839084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086611070", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 538, "last_played": 1517847694}, "language": "english", "review": "Some say \"The Walking Dead\" is the best series of Telltale games but for ME....well... \"The Wolf Among Us\" is the best telltale experience!

Everyone will have things they are not happy about and even rich and powerful have their pain, pressure and despair.\n\nThis was especially true for all the fairy tale character left their happy ending home land and went to the real-life New York to start anew.

Nothing pure white or black but only the shady gray. \n\nProbably the best interactive story I played so far but it\u2019s absolutely not for kids because of the mature subject matter. \n\nThere are nudity and violence with shocking image in this game.

Time to rectify that!\n\n[h1]Apply the usual Telltale Format[/h1]\n\nThe Wolf Among Us is an episodic game from Telltale; and follows their fairly tried and tested format of light point and click with QTE combat. I find the gameplay itself a little clunky and limiting and certainly not the strength of the game. The strength here is definitely the storytelling which I found extremely well written and engaging. \n\nIt is a dark retelling of some familiar fairy tales, where some memorable childhood characters are trapped in a dreary half-life, living under strict rules to protect the magical, terrified of being sent to \"the farm\". The Big Bad Wolf (Bigby) is the sheriff, investigating some brutal murders and unconvering piece by piece a conspiracy at the heart of the community. You can play Bigby as a cold-hearted cruel taskmaster, or a tortured good guy trying to atone.... or something in between. A realistic hybrid, a character with depth.\n\nIt's a crime-mystery storyline that pulls you in and drags you along at a good pace. Throw in a smidge of romance, a dollop of friendship and an awful lot of anger simmering beneath the surface and you've got a good drama brewing. It manages to be quite dark and emotional in places, whilst making me laugh in others. In short, it's a bloody good story.\n\n[h1]Pros: \u2611 \u2611 \u2611 [/h1] \n[list]\n[*] Gripping writing and unique storyline.\n[*] Believeable characters and good voice acting.\n[*] Dark aesthetic.\n[*] Choice of playstyles through dialogue.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons: \u2612 \u2612 \u2612 [/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Telltale's engine is dated and clunky.\n[*] The only action comes from QTE events.\n[*] The choices offer different dialogues, but ultimately aren't always meaningful.\n[*] A fairly short game, around 8 hours should complete it.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]This is my second favourite Telltale game, the first being The Walking Dead (Season One), so I'd definitely recommend it to those looking for an engaging and unique story.[/h1]\n\nP.S.

Episode 3 now seems to focus more on time, where to go first. Playing as Bigby gets more immersive due to the higher amount of more action, choices and of course, as ruined in the art, the wolf form. While only appearing once it really does show the image of Bigby letting go. So much so I went back and replayed that final scene 2 times to reach a consensus on the ending. \n\nThough only on its first episode, I think this will turn out to be a great game/episodes/series/whatever. The games has a very intriguing story which comes from a series of comic books, the characters are well written especially Toad. The art style is the same comic book feel as Telltale's other series/things The Walking dead. One thing that is really intresting comes with that there is no moral compas character like Clementime, which leaves all descisions to be almost made without direction.
