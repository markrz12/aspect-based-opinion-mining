Portal 2, the brainchild of Valve, is a masterclass in puzzle-solving, humor, and creativity that will leave you scratching your head and clutching your sides in laughter. So, let's dive into this Portal to discover why it's more than just a cake-filled lie.\n\nGameplay and Puzzles:\nPortal 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, throwing you back into the test chambers of Aperture Science like an unwilling lab rat. Armed with the iconic portal gun, you'll face an array of puzzles that will have you pondering like a philosopher in a think tank.\n\nThe puzzles in Portal 2 are as varied as a box of assorted chocolates. From ingenious tests of spatial reasoning to brain-bending platforming challenges, the game keeps you on your toes like a ballet dancer auditioning for a circus. It's like an exhilarating dance of portals, where each move is as precise as a surgeon's scalpel.\n\nBut fear not; if you ever find yourself stuck like a fly in honey, the solution is often simpler than a toddler's toy. The \"Aha!\" moments you experience after finally cracking a puzzle are as satisfying as pulling off a magic trick that leaves your audience in awe.\n\nNarrative and Humor:\nBeyond the puzzles, Portal 2 is a storytelling triumph that will captivate you like a bard's ballad. The game continues the saga of Chell and GLaDOS, the AI with a knack for dark humor and the occasional compliment. GLaDOS's snarky remarks are as sharp as a ninja's shuriken, and her wit will keep you entertained like a comedic duo on stage.\n\nThe game introduces new characters like Wheatley, a bumbling personality core with a penchant for bumbling and hilarious British charm. Wheatley's antics add a layer of levity to the experience, like adding sprinkles to an already delightful cupcake.\n\nThe narrative unfolds like a captivating novel, keeping you hooked from start to finish like a fish on a line. You'll find yourself emotionally invested in the fate of Chell and the Aperture Science facility, even as you laugh at GLaDOS's passive-aggressive remarks.\n\nCooperative Multiplayer:\nAh, but Portal 2's delights don't end there. The game boasts a cooperative multiplayer mode that's as delightful as having a partner in crime. Working together with a friend (or perhaps a friendly rival) to solve intricate puzzles and communicate through in-game gestures is as charming as watching a synchronized dance routine.\n\nThe cooperative puzzles require seamless teamwork and communication, which can lead to hilarious moments of miscommunication and botched portal placements. But remember, in the world of Portal 2, even the most disastrous mistakes can end in peals of laughter.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nPortal 2's visual design is as polished as a shiny new Aperture Science test chamber. The environments are a testament to the game's attention to detail, from the decaying ruins of the facility to the pristine test chambers that beckon you like a magician's invitation.\n\nThe sound design is equally impressive, with a captivating soundtrack that complements the gameplay like a well-timed drumbeat. The voice acting, particularly the performances of GLaDOS and Wheatley, is nothing short of stellar, deserving accolades like a standing ovation.\n\nChallenging and Rewarding:\nPortal 2 isn't afraid to challenge your intellect like a sparring match with a grandmaster. But fear not, for the game is as rewarding as a treasure chest filled with rare loot. Each puzzle you conquer feels like an intellectual victory, and the moments of revelation are as delightful as unwrapping a long-awaited gift.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Portal 2 is a sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but surpasses it in every way like a magician pulling off an awe-inspiring illusion. Its puzzles will twist your mind like a pretzel, and its humor will leave you in stitches like a comedy show.\n\nSo, if you're ready to embark on an adventure that's as intellectually stimulating as it is hilarious, enter the world of Portal 2. Whether you're a returning fan of the series or a newcomer to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, prepare to be captivated by the wit, charmed by the characters, and enthralled by the puzzles.\n\nGrab your portal gun, put on your thinking cap, and get ready for a mind-warping, side-splitting experience. Portal 2 is more than just a sequel; it's a comedic masterpiece of puzzle-solving, storytelling, and unforgettable moments. Now, let's open those portals and step through to a world of laughter and brain-teasing delight!", "timestamp_created": 1690308391, "timestamp_updated": 1690308391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795648813247680664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132382748": {"recommendationid": "132382748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879542603", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1691072519}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game ever made by humanity", "timestamp_created": 1675793452, "timestamp_updated": 1675793452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793206512928009033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125567360": {"recommendationid": "125567360", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033810977", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1668598766}, "language": "english", "review": "The song at the END was the Best Part.", "timestamp_created": 1668598730, "timestamp_updated": 1668598730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792974889278411865", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124756887": {"recommendationid": "124756887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311665988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1981, "last_played": 1689214400}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest games of all time.

There are many mods for the game that keep the community up and running like portal stories : Mel, portal reloaded and aperture Tag. There are also good mods in the making like Desolation with a dedicated team of modders behind it. I highly recommend you play this game as it's loads of fun. Even if puzzle games aren't your cup of tea they are not hard to overcome and every part in a chamber has something to do with the puzzle itself. There is also co-op mode and it offers even more content aswell as letting you play with your friends.

Its style of first-person physics-based puzzle gameplay was unique. GLaDOS, the murderous robotic villain, was new and vibrant and evil in the most charming way. Cake jokes and songs about surviving dismemberment were still hilarious. It was short, succinct and essential. Creating a sequel without playing all the same notes and making it feel like Portal: The Longer Version is a tough task. For Valve, it's apparently no problem.\nFrom the first moments of waking up in the rusting Aperture Science facility to right before the credits roll, Portal 2 rarely falters. The world is bigger, the story thicker, and the character development more surprising. The mania of GLaDOS, the facility's operator, is molded into unexpected forms alongside a host of brutally funny personalities. The history of the Aperture Science facility is filled in, character origins discussed, and though its pacing suffers as it occasionally strikes a more serious tone, an abundance of cruel jokes and cheerfully sincere death threats prevent it from losing its sarcastic charm. When you're not staring at your screen with wrinkled, pained expression on your face trying to figure out a puzzle, expect to be laughing.\nYou still play as Chell, dragged back into Aperture after the events of the first game. You soon meet Wheatley, a spherical robot, voiced by Stephen Merchant (The Ricky Gervais Show, Extras) who helps you through the early stages. It's difficult to overstate how Merchant's obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game. No word Wheatley speaks is without witty inflection, and the consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action. It's easy to be be just as concerned about missing lines of dialogue as about progressing through the puzzles, especially during Wheatley and GLaDOS' verbal sparring matches.", "timestamp_created": 1687047079, "timestamp_updated": 1687047079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722943484783172607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140238970": {"recommendationid": "140238970", "author": {"steamid": "76561199234205416", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1691890692}, "language": "english", "review": "I have +200 IQ", "timestamp_created": 1687034938, "timestamp_updated": 1687034938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721580862998962402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146233527": {"recommendationid": "146233527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414044638", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1034, "last_played": 1685999020}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83e\udd73Congratulations to Steam on its 20th anniversary and also players of amazing Portal\ud83c\udf89", "timestamp_created": 1694624223, "timestamp_updated": 1694624850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721352934837341309", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130624794": {"recommendationid": "130624794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425008900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1689072968}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont have the game", "timestamp_created": 1673429019, "timestamp_updated": 1673429019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720630407333374023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133786561": {"recommendationid": "133786561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006784111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1668128349}, "language": "english", "review": "All I can say about Portal 2 is that this game is absolutely fantastic!

There is an amazing amount of depth and complexity to the story that comes through the characters and the world itself. I was totally immersed in the story and often found myself deep in thought while navigating the different rooms.\n\nThe characters are also beautifully designed and developed. GLaDOS is a brilliant antagonist and Wheatley is a truly lovable character who often made me laugh and warmed my heart. And of course you shouldn't forget the highlight of the game: the ingenious game with the portal doors.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Portal 2 to anyone looking for a challenging yet addicting puzzle game.

Using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, also known as the Portal Gun, players can create portals to navigate through intricate test chambers. The combination of physics-based puzzles, momentum-based maneuvers, and the ability to manipulate space creates a truly mind-bending experience. Each level presents a new challenge, requiring logical thinking and creative problem-solving skills to progress.\n\n[h2]Clever and Humorous Writing[/h2]\nPortal 2 is renowned for its clever and humorous writing. The game introduces memorable characters like GLaDOS, the sarcastic and witty AI, and Wheatley, the bumbling but lovable personality core. The dialogue is filled with clever quips, dry humor, and unexpected twists, keeping players entertained and chuckling throughout the game. The sharp writing adds depth to the story and brings the characters to life, making them a joy to interact with.\n\n[h2]Rich and Immersive Environments[/h2]\nPortal 2 immerses players in a world of Aperture Science, with its dilapidated test chambers, hidden areas, and behind-the-scenes secrets. The attention to detail in the environment design is remarkable, from the worn-out surfaces to the subtle visual cues that guide players. The combination of sterile laboratory aesthetics and the overgrown, decaying sections of the facility create a visually striking contrast that adds to the game's atmosphere.\n\n[h2]Cooperative Multiplayer Mode[/h2]\nPortal 2 features a cooperative multiplayer mode that takes the mind-bending puzzles to new heights. Working together with a friend, players must collaborate and synchronize their actions to solve intricate puzzles. The cooperative mode introduces new challenges that require communication, teamwork, and precise timing, offering a unique and enjoyable multiplayer experience.\n\n[h2]Memorable Sound Design[/h2]\nThe sound design of Portal 2 is exceptional, contributing to the immersive experience. From the ambient background noises of the facility to the distinct sounds of portals opening and closing, the audio cues provide important feedback and create a sense of presence in the game world. The voice acting, including the iconic performance of GLaDOS, is outstanding, delivering lines with perfect timing and adding depth to the characters.\n\n[h2]Engaging Storyline[/h2]\nPortal 2 expands upon the intriguing narrative introduced in the first game. The story delves deeper into the history of Aperture Science, unraveling mysteries and providing new insights into the world. The combination of thought-provoking puzzles and a compelling storyline keeps players engaged and invested in the outcome, creating a truly immersive experience.\n\nIn summary, Portal 2 is a mind-bending puzzle adventure that combines innovative gameplay, clever writing, and immersive environments. With its challenging puzzles, memorable characters, and engaging storyline, the game captivates players from start to finish. Whether you're a fan of puzzle games or simply appreciate well-crafted experiences, Portal 2 is a must-play title that will test your wits and leave you craving for more.", "timestamp_created": 1685040072, "timestamp_updated": 1685040072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6882132887840271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136420486": {"recommendationid": "136420486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368257422", "num_games_owned": 1062, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 923, "last_played": 1642801140}, "language": "english", "review": "9", "timestamp_created": 1681057758, "timestamp_updated": 1681057758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687989234924316406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146318001": {"recommendationid": "146318001", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054693188", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2097, "last_played": 1656525058}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me gay", "timestamp_created": 1694756271, "timestamp_updated": 1694756271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700409770011901855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141620706": {"recommendationid": "141620706", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070369348", "num_games_owned": 698, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1674009751}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an absolute beast.\n\nI could sit down for hours and write about how great this game is.\n\nPortal 2 is a first person puzzle game in which you solve puzzles from room to room using your portal gun.\n\nThe portal gun allows you to shoot a beam into the floor, ceiling and wall, creating an entrance and an exit that your player may enter or exit.\n\nYou can walk around, jump and explore each of the levels.\n\nDefinitely have to try for yourself.. so much fun! \n\nYou can sometimes get this game on sale for 99 cents..

year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started playing Portal 2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1677741901, "timestamp_updated": 1677741901,

I didn't pay it much attention when it initially released, but it's significantly better than part 1. Both in terms of new puzzles and mechanics, some of them absolutely mind-melting; but especially in terms of the plot and characters. And surprisingly I only had to lookup one puzzle level (Chapter 8, puzzle 16 was a beast; not sure I could've made it through on my own).\n\nI especially loved how large and open the spaces were, and how puny you feel in a lot of the locations. And I also consider it a sign of good exploration and level design when I'm not sure I'm going the right way, and I'm not sure whether I broke the level and got to somewhere I wasn't supposed to. The portal gun is an absolute stroke of genius in terms of how versatile it is, both in exploration, level traversal and puzzle involvement in a vast multitude of ways.\n\nIt's now pretty obvious Portal 1 was a mix of a tech demo and some narrative context to it all, but Portal 2 just improves on everything, especially narrative-wise. And the two characters, Wheatley and GlaDOS, were an absolute blast to constantly hear interacting. But even separately they're significantly more humanized than in the first game. Such a fun duo. And such a good narrative arc to them both.\n\nI'm more mixed on the ending, I kinda wished it ended differently. This was the game I probably wished didn't end on such a sarcastic note. I really grew to like GlaDOS. Wheatley's ending was also hilarious. Just before the end, I just randomly clicked and the ending was triggered. And only then did I realize the lunacy of it. :D\n\nAnyway, I think I can easily grant the game a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1691435563, "timestamp_updated": 1691438050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589213132858276367", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133263227": {"recommendationid": "133263227", "author": {"steamid": "76561199343631785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1695339032}, "language": "english", "review": "everything idk why its just a fun game i mean i like the plot twists that it has", "timestamp_created": 1676936994, "timestamp_updated": 1676936994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588168144226074219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128338515": {"recommendationid": "128338515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199204468695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1628, "last_played": 1677025932}, "language": "english", "review": "Looking at the bad reviews again Squiddy?", "timestamp_created": 1670733240, "timestamp_updated": 1670733240, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587435126304626465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147158300": {"recommendationid": "147158300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833309812", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1048, "last_played": 1631762251}, "language": "english", "review": "you need WAAAAAAY more than 2 portals to beat this game, trust me i tried", "timestamp_created": 1695848898, "timestamp_updated": 1695848898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583815038204193115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125893651": {"recommendationid": "125893651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880237759", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1671256634}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with friends", "timestamp_created": 1669061517, "timestamp_updated": 1669061517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133219598": {"recommendationid": "133219598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276729704", "num_games_owned": 1172, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1676771327}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal is an interactive puzzle game.

The game is set in the Aperture Science Labs, where players must navigate through various test chambers using a portal gun that creates wormholes between two points.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Portal 2 is its storytelling. The game features a well-written and humorous script, with memorable characters like GLaDOS and Wheatley. The story is also cleverly intertwined with the gameplay, adding an extra layer of depth to the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are challenging but never feel unfair. The game gradually introduces new mechanics and concepts, allowing players to build upon their skills as they progress. The use of the portal gun adds a unique twist to the standard platforming formula, making for some truly mind-bending puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are stunning, with detailed environments and character models. The music and sound design are also top-notch, adding to the immersive experience.\n\nOne downside to Portal 2 is that it can be quite short, with only around 8-10 hours of gameplay. However, the game does offer a co-op mode that adds even more content and puzzles to solve.\n\nOverall, Portal 2 is a must-play game for fans of puzzle-platformers. It offers a unique and engaging experience that is both challenging and rewarding. If you're looking for a game that will test your problem-solving skills and keep you entertained from start to finish, give Portal 2 a try.", "timestamp_created": 1682088245, "timestamp_updated": 1682088245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564541220664978027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147020212": {"recommendationid": "147020212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294393467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3334, "last_played": 1638837790}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played this game on the PS3 and I played it till the disk could no longer be read.

K. Simmons), a nutty scientist pivotal to the backstory.\n- Can make your own test chambers and play other peoples', in doing so exploring another story, this time about parallel universes, all of which integrates nicely and cleverly with the Steam Workshop.\n- Very well-built from a technical standpoint; a surprising variety of off-the-shelf laptops from the early 2010s can handle Portal 2, managing 60 frames-per-second sometimes (or often, depending on your graphical preferences). Meanwhile, on gaming desktops from 2015 onwards, especially those with discrete graphics processors, you'd be laughing.\n- Robust controller support, via Steam Input. Not only does it change the keyboard icons to the controller's equivalents (e.g. changing the Space Bar to the A button), it natively supports a few controller-specific features, including the DualShock 4's light bar and the Steam Controller's haptic actuators. Valve went a few extra miles with that, it seems.\n\nWhat's not-so-good (or could've been better):\n\n- Can't modularise the installation (e.g. installing the single-player campaign while leaving out the multi-player campaign), which [i]might[/i] be concerning for players running low on storage space. [strike]Meanwhile, Microsoft Train Simulator's installer allows for unticking specific routes from being installed, proving that modular installation is doable.[/strike]\n- Not all of the supported languages have a corresponding voice track. I, for one, would've been interested to hear how Wheatley would sound in Japanese.\n- The bonus interactive teaser for Super 8 ends by trying to open what looks like a defunct webpage (which presumably would've been about the film) in Steam's in-game browser.\n- It doesn't look like the Sixense MotionPack DLC, nor the corresponding Razer Hydra, can be purchased anymore. You'd think Valve would at least attempt to preserve the former, whether with Steam Input's Joy-Con support or with VR controllers (including the ones for their [i]own[/i] Valve Index), but thus far\u2026nothing.\n- Even though Portal 2 supports rendering with Vulkan instead of DirectX 9, it cannot be activated from the video options menu; the -vulkan parameter must be entered into the game's launch options instead. Easily fixable, I'm sure.\n\nOverall, if you're into puzzle-platforming games, I recommend this one. There's plenty of variety and humour, and it's very well-built from a technical standpoint. You can tell that Valve put a lot of effort into the whole package overall, and I assume most players wouldn't particularly mind the drawbacks I mentioned.\nHowever, I strongly recommend playing [url=store.steampowered.com/app/400/]the original Portal[/url] beforehand; the single-player campaign will likely make a lot more sense as a result.", "timestamp_created": 1669159311, "timestamp_updated": 1669159311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125255452": {"recommendationid": "125255452", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970819557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1668099466}, "language": "english", "review": "Great puzzle game with a difficulty level that is not too easy and not too hard.

It will NOT seem mindless puzzles for ages and ages.\n\n- Characters: Wheatley, Glados, Catherine, and even the little Robot Turrets are all adorable and cute and have their own character about them. Love it!\n\nCONS:\n\n- Hard Puzzles: The Puzzles are not that hard but some had me stuck for a time, and that may be too much for some people who want a quick game and a story.

Portal 2 opens up more fun possibilities and gets you thinking creatively and feeling like a master problem solver. The puzzles are varied, keep you on your toes and are incredibly satisfying. \n\nMy personal favorite aspect of Portal 2 is the narrative; the storytelling is memorable and surprisingly has pockets of somber moments within the dark comedy backdrop. As for the multiplayer, some of my most cherished memories are from playing with friends in the co-op campaign. The miscommunications and accidents that happen add that much more to the joy of the game.\n\nLike with many Valve titles, Portal 2's art direction allows it to stand the test of time year after year. The framing and attention to detail make each screenshot of this game a work of fine art.\n\nSimply one of the best games ever made.

I have purchased this as a gift for others, because I believe that this is a must play game. I would even recommend this as a good introduction to people who do not normally play video games, due to the fact that the only skill requirement for the game is a mental one (you do not need great

Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that.[/h1]\n\nPortal is perfect. Valve's 2007 puzzle adventure \u2013 a short story about escape, in which the player must solve a series of spatial riddles with a gun that shoots doors \u2013 has a ruthless clarity to it, an economy of form and expression, that few games can match.\n\nIts creators took one fantastic idea and developed it exactly as far as it needed to go and no further. They teased you with a premise that mocks your status as a lab rat running through their devious maze. They gave that mockery a cool, cruel and bitterly dry voice in GLaDOS, the arch AI that keeps you company in the game's pristine prison cells.\n\nAnd then they lifted the curtain, just an inch, and let you look behind it. They almost surreptitiously slipped a neat parable of a story past you, sealing it with a punchline so resounding it knocks you back in your seat.\n\nYou can't call Portal heartless, it's far too funny a game for that, but it does have a heart of ice. It's so tight, so deliciously underplayed, that criticism passes through it like light refracted through a jewel.\n\nVery little of this is true of Portal 2. It would be impossible to expand that haiku of a game into a 10-hour blockbuster (with a separate co-operative campaign for two players) without muddying those crystal waters. Inevitably, it's more talkative, the humour is broader, it contains some ideas that don't work as reliably, and the fiction's delicate relationship with the Half-Life universe is disturbed.\n\nBut the sacrifices are worth it a thousand times over. Portal 2 is a riveting and hilarious entertainment. It has Uncharted 2's easy way with a one-liner or action set-piece married to the intricate brain-teasing logic of the best Zelda dungeons. (Far from insignificantly, it's also a major video game that involves virtually no combat.)\n \nAlthough its warped humour is miles away from Half-Life 2's oppressive tone, it is absolutely recognisable as that game's successor and equal, and thus the first full-scale Valve epic in over six years.\n\nThis is a new Valve, though, riffing on the cartoon comedy of Team Fortress 2 and the weathered B-movie pastiche of Left 4 Dead as well as its stock-in-trade cool sci-fi. That's clear from the opening, when you awake in a containment cell that's not an antiseptic glass cubicle but a simulacrum of a shabby 1970s-style motel room. The tutorial for the controls even contains a brilliant interactive gag at Valve's own expense.\n\nOnce again, you are Chell, the ponytailed woman in the orange jumpsuit who was GLaDOS's unwilling test subject in Portal. Many years later, a disaster appears to have befallen Aperture Science's labs and the clean white tiles of familiar test chambers are cracked and overgrown with vegetation.\n\nYou're woken from stasis by a chatty idiot of an AI called Wheatley, an expressive steel eyeball given verbal diarrhoea and an English West Country twang by Stephen Merchant (Ricky Gervais' writing partner on The Office). Wheatley begins as your guide and comic foil, a village-idiot version of Halo's 343 Guilty Spark.\n\nWhen your sardonic, deadpan tormentor GLaDOS is rebooted, a strange and darkly funny psychodrama starts to develop between these disembodied voices and your silent avatar. Another commentator joins this intimate cast during an unexpected second act, which parodies BioShock while shedding some light on Aperture's past \u2013 but I really should stop there.\n\nThe script, by Eric Wolpaw, Jay Pinkerton and Chet Faliszek, is a riot. It's both shameless and devastatingly successful in its pursuit of belly laughs as GLaDOS gradually lets her bone-dry quips slip into withering sarcasm and Wheatley does that Britcom blend of surreal nonsense, self-mocking blather and slapstick. Portal was a sequence of great jokes, but Portal 2 is that rare beast, an actual video game comedy \u2013 and one of the funniest ever.\n\nValve's animators should also take a bow. Without much warning, they have revealed themselves to be some of the best in the business, delivering work of exquisite, movie-quality detail and timing.\n\nTheir greatest achievements are the two robots players control in co-op: this mute comic duo is like a mechanical Laurel and Hardy brought to life by Pixar. But even the robotics of Aperture Science's test chambers are lent personality and character, moving between slick, synchronised spectacle and the involuntary, violent tics of a madman.\n\nValve's virtual architects have long had an extraordinary gift for pacing and environment design, and it's in full effect in Portal 2. Artful details guide you through the space and the story, or hint at untold tales. The functional puzzle chambers are still the meat of the game, of course, but they're broken up with spells of up-tempo action or quiet exploration that give the puzzles room to breathe.\n\nAnd those puzzles? There's nothing Valve can do to develop or perfect the first game's exploration of portals, whereby you use the two mouse buttons or triggers to 'fire' two doors onto certain surfaces, allowing you to teleport yourself and objects, or subvert the laws of physics and three-dimensional space to reach your goal.\n\nSo a number of new devices are introduced, the designers toying succinctly with each before moving on to the next. Sprung platforms called Aerial Faith Plates, and the Propulsion and Repulsion Gels that increase your running speed and jump height, are fairly standard-issue platform game mechanics given a great new lease of life by portals. Splattering gel like paint through cunningly-placed portals, or using portals to turn the faith plates into trampolines or orbital slingshots is a thrill that's both cerebral and visceral.\n\nBut the game's very best posers involve beams: laser switches, the Hard Light Bridge (a beamed platform) and the Excursion Funnel (a tractor beam that can pull or push you through the air). There's also a memorable moment of genius involving Conversion Gel, which allows you to apply portals to previously inert surfaces.\n\nIt's not until the very end of the game that Valve's designers dare to bring all these elements together \u2013 with gun turrets, cubes and switches, of course \u2013 in a mind-bending crescendo of ingenuity. Some chambers are vast, layered, cause-and-effect constructions that seem impossible before revealing a solution of such imagination, tactile satisfaction and devilish wit that you'll laugh as long and loud as you do at any of the jokes.\n\nIt's a shame it has to end, but it does, and unlike most games it ends very well, with a dumbfounding punchline and delightfully absurd coda. (Trying to recreate Still Alive in a new end-credits song was a mistake, though.) But Portal 2 is not over, because you can go on to enjoy several very happy hours of co-operative puzzling with a friend.\n\nCo-op presents the most natural and intellectually terrifying extension of Portal's puzzle-platforming lexicon: two more portals. But if you're worried that these will simply be too much for your brain to handle, don't be. This mode is the perfect proof of the old maxim that two heads are better than one.\n\nValve realised in testing that it could set the difficulty bar much higher for co-op simply because talking through a problem will lead you more quickly to its solution. The result is one of the most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend.\n\nPortal is perfect. Portal 2 is not. It's something better than that. It's human: hot-blooded, silly, poignant, irreverent, base, ingenious and loving. It's never less than a pure video game, but it's often more, and it will no doubt stand as one of the best entertainments in any medium at the end of this year.

I have completed the game first in year 2014 and have already forgotten a lot about it. But, after 8 long years of break I decided to play it again. And you know what? This title hasn\u2019t aged a day. The visuals and scripted events may not be as smooth as in modern titles, but occasional visual clunkiness provided by the Source engine is the literal worst that can happen. Given how well this game feels at 12 years old, I\u2019m willing to bet that it\u2019s still gonna rock at 30 and beyond. Seriously, do give it a try if you haven\u2019t already. It really is an instant classic that I can only praise.\n\n\n[h1]Thinking outside of the orange box[/h1]\nPortal, the original one, from the prehistoric era of year 2007 was stunning. It was a game like no other back then. But is Portal 2 equally good?\nThat\u2019s honestly a great question. In my opinion Portal 2 does what a good sequel should do. It takes a well-working formula and pushes its boundaries further and beyond. You can really tell that everything gameplay-related was taken a closer look at. Gameplay is smoother, camera movement is less stiff and motion-sickness inducing, the sound is designed to a perfection. Crazy stuff. And on top of that? You not only get more of the same, but tons of twists and turns on mechanics which used to be there in Portal one.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the sound though, cause I was very, very happy with it. Things I have noticed that made me smile from ear to ear were the evolving background noises, keeping with the story narrative on each section of the game. Sometimes repetitive, sometimes very unique and level-oriented, but all of the time\u2026 present. All the time adjusting to what is happening within\u2019 the game. It was even further improved with Gel levels, that I don\u2019t wanna spoil if you haven\u2019t played this title yet, but what you might want to know is that the sound becomes a bit louder and the progression tune is more and more audible the closer to the end you are. The closer you are to solving a puzzle, the happier the game is to encourage you with those. Absolutely fantastic.\nWorth of a separate mention is the work of the voice actors in this title. Ellen McLain, J.K. Simmons, Stephen Merchant and even Nolan North made this game a treat. Even if I was blindfolded it would be a title worth starting just to be able to listen to their respective characters saying things to me. Astounding performance that further enhanced this game\u2019s writing. Lovely job.\n\nVisuals are also not something that can be frowned upon. This game might be 12 years old now and I was still amazed by some of the sights placed in front of me. Giant praise to all of the level designers and story writers who made Portal 2 possible. One second, it can genuinely feel surreal only to bring you back to something that hits a tiny bit too close for comfort with how real world functions in the next one. And it fits the theme so well. I remember seeing the sign showing 2000 meters underground and thinking to myself \u201cHow fucking big is this facility?\u201d, only to be shown most of its expanse in the ending part of the game.\nI don\u2019t know how to describe it but I guess the feeling that I have would be best put as \u201cunease\u201d. The entire time you feel like the game is just a light, comedy-filled story about machines and their sterile approach to humanity and testing for science\u2019s best. Portal 2 doesn\u2019t really care. The tone of the story is so different from its actual content that it\u2019s scary. The jokes hide a dark and gloomy theme in which the humanity have failed and created machine-oriented environment that replaced all humans for the sake of science. \n\nSince I already touched on the story, let\u2019s quickly sum it up. It\u2019s great. To someone who never played Portal 2, the story might feel very distant at first. Difficult to understand and yet you can quickly settle in and just as you get nice and cozy, it starts hitting you with haymakers only. It throws in some plot twists and unexpected turns that you can see from miles away and yet they still manage to surprise you. It is all done to prove a point. That some things in life you can expect and some of them\u2026 are just impossible to see, even to the most experienced of minds.\n\n\n[h1]Thinking with portals\u2026 and more[/h1]\nOkay, but back to the most important question. I have praised the story, the visuals, audio and even the ideas behind this game. But is Portal Two worth it gameplay-wise?\nYou can bet your last dollar it is. It is pretty simple and yet can still be demanding. All you have to do is focus and think about how you should approach each problem individually. Because of course, the same logic can be applied to get you through multiple puzzles, but the actual solutions are varied and require you to\u2026 think differently.\nVALVe really had tons of ideas when creating POrTAl TwO and the clever potato joke is only one of them. If you had any experiences with Portal, they can help here, however there\u2019s still more to uncover. Repulsion gel, hard-light bridge or Excursion Funnel just to name a few additions. If you thought that you had Portal figured out, the second installment is here to prove you wrong. On the other hand, if you have never played this title\u2019s predecessor, you are in for a treat, because learning from the scratch is not only possible but also very pleasurable.\n\nAll in all, Portal 2 is all about learning. \nHow things operate? How to proceed? What exactly do I need to do? Where are all the things that I need? How would physics work if I did that? Where would I need a portal to reach this place? All that you need is a mind willing to learn and enough time to fail a couple (or a couple hundreds) of tries to finally figure out how to complete each challenge. \n\nPortal 2 is one of the best puzzle games that have ever existed, hands down. You\u2019ll need about 7 hours to complete the single player. There\u2019s also a separate co-op campaign available, adding another 7 hours to the tally, should you happen to have a friend or a stranger to play it with. \nThere\u2019s a lot to do. \nAnd I haven\u2019t even mentioned the Community Test Chambers in which, via little help of Steam Workshop, you can browse and go through countless of puzzles created by other players. It is literally impossible to be bored with Portal 2 and that\u2019s the highest praise I can give to a puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1683988888, "timestamp_updated": 1683988888, "voted_up":

Play the first game to be able to understand the story of Portal 2.\n\nThe story of Portal 2 takes place after the ending of Portal 1. You are now guided by the personality core \"Wheatley\" through the old test chambers to escape the facility, but you will experience a story with a lot of plottwists following.\n\nIf you have played the first game before, you'll be familiar with the mechanics of Portal. You have a portal gun and you have to solve several different puzzles on your way through the facility. Compared to the first game, the puzzles are more complex to solve from my personal experience. The overall good writing of the story, dialogues, cutscenes and voice acting made me continue playing the game no matter how difficult the puzzles were getting. I liked the atmosphere, the graphics are fine and it has aged pretty well. The controls were smooth and the music was capturing. The dark humor and plottwists made the game feel really exciting and I enjoyed it pretty much.\n\nMy conclusion: If you liked the first game and you want to experience a worthy sequel of the first game, you won't regret it!", "timestamp_created": 1679414299, "timestamp_updated": 1679414299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135103605": {"recommendationid": "135103605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260329726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1680654506}, "language": "english", "review": "Supremely goated game\nValve's best", "timestamp_created": 1679410221, "timestamp_updated": 1679410221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135086973": {"recommendationid": "135086973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980402383", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 855, "last_played": 1692204515}, "language": "english", "review": "Finds the limits of your brain.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1679393333, "timestamp_updated": 1679393333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135067490": {"recommendationid": "135067490", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446298574", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 775, "last_played": 1688883027}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was amazing. it has great story great personality over all great game. i hugely recommend this game", "timestamp_created": 1679357233, "timestamp_updated": 1679357233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135051536": {"recommendationid": "135051536", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997640953", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1694870647}, "language": "english", "review": "HONEST REVIEW\n\nStory\n------------------\nJust a story game \u2610\nA customizable story game \u2610\nStory but theres a sandbox \u2610\nstory and sandbox X\nstory is there if you want it \u2610\nSTORY?

The story is very entertaining to watch unfold and the beginning test chambers are the old chambers from Portal 1 which gives old players a sense of something being familiar while also letting new players get the hang of Portal. The new lore added to the later chapters makes the game way more breathtaking. The new features added make the game way funner and lets you think outside the box to finish the later test chambers. I would recommend this game to people who have played Portal 1 and want a harder game, and if you haven't, you should also play Portal 1, it's a great game and a easier one than Portal 2.

is the root of a country? What is true patriotism? The quality of life of the people in the country's territory is the root of the country. Only those who really safeguard the good life and fight against harm are called true patriots. Three year olds should know that life is better when there are fewer harm. Therefore, harm only means worse life, and fight against harm will make life better\n\nAny statement or thing that is not factually verified is not fundamentally different from the nonsense of the madman on the street, so it is not credible at all. Smart people only believe things or statements that are factually verified\n\n\nFor example, the Chinese government always publicizes that it is the public servant of the people. However, expired turkey noodles can be sold nationwide through China's food safety regulatory review, and they are not investigated and dealt with until they have been sold for a long time. A problem that is believed to be found by children three years old, but the food safety regulatory department of the Chinese government cannot find that the food is expired, This fact is enough to prove that the Chinese government does not care about the food safety of its citizens at all, and it also fully proves that the Chinese government's statement that it is a public servant of the people is a lie. As it said above, to cause harm is only to worsen life and to counter harm is to maintain a better life, and to allow expired food sales by the Chinese government is to connive at the harm, so the Chinese government is not protecting the good life of its citizens, It is deteriorating the quality of life of the people. In addition, the fact that the Chinese government publicizes that it is the public servant of the people, but the fact that it allows the sale of expired food through the Chinese government is enough to prove that the statement that it is the public servant of the people is a lie. Therefore, the truth can be learned after any thing or statement is verified by facts. Moreover, the Chinese government's various blocking and blocking systems and measures against the Internet and news are also obviously forcing people to interfere in their freedom of speech and not let them reveal the truth. You should know that facts are better than eloquence. How can you be afraid of the truth when you do it right? Therefore, only those who cannot stand on the facts and fear the facts will be afraid of facing the facts", "timestamp_created": 1671767484, "timestamp_updated": 1671767484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129052616": {"recommendationid": "129052616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409328756", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1676253122}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, do you even need my review?

Portal 2 has been the soul purpose in the downfall of my life as I knew it. I am 45 and have been married for 20 years. My wife and I had 4 kids and one more on the way. I try to have some me time when I can so I booted up the good old steam and looked for some games to play. I went to see what games were on sale and saw Portal 2. Hearing good things about this game in the past I had purchased the game for what seemed like a great deal. It was not a great deal. The $1.06 I payed for this game has separated my whole family apart and its all my fault. It started when I first opened the game to the extremely loud Valve intro music if you can even call it music. This clearly caused some frustration to me and my old ears. After turning the volume down to reasonable level I started my single player adventure. The adventure starts in a bedroom which starts shaking and falling apart representing the failing economy and infrastructure in the near future. This scene ends where you jump from an unlivable fall considering that I am still human in the intro. After this is where my anger and frustration grew immensely. So a little background I have never been good at puzzle games and caused me great trouble especially as a child. I figured since a lot of time has passed and I have grown mentally this game would be easy as ABC. I was doing fine at first until this bully robot starts talking. This demon started harassing me! I started yelling back at the robot because it reminded me of being bullied as a kid. The yelling woke up 2 of my kids on the other side of the wall. My wife then proceeded to come in my room and asked \"What's wrong?\". After explaining to her that this ball and this voice were bullying me and calling out my childhood trauma she told me to calm down and try ignoring it.\nShe left the room and I continued playing. The robots and I did not get along. I don't remember the exact details so I apologize but I'll keep it brief. The robots got to me on a level that ticked me off enough to the point were I punched my monitor with all my force. Following the obliteration of my monitor I followed through and threw my personal computer (PC) out my window. Little was I aware that our dog was outside and the 20 pound chunk of metal landed promptly on his back putting him out cold. My wife heard me in her words \"going crazy\" and grew concerned. After I tried explaining everything to her she made it clear that she needed some air. Leaving the front door she sees the dog. I have no words as my wife yells at me I pack my bags and run away. It's been 2 years and I have no intent of going back.

Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the game, but not because it was too difficult, I'm not the type of person to give up, especially on games with major difficulty. Although I gave up the game for quite a long time. I saw that Nvidia wants to make a Remastered game, adding the RTX setting to the game, which makes it look splendid. It's a pity that another game was not released, but as far as I know Valve is, I certainly don't think that another game with such a great reputation will appear in front of us. A very difficult game to play, but at the same time very difficult to do the puzzles. It's very good, and the idea of \u200b\u200bthe portal is something that if Valve didn't think about it, the chances were very small that someone would come up with such a good idea.\n\nBonus: Don't play the game when you're drunk or on drugs because you don't understand anything anymore.

[/h1]\n\n Portal 2 is a legendary game for me, because it was an unusual game for me. As a matter of fact, I started playing Portal series from the second part, I remember by heart how to pass all the single-player chambers. In general, the game for me is a road that takes me back to my childhood.\n\n[h1] The story part. [/h1]\n\n[spoiler] The single player storyline comes right after the events of the first part of the game. Our main character has been in stasis for months, years, centuries (I don't know exactly). Many years later, Chell awakens again, and the narrator informs her that she was in a dream \"9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9\". Chell meets Wheatley for the first time, learning that the reserve power has run out and the reactor core will melt down. Wheatley is about to make his escape, afraid his superiors will blame it on him. He punches a hole in the wall with his camera and tells Chell to find the \"cannon that makes holes.\" After Chell goes through some tests in the ruined Aperture Science complex, Wheatley accidentally turns on GLaDOS. From this point, the typical Portal 1 returns, but this game is a head, no, five heads above its predecessor in terms of puzzles. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Gameplay. [/h1]\n\n Portal is a puzzle game, in this game you need to show maximum attention to any details, because they can be your pass to the next level. \n\n Also the main feature of the second part is a co-op mode. And instead of 2 portals from the single-player game, you will have 4. Be prepared for the fact that one of you will only think how to apply those 4 portals to pass the test.\n\n[h1] Bottom line. [/h1]\n\n The game is good, to this day looks pretty, and in places beautiful. I advise to pass it with your dickhead friend.", "timestamp_created": 1680935853, "timestamp_updated": 1685853663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

You have to progress through test chambers to get the portal gun. After you drop to the incenerator room and finish it you will get another portal gun and you will unlock all 2 portals. Then you will be able to shoot the orange and the blue portal at the same time. GLaDOS says that you will go through a lot of chambers. After all of those chambers. You get to chapter 3. Chapter 3 is like something that wasnt from Portal 1. You start to see a faith plate. That is a part of Chapter 3. After all of those Chapter 3 chambers. You get to Chapter 4 as The Suprise. Then after all of the chapter 4 chambers you go to Chapter 5 known as the The Escape. Once you get to the facility of GLaDOS's you plug wheatley into some stick thing. Then Wheatley becomes GLaDOS instead. And he pushes you into a very long pit by punching the elevator very hard that you fall. Good thing you had the long fall boots. You couldnt fall in 1 foot or 2 foot. Except you fell in water and you're still alive. Because it's not over, you see yourself doing tests in the underground. After the tests you head into the wheatley's tests that some are easy some are really hard. After those too you now meet up with his death traps. But you survive the traps with everything you knew like the Replusion Gel or the Proplusion Gel or the Conversion Gel and then you meet up with him in his facility while there's fire outside of the facility and you plug the first core called Space Core while he sends bombs at you you fire more bombs at him by using your portals. And then you plug the very adventerous core called Adventure or Rick Core. And then the last few bombs and then you get the Fact Core. You plug the very last 3rd core at Wheatley and then you press the button that is blocked by Grating barriers. But then the button explodes while the facility crumbles down to bits.

Even if story and design weren't as good as in Portal 1, they were still quite enjoyable. Even more game mechanics were introduced and I thoroughly enjoyed them, but the game seemed to end just as things began to get interesting and challenging. This is quite a short game, it took me 9 hours to complete the campaign, but Portal 1 only took 3 hours.\n\nNow player-made levels and co-operative playing is possible, too.

puzzle-platformer developed by Valve Corporation and released in 2011. It is the sequel to the popular game Portal, which was released in 2007. I have been a fan of the series for a long time, so I was excited to finally get a chance to play Portal 2.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nThe gameplay in Portal 2 involves solving puzzles using the \"portal gun,\" which allows the player to create portals on certain surfaces. These portals can be used to move objects and the player character through space in creative ways. The controls for the portal gun feel very responsive and intuitive, and the puzzles are challenging but not frustrating. One of the standout features of the gameplay is the use of physics-based puzzles, which require the player to think creatively and use their knowledge of physics to solve them. I did not encounter any bugs or glitches during my playthrough.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nWithout giving away any major spoilers, the story of Portal 2 follows the player character, Chell, as she tries to escape from the Aperture Science facility and confront the artificial intelligence GLaDOS, who was the main antagonist of the first game. The characters in the story are well-written and have interesting motivations, and the dialogue is often humorous and clever. The pacing of the story is well-done, with a good balance of action, puzzle-solving, and character development.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]\nThe graphics in Portal 2 are top-notch, with detailed environments and character models. The visual style is a bit dark and moody, which fits the atmosphere of the game well. I did not experience any issues with frame rate or resolution during my playthrough. The sound design is also excellent, with a great soundtrack and excellent voice acting, particularly for the character of GLaDOS.\n\n[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]\nPortal 2 has a lot of replay value, with multiple endings, unlockable content, and a cooperative multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode adds an entirely new dimension to the gameplay, as players have to work together to solve puzzles. I would definitely recommend the game to others based on its replay value.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nOverall, I was very impressed with Portal 2. The gameplay is challenging and innovative, the story is engaging and well-written, and the graphics and sound are top-notch. The replay value is also high, with multiple endings and a cooperative multiplayer mode. I highly recommend Portal 2 to fans of puzzle games and anyone looking for a unique and memorable gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1672789330, "timestamp_updated": 1672789422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128071206": {"recommendationid": "128071206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109627387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 360, "last_played": 1676270866}, "language": "english", "review": ":] portal", "timestamp_created": 1670370171, "timestamp_updated": 1670370171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127819743": {"recommendationid": "127819743", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067365160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1686386072}, "language": "english", "review": ":[", "timestamp_created": 1670052822, "timestamp_updated": 1670052822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515723288059234619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139109736": {"recommendationid": "139109736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972447381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1685220826}, "language": "english", "review": "After watching so many side content and speculations when it comes to this game I decided to finally play it!

heat.

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n\n    Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n\n    Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The simple fact that you're standing here listening to me means you've made a glorious contribution to science[/h1]\n\nPortal 2 is the one of the greatest games I\u2019ve played and this is actually coming from a person who doesn\u2019t even like platformers and puzzle games. Portal 2 is equivalent to [b]T2: Judgement Day[/b] when it comes to rating sequels. I\u2019ve refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and I regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+The developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot. \n+Well written and memorable story and dialogues. Pacing is also well done. \n+Best voice acting in a puzzle game. I seriously can\u2019t think of any game topping this. \n+[b]Stephen Merchant[/b] and [b]J.K Simmons[/b] did an absolutely terrific job. [b]Ellen McLain\u2019s[/b] performance as GladOS is so good that you\u2019ll love to hate her character. So, then it\u2019s a success I guess :D\n+Portal 2 has a humor like no other game. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s dark but most importantly it\u2019s original!\n+Gameplay is fun, addictive and educational. No matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original Portal which was a lot frustrating at times. \n+Performance is flawless. It was so smooth like as if Valve built Source just to make this game. \n+Excellent soundtrack and musical score by [b]Mike Morasky[/b] and [b]The National[/b]. \n+Two player co-op campaign is equally fun as single player mode. Very well-designed levels and actually requires co-operation and trust of your friend. \n+User created levels and mods are very impressive. Shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels. It was fun playing. Check them out once you\u2019re done with the main story. \n+Nice and clean graphics. Aged very well even though it\u2019s almost a decade old game. Visually this perhaps the best-looking game from Valve imo. \n+Suitable for all ages, no matter whether you\u2019re young or old, Portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard. There\u2019s also a PS3 port available with PS Move support.\n+Credit to Valve for providing soundtrack for free.\n+Excellent port. Also supports Linux and Mac so no one is really missed. \n+Steam Cloud saving, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Official mod support. \n+One of the greatest video game endings. So many great and ambitious and big budget AAA games have fulfilling gameplay, story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or don\u2019t meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in. Not Portal 2. It manages to be fun from start to finish line. \n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n-First part of the story can be a little predictable if you\u2019ve watched a lot of movies and TV.\n-Most assets seem like they\u2019re copied straight from previous Valve\u2019s works like the first Portal, Half Life 2 and its standalone episodes. \n-Honestly, I\u2019ve tried hard to find and couldn\u2019t. At this point I\u2019m just nitpicking Valve.  \n\n[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1]\nPortal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype. You might think it is overrated but there\u2019s only one way to find out. Just get the game and first thing, play the game already! Portal 2 is one of the funniest, best written game of all time. Stephen Merchant as Wheatley and J.K Simmons as Cave Johnson; perfect casting. Valve never disappoints, (or at least never did a decade ago or so). Portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and I\u2019m thankful for that.\n\nThe developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game Narbacular Drop. Valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make Portal. You can check that game out for free by visiting their website.

Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them!\n-------------------------------\n[b]Intro[/b]\nYou know how when you are on vacation and say, \"I am so glad it isn't winter right now.\"? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Summary:[/b]\nThis game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programmed-to-be \"idiot\" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play. \n-------------------------------\n[b]Multi-Player[/b]\nThen there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totally worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/load-outs into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/mental abilities.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Other important things[/b]\nThe many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the story-line, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.\n\nTo dumb it down:\n-------------------------------\n[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]\n+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful game-play. \n+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience. \n+Well-designed maps and challenges. \n+Unlimited maps (user-created). \n+Fantastic story-line. \n+Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials). \n+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable.\n+Gender neutral.\n[u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u].\n-------------------------------\n[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]\n-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1). \n-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].)\n-Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.) \n-Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.)\n-------------------------------\n[b]My opinionated review[/b]\nI would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Rating[/b]\nOut of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing \"Portal transportation\" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definitely get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating.\n-------------------------------\n[b]Finally[/b]\nThanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!\n~thedubmark\n(I write reviews now :))", "timestamp_created": 1424592159, "timestamp_updated": 1593180411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 343, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.933511197566986084", "comment_count": 44, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39743506": {"recommendationid": "39743506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290867364", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1580, "last_played": 1535282845}, "language": "english", "review": "Everyone Is Waiting For Half Life 3 While I'm Waiting For Portal 3\n\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1517389516, "timestamp_updated": 1517389516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 173, "votes_funny": 84, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930705666542053223", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7770987": {"recommendationid": "7770987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007921819", "num_games_owned": 1464, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3309, "last_played": 1653088536}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game ever made by Valve.

My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly. \n\nThe campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens.\nThen, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on.\nAnd, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.\n\nAll in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will.

I will talk about the most striking things for me during my playtime and some thoughts about it.\n\n[list]\n\n [*]  [u] [b] Storyline [/b] [/u] \u2013 The Story has improved a lot since the first game, there is now a more noticeable narrative, between the Old Villain (Glados), a new character (Whitley) and the playable character (Chell). There is also a lot from the Origin of the Aperture Science, making it an interesting and solid game to go through.\n [*]  [u] [b] Challenging and Mechanics [/b] [/u] \u2013 The game has a base mechanic, the Portal Gun, a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through\u2026 It might be simple, but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters, making it a lot more Challenging as you go further in the game.\n [*]  [u] [b] Comedy [/b] [/u] \u2013 This game is Hilarious, not only from the well written jokes spoken by  the characters, but the environment has some hidden details that are so funny as well, I would definitely recommend you to read the plaques and frames around the map.\n [*]  [u] [b] Aged like Wine [/b] [/u] \u2013 Portal 2 was released in April of 2011, back then it was revolutionary, it was a brand new game with new features and mechanics, today, it is not much different, the Graphics is fairly decent and the game still unique.

We all know this game with its puzzles and mechanics is a masterpiece - but there is far more to it imo! Last year I cooped the game with a guy I had in my steam friends list for about 6 years. The coop was so nice and entertaining that we decided to meet in RL. And it turned out that RL teamwork was just as awesome as our in-game coop.

That\u2019s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.\n\n\u3000STILL ALIVE?\n\n\u3000\u3000The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.\n\n\u3000ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER\n\n\u3000\u3000One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.\n\n\u3000ENDLESS TESTS\n\n\u3000\u3000In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.\n\n\u3000Multiplayer:\n\u3000\u3000Online: \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \u0398 \n\u3000\u3000Co-op:    \u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263aO\n\u3000Storyline:   \u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263aO\n\u3000Graphics:   \u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263aO\n\u3000Gameplay: \u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\u263a\n\n\u3000\n\n\u3000Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.\n\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000[i]VALVe made another good\n\u3000\u3000game.

I can't believe how such simple puzzles are presented so well that the game leaves such impression.\n\nThe whole gameplay is solving puzzles by using portals you can travel through. You can shoot up to two portals \u2013 one being entrance and another one is where you exit after entering the first one. Pretty simple heh? So what's so special about this game? Well, EVERYTHING! The level design is outstanding, there's no repetitiveness, you'll never be bored and puzzles itself are well thought. Some will be easy and some will be tougher to solve but they are done in such a manner that neither of them are too hard to frustrate you and it feels rewarding when you finally got it right.\n\nThere are also parts where you just walk and even that is filled with GLaDOS talking to you to keep you entertained. The areas you travel through are also beautiful and interesting to look at. Oh GlaDOS is not just talking, it will make you laugh too. Whenever you start feeling that the game might become boring you suddenly get GlaDOS say something or you just solve the puzzle. The pacing and great.\nThere's also coop mode but i haven't played it so can't comment on it.\n\nGraphically it looks great even though it's a pretty old game by now but everything is pleasing to your eye. Areas are more diverse than in the first game and you see less repetitive patterns.\n\nSound starting with music and ending with GlaDOS is amazing. It just makes the whole game complete. Every sound, every word, every note of music, every ambient sound are in their places at the right time.\n\nThis is probably a puzzle masterpiece worth playing even if you're not a fan of puzzle games (i'm not). I can't recommend this game enough, it's must play.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Great puzzles\n[*]Great level design\n[*]GlaDOS\n[*]Great sound design\n[*]Good graphics\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]-\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1620071474, "timestamp_updated": 1620071474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.865076959133148193", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56649625": {"recommendationid": "56649625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115373356", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 3539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3357, "last_played": 1600546759}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, how can you call yourself a gamer if you haven't played Portal by now?", "timestamp_created": 1573069804, "timestamp_updated": 1573069804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 159, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864624261856079102", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12783865": {"recommendationid": "12783865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122488806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1277, "last_played": 1654956794}, "language": "english", "review": "Take everything you love about Portal, then times it by five.

Witty dialouge, excellent voice work, a really cool soundtrack, and even something as simple as the sounds that the portal gun makes sound awesome!\n\nGameplay? Addictive.\n\nStory? Really good. There are some parts to the story where I genuinely felt threatened and isolated. \n\nGraphics? Nothing to complain about.\n\nAlthough Portal 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games I've played in a while, there are two errors that I find with it:\n\n#1 There are parts in the game where you have to use the \"zoom\" key to find almost unfindable portable surfaces. I thought this gameplay mechanic was rather silly and annoying.\n\n#2 There are parts in the game where the events that happen don't make much sense, and you wonder why you have to do certain things or why you're in certain places.\n\nOverall this game is one of the best games of our generation, and it's loads of fun.
