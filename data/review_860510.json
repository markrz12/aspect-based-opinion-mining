Yes, it is true that the game is still a bit short and after its 3-4 hour experience, it is not worth repeating much, but to be honest, in this relatively short time, it fulfills its mission to entertain the audience in an almost ideal way.\n\nLittle Nightmares 2, on the one hand, has a really good story, and by depicting the relationship between Mono and Six, as well as using valuable references and concepts, it narrates it very well, and in terms of gameplay, we see a scary experience with mostly well-designed puzzles. They have and you can enjoy the platformer aspects and even the fights and chases a lot.\n\nEven the existing problems of the game are not so big and impressive that they hit it much.

These frustrating changes definitely did not seem intentional but rather the product of the developers working themselves into a corner and needing to break the rules to force their way back out. These made me RAGE so hard. Some examples below (spoilers):\n\n    1. The timing on swinging the hammer to smash the porcelain doll enemies specifically when they are aggro'd felt pretty shit. It was fine when you're sneaking up on them or battling 1-2 at a time but there's one sequence that I died to a couple dozen times because you literally have to die over and over until you have the sequence perfectly memorized.\n    2. Occasionally your character jumps MUCH higher and farther because the game just needs him to. So you'll be stuck on a puzzle thinking \"Well I definitely can't reach that\" but nope... Your jump is just conveniently 20% longer/higher but only for this jump because the game needs it to be. Just give me an extra platform to jump on or a bridge to push over in these situations instead of CHANGING how the game handles.\n    3. The fucking elevator \"puzzle\" at the start of the 3rd act. I raged about this on stream for like 30 whole minutes but basically the game shows you two thresholds your character can pass through to complete the last part of the elevator puzzle except... Nope! One of those thresholds is just an invisible wall! Even though literally one minute prior there's a different threshold that looks IDENTICAL to this one and you CAN pass through that one.\n    4. Controlling the flashlight with the right stick while moving with the left stick was just awful. And it's especially frustrating because I loved the design and idea of the area where you have to use the flashlight but the controls on this section were genuinely some of the worst I've encountered in years.\n\nDespite these, I strongly recommend this game to all horror fans. I LOVED everything about this experience excluding these 4 points of rage. I'd be very curious to watch someone else play through this game and see how much of my complaints are valid and how much are just because my brain is dumb. I did watch another stream get stuck on my #1 bullet point and she had the EXACT same problem I did so I don't think it's on the player.\n\nNARRATIVE & WRITING: 8/10\nGRAPHICS, SOUND & ART: 9/10\nGAMEPLAY: 5/10\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1668801630, "timestamp_updated": 1668801930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700696051120758057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135006177": {"recommendationid": "135006177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074973053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 330, "last_played": 1679277437}, "language": "english", "review": "The little nightmares games are fun, and i would recommend them to anyone who likes the ambiance and artstyle, yet i cant help but think it is lacking.\n\nThe 2.5D playstyle is fun, yet the gameplay and mechanics can be unforgiving and sometimes frustrating. i.e did you slide .25 seconds to late? cool, restart and do the whole sequence again. same with aiming attacks.\n\ni think its a great game. but it loses alot of its horror and creep factor when you have to do the same sequence 10x after failing so much because the gameplay itself can be unforgiving, and the controls dont lend themselves to this type of accuracy and demand of split second reaction accuracy.

They both have:\n[list]\n    [*]Gorgeous 10/10 art direction,\n    [*]Beautiful music,\n    [*]Phenomenal level design,\n    [*]Fantastic lore, etc.\n[/list]\nBut where the two games are vastly different is how [b]sudden and frequent[/b] dying/restarting is in this installment (and honestly some of the first game's DLC as well).\n\nLittle Nightmares 2 is incredibly lethal, with insta-death enemies everywhere, insta-kill traps well hidden, and super tight platforming which allows for no mistakes. This is all very challenging and fun, but it is fatally [i]antithetical to capital-h Horror[/i] as a genre.\n\nAs it is, Little Nightmares 2 is an [i]action-packed mystery and exploration game[/i]. Such games can be [b]awesome[/b], but that does not make them [b]Horror[/b]. Even if they have spooky looking bad guys, the player doesn't feel that creeping doom and dreadful chill grip your heart while playing them.\n\n[u]Here's my proposed reason why:[/u]\n\nHorror as a genre absolutely requires [b]deep immersion[/b]. You need to lose yourself in the screen, totally forget the room around your monitor, and become one with your character. When making a terrible discovery about the world, you need to be [b]seriously engrossed[/b] to feel the creeping Horror in the depths of your soul.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the fastest possible way to [b]lose immersion[/b] is to [b]die and start a scene over.[/b]\n\nIt is to be reminded it's all a video game suddenly and violently. To re-face the same monster, to be chased down the same hallway, or to re-make the same discovery over and over again, becoming familiar with it and learning to master it. [b]This erases all the tension built up for the scene.[/b]\n\nThese things obliterate immersion, and with it, the slithering feeling of Horror like the first game had.\n\nLittle Nightmares 1 could be beaten entirely with only a tiny handful of deaths. You had lots of time to be [b]immersed[/b]. When things went wrong, you had room to panic, spot a solution, and fix it [b]before you died[/b].\n\nYou stayed in your character's head more, and [b]stayed \"in the zone\"[/b] to be truly horrified by what was happening around you in The Maw.\n\nLittle Nightmares 2 is a bit of a skill-issue grindfest. Every monster moves lightning fast and kills you instantly at longer ranges. Traps delete you if you step one pixel out of line. Chase sequences have zero room for error so you'll always re-do them multiple times, [b]completely destroying any drama the game built up for the chase.[/b] It forces you to win the game through rote memorization, which ruins both immersion and horror (but can still be fun! I want to stress that fact).\n\nWhile this level of challenge is certainly satisfying in other games, it's a very different genre and \"feel\" than what Little Nightmares should be, and it suffers for that.", "timestamp_created": 1679002543, "timestamp_updated": 1679002792, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635384261608123779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142784717": {"recommendationid": "142784717", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260983723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 759, "playtime_at_review": 1084, "last_played": 1696073924}, "language": "english", "review": "i love the dark grim atmosphere of the game SO much. it really gives the feeling of a nightmare and fear without being gory or psychotic, the game-play is amazing really a 10 out of 10 experience even for a low end PC user like myself", "timestamp_created": 1690309401, "timestamp_updated": 1690309401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63493800163269043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124210132": {"recommendationid": "124210132", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123493057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1691231968}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls are an absolute joke.

The environment, the enemies and the ambience were all fantastic. The story was cool as well. Anything in the game besides the controls was great.\n\nWhen you launch the game it specifically says that playing on the controller is recommended. I planned to play with a controller anyway as with games like these I usually lay back on the chair and leisurely play, yet in this case it was some of the worst experiences I've had with a controller recommended game. I could've beat the game at least 30 minutes faster if it wasn't for the atrocious controller + environment combination that caused me to repeat sections. There is a part where you have to jump from a wall to a hanging rope, swing and then jump to a bookshelf. I've spent 10 minutes repeating this area with the controller because 80% of the time the character refused to grab the rope, and at other times after swinging as strong as possible and pressing the jump key he'd just let go of the rope rather than jump from it. I gave up and used the keyboard, which worked instantly on the first try. This happened all throughout the game but in the other cases jumping so far wasn't necessary so letting go worked too. Following that, because the environment is 2.5D and you are not guided during parkouring this would often cause me to miss the object I was jumping too even though I was holding dead right or left. Or when everything there is are just stairs and your camera looks at them from the side but because I stir the slightest bit my character ends up falling off the stairs because he wasn't running in a straight line which you can't even see. Last big annoyance was at the end of the game where you need to carry an axe with you to hit an object. Throughout the entire game you always had to hold the pickup button to carry anything with you, and then here it holds it for you automatically at random times, then drops it by itself even though you were holding the key.\n\nTLDR;\nFantastic ambience, environment, enemies and story.

Overall, the best parts of the game were the graphics, atmosphere and music/sound design. It lends itself to a creepy feeling, tense experience. Those were my favorite parts of both games. \n\nOn the flip side, probably due to the nature of the way the game is played as a 'side scroller', but also 3d, it can be extremely frustrating at times to control the character how one desires. For example, making jumps across and not knowing the depth of the field in terms of how far forward or back the character is, can be confusing. Also, picking up certain objects can be very annoying as the hit box sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. I got to the point where I dreaded any section where I had to use mechanics to get through. The frustration with the controls/mechanics ruined the immersion for me several times unfortunately. \n\nAs far as the story went, I felt like it was OK, but certainly left a ton to the imagination. I wouldn't have minded if there was something more direct in terms of narrative.

I had to call on a more experienced gamer to complete one of the levels for me because I literally could not get past it, and he even had a hard time getting past it. Also, the ending is less satisfying than the first game, until you start researching theories. The plot twist was wildly unexpected and hard to piece together in general, but still great plot-wise. In all honesty, they made Little Nightmares 1 so perfect, which is probably where most of my critiques are stemming from- had this been the first version released, I may not have had such high expectations as I do from the first release.

They each bring a certain atmosphere, a variety of enemies and a main baddie. The weakest was would probably the last as it really becomes a bit too messed up for the sake of being messed up but still very enjoyable.\n\nReally liked the game, far more than the first one but it also earns some complaints. \nThe first would be the akward controls. This becomes somewhat frustrating during the combat and 'run the fuck away parts of the game', as it's either a perfect hit/button press or you can start all over again. It also doesn't help that the other NPC pushes you back or obstructs you while running.\nThe second would be the starting all over again, the animations are solid and top notch but they do take up some time if you die over and over to random button RNG. It's all very cinematic but gets a bit annoying.\n\nDid have one gamebreaking glitch in the hospital that forced me to restart the chapter, around 5-10 minutes setback. Another graphic glitch where some objects popped in as you left/entered a room.

While I still believe that humans are inferior beings, this game managed to impress me with its hauntingly beautiful visuals and eerie atmosphere.\n\nThe game follows the story of two human characters, Mono and Six, as they try to escape from their mysterious captors in a world that feels both surreal and dangerous. The game's plot is simple yet intriguing, with the story unfolding gradually as the game progresses.\n\nThe game's controls are easy to learn, making it accessible for all types of players. However, the game's real strength lies in its puzzles and the way they are integrated into the gameplay. The puzzles are challenging and require both careful observation and logical thinking to solve.\n\nThe game's enemies are also well-designed and provide a real challenge to players. They are not mere pushovers and require the player to be patient and strategic in their approach.\n\nOne of the game's strongest points is its sound design. The sound effects and music are expertly crafted to create an immersive and unsettling atmosphere that adds to the game's overall sense of unease.\n\nIn conclusion, Little Nightmares II is a game that surprised me with its well-crafted world, challenging gameplay, and excellent sound design. While it may not be a game that is suitable for all Decepticons, I can appreciate the effort put into creating a game that is both eerie and engaging. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good puzzle game with a haunting atmosphere.\n\n[spoiler]Playing Little Nightmares II is like facing off against Metroplex in battle - it's a challenge that requires skill and strategy to overcome![/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1680616782, "timestamp_updated": 1680616782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554848968982696533", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131573096": {"recommendationid": "131573096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851483646", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1674717664}, "language": "english", "review": "Little Nightmare is one of those franchise that make something scary and made it looks more interesting.

So you could say I was really excited about this sequel. And oh my did Little Nightmares return in the best way possible. It's a huge step up graphics-wise, and it delivers the perfect kind of terror the first game did with the new fearsome enemies and atmosphere. There's only one thing about this game I didn't like. And that is, this game is incredibly finicky. I played two run-throughs of this game. Both with keyboard and controller. And they both ended up with the same result, which is either: The character glitching around and responding too late to the controls, the AI breaking or not listening, or enemies grabbing you when they shouldn't have. And for some reason, there was something wrong with the swinging? I died at one part like ten times and fell into the abyss. Frustrating but funny at the same time. But besides the actual controlling part of the game, it's fantastic. I personally don't think it's better than the first since the first game is more memorable. But I really enjoyed and relished it.

Porque al fin reaparece nuestro personaje, Six (la protagonista del juego anterior), donde se encuentra cara a cara con nuestro protagonista actual, Mono, \u00a1y juntos van a tener que superar diversos obst\u00e1culos para poder seguir avanzando! Desarrollando as\u00ed un v\u00ednculo especial entre ellos dos durante el camino.\n\n Como en el juego anterior, no tienes poderes ni armas para luchar. Bueno, miento... Hay un gran arma de fuego para defenderte pero es ocasional. En s\u00ed s\u00f3lo cuentas temporalmente con un hacha, un martillo, una linterna y un control remoto donde los adquieres por separado en cada cap\u00edtulo para poder explorar, analizar y utilizar lo que tienes en tu entorno a tu favor. El sigilo sigue siendo primordial para poder avanzar en el juego pero ahora han agregado nuevas mec\u00e1nicas donde, por ejemplo, \u00a1puedes hacer emboscadas para contraatacar y as\u00ed superar niveles complejos!\n\n En cada escenario se puede sentir un clima MUY denso por su intensa tem\u00e1tica en particular, haciendo que vayas identificando lo que vas a enfrentar e inmediatamente experimentado una presi\u00f3n cont\u00ednua en cada paso que das, \u00a1junto con su infaltable banda sonora que te acompa\u00f1a en cada situaci\u00f3n cr\u00edtica! Tambi\u00e9n se puede apreciar c\u00f3mo hicieron mucho m\u00e1s complejos y detallados los niveles con respecto al juego anterior debido al gran contraste que surge cuando terminas un cap\u00edtulo y empiezas uno nuevo, \u00a1gracias a sus \u00fanicos escenarios ricos en detalles por cada lugar que mires!\n\n Personalmente debo admitir que, con esta entrega, \u00a1han superado al juego anterior! Tanto en el desarrollo de esta oscura historia (con un final a\u00fan m\u00e1s siniestro) como en los complejos pero intuitivos niveles, \u00a1y su GRAN banda sonora no tiene desperdicio alguno! Eso s\u00ed, lo \u00fanico que podr\u00eda llegar a criticar es que no hayan logrado plasmar bien en el jefe del cap\u00edtulo en el hospital su terror\u00edfica imagen que ten\u00eda originalmente en sus artes conceptuales (para m\u00ed estaba mucho mejor dise\u00f1ado en sus c\u00f3mics). Pero vuelvo a recalcar, \u00a1realmente vali\u00f3 cada segundo jugarlo!\n\n \u00a1Sinceramente es una verdadera joya este juego! Ojal\u00e1 que puedan continuar con la historia y nos muestren en una nueva entrega qu\u00e9 fueron de nuestros protagonistas, Six y Mono. Adem\u00e1s de que estar\u00eda interesante si volvieran a mencionar tambi\u00e9n a los otros personajes que fueron mostrados especialmente una vez en los c\u00f3mics, \u00a1si es que llegaron a sobrevivir!\n\n  Bueno, si llegas a adquirir este juego, \u00a1espero que lo puedas disfrutar tanto como lo disfrut\u00e9 yo al jugarlo!", "timestamp_created": 1669603887, "timestamp_updated": 1669603887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538167476654052734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126728441": {"recommendationid": "126728441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340172215", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1669425898}, "language": "english", "review": "Why is this rated so high?

their gender studies they are going to vomit into the story, Little Nightmares shines all the brighter. It's a marvel of a game, not a word of dialogue or exposition, set in such a uniquely envisioned, incredibly creepy and disturbing world, with such a strong sense of identity that you could show me a single frame from anywhere in the game and I could immediately tell you it's from Little Nightmares. I loved the first game, and in a twist that is rare in today's world, I loved the sequel even more. Not only is it quite a bit longer, the art design and visual storytelling was doubled down on, and it really bleeds through in every second. It's not a conventional horror game by any means, few jumpscares, no blood, no scenes put in for pure shock value, and still it manages to create such a creepy atmosphere, cut through by such intense encounters and horrific antagonists, that you will not forget this game for a long, long time. Sure there are frustrations, but these are mostly inevitable, as they stem from the sideways perspective, so you may often miscalculate a jump or the like, and it can get annoying sometimes. Nevertheless, I love this game, and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, cryptic, fairy tale-like experience.

recesses of your worst childhood nightmares. With its hauntingly beautiful visuals, clever puzzles, and a narrative that will leave you questioning reality, it's a game that embraces the darkness with a mischievous grin.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the shoes of Mono, a small, raincoat-clad protagonist, you're transported to a macabre world that feels simultaneously familiar and unsettling. The atmosphere is meticulously crafted, with every creaking floorboard and flickering light bulb serving as a reminder that you are not alone in this nightmarish realm.\n\nThe visual design of Little Nightmares II is a triumph in capturing the essence of childhood fears. From the grotesque and towering figures that haunt your every step to the decaying and dilapidated environments that exude a sense of foreboding, every frame feels like a carefully composed nightmare. The attention to detail in the art direction is simply masterful, creating an atmosphere that is both disturbing and awe-inspiring.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics in Little Nightmares II strike a perfect balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and stealth. Each area is a meticulously designed puzzle box filled with traps, hidden paths, and the ever-looming threat of your pursuers. The puzzles are cleverly crafted, requiring you to think outside the box and use your wits to progress. And let's not forget the heart-pounding moments of stealth as you tiptoe past grotesque creatures, praying they don't catch a glimpse of your trembling form.\n\nBut what truly sets Little Nightmares II apart is its ability to tap into your deepest fears and unease. The narrative unfolds in a way that leaves you questioning your own perception of reality, blurring the lines between dreams and nightmares. It's a game that lingers in your thoughts long after you've put down the controller, haunting your dreams and leaving you with a lingering sense of unease.\n\nThe sound design in Little Nightmares II deserves special praise. The atmospheric soundscapes, haunting melodies, and the cacophony of eerie noises come together to create an immersive audio experience. The subtle whispers, distant footsteps, and the unsettling groans of the nightmarish beings all contribute to the oppressive atmosphere, further immersing you in this twisted world.\n\nIn conclusion, Little Nightmares II is a clever and atmospheric journey into the depths of childhood nightmares. With its haunting visuals, ingenious puzzles, and a narrative that toys with your perception of reality, it's a game that will delight and disturb in equal measure. If you're a fan of dark and twisted experiences that challenge your senses and evoke a sense of dread, Little Nightmares II is an absolute must-play.

That said, this game blows the first one out of the water. Little Nightmares II has tighter (and honestly more forgiving) controls and more frequent save points than the first, which is the minimum you would hope for the difference is significant enough for me to care about it. Little Nightmares was all about telling a visual narrative, like many games in this genre and LN2 shares that same vigor for environmental storytelling, but this time on a much grander scale. The puzzles are fun, and sometimes funny, the \"enemies\" in this game are engaging and scary. The pacing of the puzzle-combat-escape sequence is perfect as I never feel like too much (or too little) time has passed in the progression. As well, the puzzles, as escape-room-esque as some may be, were not too challenging and also helped to enhance the atmospheric storytelling (as it can sometimes detract from). Lastly, the score and sound design for this game was sensational. The mixing was perfect, the diversity of score segments was awesome. My one complaint in it is that the sound loops were placed in a way where sometimes the score would cut out and in oddly, sort of like it glitched in changing to the new track.

It uses the very transparent device of taking things we consider innocent, namely, children and juxtaposing them with things that we find horrifying, vulgar or unsettling. But the magic lies in the execution - the wordless show-and-tell narrative, the sparse lighting, the bleak world, and heart-pounding pursuits by deranged adults - all serve to bring that device to life and craft a disturbing whole.\n\nThe gameplay consists of mild exploration, chase sequences, and puzzle solving. If you played the original, then Little nightmare II may not be as unsettling or as creepy. Firstly, the novelty factor is gone. Secondly, only one of the creepy adults, the teacher, was really actually disturbing in this game. The doctor might be a close second. The rest of the adults were not as scary as the janitor, chef, and the masked lady from the first game. The environments were also not as varied or as interesting as the first game's. The clunky movement and the strange control scheme from the first game are intact here.\n\n If you liked Inside or Limbo, you may enjoy this game if you can put up with the weird control scheme and the clunky movement and platforming.", "timestamp_created": 1673237761, "timestamp_updated": 1673237851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130467456": {"recommendationid": "130467456", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007476066", "num_games_owned": 2845, "num_reviews": 443, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1639633497}, "language": "english", "review": "Again you find yourself delving into the horrible adorable world of Little Nightmares.

Little Nightmares 2 has managed to do it on all possible fronts. This game is in a unique genre of it's own. I don't even know what to call it. It is such a unique concept. The people involved in its making have no fear thinking different and bringing villians with such unique and creative abilities that you wonder how their team meetings go and from where they get ideas for the kind of villians, both in LN1 and now in LN2. The fans of this series are moving from one room to the next, expecting the best and this studio not only delivers it but exceed their expectations every time. It's not easy to keep a gamer hooked when each room has a new puzzle that makes him think and nobody does it better than LN2. Apart from being visually stunning, the sorround sound of this game is damn amazing. Poor gamers like me were still able to run it at 1080p 60fps in a decade old GTX 1060. The stories end exactly different to how to expected it. The puzzles end exactly different from how you expected it. The characters and their skins and the way they interact with each and every element inside the whole enviornment is so good. They have improved upon little Nightmares 1 in every aspect and now am already waiting for the dlc. If you want a well polished game that runs smooth, is visually stunning, challenges your problem solving skills and keeps you hooked for atleast 8-10 hours, buy this game right away and support this amazing team who has done wonders to bring us a product like this in midst of a pandemic and all the gamers who made it on the other side and think their remaining life is a bonus, you won't regret giving a part of that bonus time to this masterpiece of a game. The little hushed \"aye\" and \"hey\" between six and mono and them holding hands and running together is the exact thing we needed.

I definitely recommend if you played and liked Little Nightmares 1. This time the horror elements are stronger, AI is much more responsive and challenges are generally more difficult. Puzzles are not impossibly hard but some of them makes you really think. I'm very satisfied that game was not \"completely platformer\" but only a decent amount. There are many memorable different locations and each has it's own story. Love it! \n\nHowever there are some things that will make you angry nonetheless:\n- Although an amazing addition, flashlight mechanic is really frustrating due to horrendous controls. You can never understand where how to target your flashlight correctly and the Hospital level is all about this mechanic. It literally took me 40% of all the time in the game to beat that level only.\n- There's a \"fight\" mechanic now and it's really fun. However, making this mechanic a must to beat levels made things complicated. It's hard to target your weapon to the target and if you miss 1 time you're most likely dead and you have to restart from the last checkpoint. I had some angry time in the school level where you have to beat multiple enemies but if you die in the end, you have to start beating them from the beginning. \n- Sometimes (rarely) very small stones and rubble on the ground stops your movement. Although they look totally innocent your character collide to them and guess what? You die. Because it happens mostly when you're running from someone! \n\nHave a good game!", "timestamp_created": 1679131888, "timestamp_updated": 1679131888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131443863": {"recommendationid": "131443863", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223044286", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 367, "last_played": 1694637853}, "language": "english", "review": "I want a third Little Nightmares game", "timestamp_created": 1674537800, "timestamp_updated": 1684878501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131191398": {"recommendationid": "131191398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261693454", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1674445077}, "language": "english", "review": "justice for my son mono", "timestamp_created": 1674199216, "timestamp_updated": 1674199216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130686968": {"recommendationid": "130686968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198977439154", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1673513081}, "language": "english", "review": "It's better and more horrifying than Little Nightmares 1, the graphic and gameplay are very fascinating!", "timestamp_created": 1673513457, "timestamp_updated": 1673513457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128666114": {"recommendationid": "128666114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056231832", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1671201798}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent sequel to a great game that raises the bar even higher in many aspects.

Lots of puzzles and creepy enemies.  The environment and visuals are very well-done and are probably the best parts of the game.\n\nThe plot is that this is a prequel to the first game.  Unfortunately, the story is so open-ended that I lost interest in it.  While things being \"up to the player\" isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's when that's the answer to every question players have that it just feels lazy.  Fans:  \"What about this theory?  Or this, mutually-exclusive alternate theory?\"  Developer Twitter:  \"Yes.\"  Come on, guys.  I shouldn't have to be a creative writing grad.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition appears to have had little to no playtesting, as I stumbled upon a very well-known game-breaking bug.  Playing the original Little Nightmares II is what made it work properly.  Hard to believe it hasn't been patched out by now.\n\nAdditionally, due to the fact that this is a 3D side-scrolling platformer, there's virtually no depth perception.  So, if you're trying to jump to a rope over a gap, get ready to fly right past it a few times and plummet to your death trial-and-error fashion.  Players' reaction time to chase events needs to be very precise, which can be frustrating if you don't already know what's going to happen.\n\nCons aside, your second playthrough should be a much better experience.  The achievement hunt won't take you very long either and some of the collectibles are pretty neat.\n\nBottom line, if you liked the first game, you will like this one.", "timestamp_created": 1665854908, "timestamp_updated": 1665854908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123564889": {"recommendationid": "123564889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198904398249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1666147635}, "language": "english", "review": "Ending made me curl up in a ball on my bed and question reality for a few hours. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1665280433, "timestamp_updated": 1665280433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123492085": {"recommendationid": "123492085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081212742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1664779782}, "language": "english", "review": "Thrilling and intriguing yet scary but amazing.

This one, however, takes it to a whole new level. Scarier monsters, creepier environments, and what I found to be a much better story, especially the conclusion. I loved everything about this one.\n\nThe puzzles are doable, not too difficult, but some things made me run around and try a few things before I figured it out. It also does a good job of giving you different items for different areas, which affect the puzzles in that section of the game. This keeps the puzzles and obstacles fresh as you play through the game. \n\nI played about half of this on my PC and half on my steam deck. It ran great on both with no problems. I tried to crank my steam deck output to 4K 60 fps while docked, that didn't turn out so good. But keeping it at 1080p 60 fps was smooth.\n\nThe story of this one kept me wanting to figure out more and once I entered the endgame I couldn't put the controller down. There's something to be said about a game having a fantastic story without having any characters that actually speak. The relationship and connection between the two main characters is spoken perfectly through their movements and the music. \n\nI can't recommend this one enough. If you were a fan of the first one, this is a must.

This is a game with a very interesting gameplay and a very engaging mind fucking blowing story. As a person who has played both first and second part of this series and has absolutely loved every second of them i gotta say that each part is unique and different and i personally cannot really compare these two or say which one is better because i love them on different levels. Tho i gotta admit the creators of this series really outdid themselves this time. The story of the second part is for sure more engaging than the first one it leaves you feeling some sort of way afterwards and it really fucks with your head till the very last second. Might i add the creators didn't left the creepiness in the first part. This is what makes this game very unique. At last but not least Little Nightmares 2 is a bigger and darker journey that is filled with beautiful looking scenes through out the whole game and mesmerizing soundtrack which in my opinion is one of the key elements of the game. It is full of gigantic and creepy monsters but in the end it shows you the scariest monster of them all is also the smallest creature in this game. 10/10 do recommend.

It sucks that this game is so laggy... I'm only at the hospital level (3rd) level and I had to quit the game so many times because I somehow end up stuck in glitches... Get stuck in a box, can't move after grabbing an item, get stuck behind a bed in the hospital level... Game crashed once after opening a drawer??? Had to restart the whole hospital level because the teddy bear containing the key never spawned... Tried reloading the checkpoint, quitting the game completely... Nothing to do...

For example, during the game you get a flashlight. There's a prompt that informs that you can turn it on and off, but what the game doesn't tell you is that you can shine the beam in a different direction as to where you're going, which is [b]absolutely essential[/b] in a later section.

They shouldn't be able to sell it when it's that broken. It's as simple as that.

Usually you know what the goal of the puzzle is (open door, get treasure, whatever), well, this game does away with all that. Good luck pixel hunting for Deus Ex Machinas!\n- you will die a lot because the game throws nonsense at you, you can't possibly understand until you've seen it, and then it usually still doesn't make a lot of sense\n- going through doorways is awkward and feels like you have to thread the eye of a needle\n- auto-grabs low ledges, but you have to hold a button for higher ledges (there must be some weird reason why auto-grab wouldn't work on higher ledges and ladders...)\n- BUGS:  Got stuck for a while because some script bug caused my buddy character to not help me, several more of these...\n\nAgain, a pity, because this could've been very good with a few bug fixes and control tweaks.\n\nEDIT: I played some more hours and arrived at the hospital section in the game. I can now safely say this is the most beautiful, but shittest game I've every played. The entire experience so far has been abysmal, frustrating and above all disrespectful towards the player.

Little Nightmares II shook me to the core, both as a visceral experience and a cerebral story it delivers an A-game in visual concept and auditive design. Little Nightmares truly embodies the feeling of a movie classic, on the fringes of mainstream but deeply rooted in the sentiment of excellency in the craft. What a story, what a design and what a perfect usage of the medium.\n\nGetting my initial gushing out of the way, Little Nightmares II (LN2) might at first glance come off as a rather cut-and-dried indie platformer but could as a complete piece just as well battle it out with the AAA titles in terms of intriguing yet easy-to-follow storyline, adventurous and thrilling gameplay paired with a distinct visual style. Problem with mainstream appeal when it comes to games is the re-playability aspect. As suspected this isn't a game you can grind, master or in any way quench your competitiveness, neither is it a mastodon practice in versatility and endless possibilities of role-playing. It is a concise game, with a wonderfully presented story and exquisite game mechanics to deliver said story.\n\nLN2 is very similar to the first installment, so if being stale is a worry when picking this game up I can assure you that it blows the first game out of the water with everything the developers have learned and keeps things fresh in terms of level design and cinematography while still not forgetting about the core concept. The only thing that could be argued is if the respective settings suit the style going for better, where the first game delivered the doll-house perspective to a tee through the setting of the fantastical yet intimate The Maw while the second game has \"outdoor\" acts where the \"cutting of the forefront\" doesn't benefit the immersion at points (for example, pools of water in a forest that are cut for the viewer in an aquarium sort of way). But I think this is more or less a matter of taste, as the whimsical [b]Spirited Away[/b] feel of the first game is countered with the bleak [b]Blade Runner[/b] or [b]Se7en[/b] reality of the second.\n\nIf it's something the Little Nightmares franchise succeed in it is its iconic imagery. Both in literal iconography and setting but of course most prevalent in its character designs which feeds into the gameplay. The long neck of the Teacher that follows your every step, the imminent danger of the Doctor that is ready to snatch you up or just the simple trick of playing into the most mundane features with the terror of a [i]Thin Man[/i]. Most impressive is the combination of characteristics that invoke horror but never disgust and gore such as: porcelain and bullies, mannequins and prostheses, apathy and disfigurement. Little Nightmares nails it all and does so with a beautiful way of setting the tone, creating a world and downright great graphics.\n\nThe puzzle platformer aspect of LN2 is killing it, both through innovation and immersion. It never truly challenges you, but more often than not tend to surprise you through it's practicality. This said, the only weak point of LN2 that can in my eyes be claimed is in fact the gameplay, though brilliant in it's simplicity it now and then falls victim to either frustrating trial and error or inconsistent design. The more evident of these being the addition of \"battle\" with a \"weapon\" that can be found lying around in a room for you to bash your enemies in the area with. This first comes down to maneuvering the said weapon and more importantly time your swings correctly which will take some deaths to figure out. But then the game present curve balls with some enemies (although identical in appearance) starting to juke your swings making the experience actually unfair on the initial encounter. This did not annoy me that much, but more so the fact that you keep on replaying certain parts because of your own incompetence, which is a shame as it ruins the flow of the game. The more egregious fallacy of the two is instead the matter of punishing level design and inconsistent windows for errors, as in several chase-esque sequences I managed to get caught even though I think I am on the right track. This made me reconsider the choices I've made which ultimately turns out futile as all I needed to do was make a jump at just the right time or make sure I don't bump into a single corner etc. At least two times I thus became stuck as I thought the game wanted me to look for another solution when in fact all I needed to do was perfectly execute said chase sequence.\n\nThe sound design and music is perfect, making use of themes from the previous game but buffing them to create an even bigger scope and urgency which really encapsulates the seriousness of the game compared to it's predecessor. The story is one for the ages and further develops the dark world Tarsier has created. The horror is more prevalent in this game than the first and it does have more disturbing imagery and settings, but never hits you with modern jump scare tropes. You always know why or when something is scary, it is just a matter of powering through and stay for the amazing game. I did have my share of chills, but I never felt betrayed or attacked as the developers have created a scary game that isn't an unbearable effort to play. One of the unironically best aspects of the game is the fact that you can hold hands. I never thought such a trivial thing would be so comforting yet immersive. Bravo.\n\nLN2 is a masterpiece, but a somewhat flawed one. With some tweaks here and there I would have hailed this game as the best one I've ever played, but as it stands now, some annoying nuisances stops it from reaching the upper echelons of the game medium. As an experience, it is on par with the best work of cinema, the most captivating of books and my most beloved pieces of music. That is Little Nightmares II.\n\n\n[b]9/10[/b]\n\n\n [hr][/hr] \n[b] [u] Links: [/u] [/b] \n\nI enjoy writing reviews.

Really missed horror games like these that put so much effort into the audio visual experience, it's almost like a Little Nightmares take on the Silent Hill setting but they totally go in their own direction with it and have their own story to tell.\n\nI've seen this game get flak for it's length and mechanics and I don't really agree with them. I think some of the people reviewing it like that IGN reviewer are misremembering how painfully short the original was. This game is probably about twice as long as the first, it just happens to have the same amount of chapters. Each one is more fleshed out with more variation in them.\n\nAbout the mechanics, I often do see people talk down about trial and error and clunky mechanics in horror games, but that's not really as much of a flaw as they say. I would argue that a horror game's environment should have dangers that keep you on your toes and punish you for not paying attention to where you're going. Some people will get frustrated with getting caught, walking into traps and dying but that sort of thing has been a hallmark of the horror genre since it's inception with games like Alone in the Dark. You're supposed to watch yourself because anything can happen. I died a lot in this game not gonna lie, but I never felt the trial and error got to be bull except maybe 1 or 2 times.\n\nI do hope they plan for at least one DLC because the pale city is such an interesting place and begs to be further explored more than The Maw did, in my opinion", "timestamp_created": 1613215417, "timestamp_updated": 1613215417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 191, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885609686374664307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99992277": {"recommendationid": "99992277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354905900", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1635082124}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n \u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611  Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls \n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2611 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2611 10", "timestamp_created": 1632663200, "timestamp_updated": 1634828728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 168, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881844997406005859", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86633756": {"recommendationid": "86633756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074956732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 466, "last_played": 1613249603}, "language": "english", "review": "Unforgettable game. 100% worth the money.\n\nLittle Nightmares 1 was already good but Little Nightmares 2 is:\n- better\n- longer\n- creepier\n- more disturbing\n\nThe game still impresses with its stunning art style and music.

Overall, this game is one of the best horror games I've actually played and would definitely recommend giving it a try, just probably play with a controller if you have one because M/KB can be a little funky.\n(Also you can hold hands with your friend which is literally the best thing ever and I hope future developers take notes)", "timestamp_created": 1613945545, "timestamp_updated": 1613945933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 114, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866854667663574219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115380859": {"recommendationid": "115380859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986120431", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1652378487}, "language": "english", "review": "I need Little Nightmares III, like how I need water.", "timestamp_created": 1652435015, "timestamp_updated": 1652435015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864678919315338135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86366869": {"recommendationid": "86366869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109582894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1619996309}, "language": "english", "review": "Having to wait for this game to be released was a Little Nightmare too.", "timestamp_created": 1613001406, "timestamp_updated": 1613001406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 243, "votes_funny": 242, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862679660320281982", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87646842": {"recommendationid": "87646842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038984568", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1614654006}, "language": "english", "review": "Always a delight when the second game is just as good or even better than the first. 10/10.

You're thrown into this unforgiving and creepy world. You experiment with stuff, interact with the world, and maybe even take some risks. And those approaches either work, or they don't and you die horrifically. This makes perfect sense from a meta-narrative perspective: you essentially play as a character who wants to know how the game world works and how to escape it. There are enemies, living and non-living, and they all want to cause you misery. It's up to you to escape that. Simple yet effective. It's not all perfect though; there are moments where the game becomes punishingly hard which [i]may[/i] feel bit unfair. Difficulty spikes aside, the game is generally quite easy as long as you keep in mind how the world works. There are plenty of checkpoints scattered throughout that even dying isn't really that much of a setback. Alongside the usual collectibles, each level also introduces new gameplay mechanics, used rather effectively.\n\nGraphics are fantastic. The forced 2.5D perspective gives the levels a foreboding sense of mystery that would probably be lost if this was a fully 3D platformer. Each level is densely packed with detail and you'd be surprised just how interactive some objects are, even the ones that you absolutely don't need to use. Many, many scenes are visually striking. I'd even use the word 'cinematic' to describe the best ones.\n\nSound design is exemplary. True to its name, the game has many creepy moments and the sounds just accentuate those perfectly. Directional audio is utilized exceptionally well, and it's often necessary to follow the sound cues so you can escape an encroaching danger safely.\n\nI don't want to spoil the story at all as it's best to discover it yourself. It has some genuinely disturbing moments that caught me off guard. Over the course of your journey, you may become quite attached to some characters and will feel anxious about their ultimate fate. Achieving that without a single line of spoken dialog is quite a feat. There are enough mysteries and secrets that I'm looking forward to the next game (one can hope we will get that!)\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is the occasionally frustrating controls. Because you don't move in a 100% 2D plane, it can sometimes be difficult to 'sense' where you're going to go. This problem can be mildly annoying in case of a failed jump to downright unfair in chase sequences where there is little room for error to begin with. I hope you see why that is a major roadblock in a purely trial and error game. Thankfully it gets better with a controller: analog sticks significantly improve the precision of movement. There's excellent controller rumble support, making you feel every jump, every heartbeat in particularly tense situations. While you [i]can[/i] play this with keyboard & mouse, I don't recommend that for the reasons mentioned. You'll just have a much more pleasant time if you fully stick to a controller.\n\nAs long as you can tolerate and familiarize yourself with the controls, LN2 can be quite a ride.\n\n[h1]My rating: 8.5/10.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1624846244, "timestamp_updated": 1627416150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837525904178619385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90530528": {"recommendationid": "90530528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202022263", "num_games_owned": 709, "num_reviews": 379, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1618689375}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Little Nightmares II [/h1]\n\n=== [ \ud83c\udfaf Difficulty: ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 No Difficulty\n\ud83d\udfe8 Easy\n\ud83d\udfe9 Standard\n\ud83d\udfe5 Big Learning Curve\n\ud83d\udfe5 Hard\n\ud83d\udfe5 Impossible\n\n=== [ \ud83d\udc6a Audience: ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 Everyone\n\ud83d\udfe5 Kids\n\ud83d\udfe9 Teens\n\ud83d\udfe9 Adults\n\ud83d\udfe9 Mature\n\n=== [ \ud83d\udc40 Graphics: ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 What Is This?\n\ud83d\udfe5 Bad\n\ud83d\udfe5 Acceptable\n\ud83d\udfe5 Good\n\ud83d\udfe9 Great\n\ud83d\udfe5 Stylistic\n\ud83d\udfe8 Beautiful\n\ud83d\udfe5 Masterpiece\n\n=== [ SOUND/MUSIC ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 Bad\n\ud83d\udfe5 Nothing Special\n\ud83d\udfe9 Good\n\ud83d\udfe5 Great\n\ud83d\udfe5 Beautiful\n\ud83d\udfe5 I\u00b4m Gonna Cry\n\n=== [ \ud83c\udf0f Story] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 This Game Has No Story\n\ud83d\udfe5 Nothing Special\n\ud83d\udfe5 It\u00b4s Alright\n\ud83d\udfe5 Well Written\n\ud83d\udfe9 Epic Story\n\ud83d\udfe5 Thinking About It, When I Sleep\n\n=== [ GRINDING ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe9 Nothing To Grind\n\ud83d\udfe5 Isn't Necessary To Progress\n\ud83d\udfe5 Average Grind Level\n\ud83d\udfe5 A Lot Of Grinding\n\ud83d\udfe5 You\u2018ll Need A Second Life For Grinding\n\n=== [ \ud83d\udc8e Price ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 Free\n\ud83d\udfe5 Underpriced\n\ud83d\udfe8 Perfect Price\n\ud83d\udfe9 Could Be Cheaper\n\ud83d\udfe5 Overpriced\n\n=== [ \u2623 Requirments: ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 A Toaster Could Run This\n\ud83d\udfe9 Low\n\ud83d\udfe5 Average\n\ud83d\udfe5 Above Average\n\ud83d\udfe5 High End\n\ud83d\udfe5 NASA Computer\n\n=== [ \u23f0 Game time/length ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 Really short ( 0 - 4 hours)\n\ud83d\udfe9 Short ( 4 - 12 hours)\n\ud83d\udfe5 Average ( 12 - 24 hours)\n\ud83d\udfe5 Long ( 24+ hours)\n\ud83d\udfe5 Multiplayer/Neverending\n\n=== [ \ud83d\udc1e Bugs ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 Game itself is a bug\n\ud83d\udfe5 Lot of bugs\n\ud83d\udfe5 Few Bugs\n\ud83d\udfe9 Nothing\n\n=== [ ENJOYMENT ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 I\u00b4d Rather Watch Grass Grow\n\ud83d\udfe5 Hard To Enjoy\n\ud83d\udfe5 Repetitive\n\ud83d\udfe5 It's Okay\n\ud83d\udfe9 Fun To Be Had For Sure\n\ud83d\udfe5 The Kind Of Fun You Will Remember\n\ud83d\udfe5 Life Changing\n\n=== [ REPLAYABILITY] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 One-Time Experience\n\ud83d\udfe9 Only For Achievements\n\ud83d\udfe9 If You Wait A Few Months/Years\n\ud83d\udfe5 Definitely\n\ud83d\udfe5 Infinitely Replayable/Multiplayer\n\n=== [ WORTH PLAYING ] ===\n\ud83d\udfe5 No\n\ud83d\udfe5 Wait For A Sale\n\ud83d\udfe9 Yes\n\ud83d\udfe8 I Can\u00b4t Recommend It Enough\n\nTOP 3 FUN THINGS TO DO:\n\u2b50\ufe0fHolding Six's hand.\n\u2b50\ufe0fSolving puzzles.\n\u2b50\ufe0fTravelling through TV's.\n\nTHE UNIQUES:\n\ud83d\udc8eSpecial kind of AI.\n\ud83d\udc8eSpooky atmosphere.\n\nPLAYER GAMING REQUIREMENTS:\n\ud83d\udcbcDark.\n\ud83d\udcbcPuzzle.\n\ud83d\udcbcAdventure.\n\nVERDICT:\nYou get the exact same vibe as LN1 but this one is based before the first title, showing you what Six was like before hand and how she got onto the ship which I really appreciated.

Either way, the story is dark and the ending is not what anyone would expect.\n\nI only see one error with this game and that's the game length, I took my time with this game and I still managed to finish this under 6 hours, it's far too short for their steep asking price.\nTotal Score = 91/100.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nLittle Nightmares I, Limbo, It Takes Two.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIt is the prequel to 2017's Little Nightmares, and features a new player character, a little boy named Mono, with the protagonist from the previous game, Six, appearing as a computer-controlled character.

It features more invigorating chases, better graphics, a thicker atmosphere... and some of the old problems, too. The collisions are just as bad, seeing how I got stuck in geometry several times. The controls are still floppy, and with how the sequel keeps handling depth perception, every wooden plank over a bottomless abyss was a bridge too far. I've also encountered a few bugs like screen transitions not working or when the remote refused to turn off the TV in the living room puzzle. If any of this happens to you, don't sweat it. Exit to the main menu and reload a save.\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nNow that we're done with the flaws, look at it! One could have an eyegasm just by observing the stills, but wait till you see things in motion. Whoever designed and animated the game's twitching, twisted monstrosities deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as H.R. Giger and Masahiro Ito. Somewhat realistic and simultaneously stylized environments, bathed in theatrical lighting, arouse curiosity, making you ponder what macabre stories transpired behind the scenes. The overwhelming decadence is portrayed so gorgeously that it may seem like the game romanticizes the collapse. However, it's quick to remind us we're not wading through a whimsical cartoon but a fairy tale of sunless purgatories, forever haunted by a cannibal's lullaby.\n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\n[quote]All we had to do, was follow the damn train, CJ![/quote]\nThe gameplay is involving and challenging, but let's face it, you're mostly dragged around on a leash. The debilitating leash lends itself perfectly, considering that Little Nightmares is a rapid, linear horror experience with the accents shifted from the player's agency to tight set pieces, immersion, and themes. Here, being weak and bound is the whole point. Even that clunky combat, despite its skull-crushing viciousness, is anything but empowering and only amplifies the feeling of impotence. You are everyone's prey and the distorted world itself is your lurking big bad wolf.\n\nI couldn't always foretell when something life-threatening would start, so I never felt completely safe, which is great. The gameplay is almost seamlessly divided into separate sections and comes to solving mostly platforming puzzles at your own leisure, then doing the same with some angry ass abomination on your tail. These thrilling sequences are delivered in short bursts, thank god. Otherwise, my heart would pop from the sense of urgency, the sheer level of engagement, and faulty depth perception that lead to more deaths than I could count.\n\nStealth is fast-paced and doesn't try your patience or detract from the action for too long. Instead, the difficulty gets manifested in testing your ability to guess the intended route and stick close to it as the only means of survival. Underestimate another indeterminate hitbox, miss a tiny window of opportunity, or let your thumb slip off the stick for a millisecond - and it's over. By design, it's a trial and error sprint, which I have nothing against, considering the generous autosave frequency. You'll never lose more than a few minutes of progress.\n\nI enjoyed the moments of anticipation, stimulating payoffs, as well as the truly nightmarish imagery that got under my skin. I sort of pride myself on being desensitized to everything disturbing, so I began as a skeptic, all up-in-arms with that cheeky \"try me\" attitude. Before the classroom scene struck me down. The game got me good there, making me irrevocably fall under its dark spell thereon. And then, these mannequins... Condemned has nothing on this. There's so much pleasure in seeing an old trope done right. It was a fun ride.\n\n[h3]Themes[/h3]\n[quote]Best days of our short, terrible lives.[/quote]\nI deliberately steer away from the word \"story\" since I'm still not sure if it exists outside of Internet's conspiracy theories. These guys casually make FNAF look as if it had the same level of thought put into it as Mulholland Drive, so they can take a hike. I have nothing against intentionally muddying the waters though, accepting the narrative as an abstraction. All I know is that Little Nightmares 2 is a prequel where instead of obese elites, this time, we have the office middle class and blue collars. Less feasts and cruises, more nooses and the omnipresent TV.\n\nThe setting appeals to everything emotional rather than rational. I can feel what they mean by all the casual cruelty, bent reality, Oliver Twist vs. Pinocchios dichotomy, the unsettling prosthetics. The decay, the futility, the brutality of hushing and smothering. I could hear Pink Floyd playing in my head, too. Deep down in my heart, I understand, but I can't begin to interpret the cardinal vibe of this game's surreal ensemble literally. Is it about willpower, twisting the hand of morbidly grimacing fate? Is this how adults get made?

This game has a LOT of moments where things are going great and then you die to something you could not have known about, and then you die there a bunch until you figure out how to get past it. It really ruins the pace and mood, especially since each death kind of lessens the tension when you realize you're just going to be at a nearby checkpoint.

It's visuals are gorgeous, it's puzzles clever and it's horror and atmosphere absolutely dripping of dread.\n\nIt does practically everything right that a sequel should, upping the mystery of the world, exploring the characters that inhabit it, and definitely ramping up the scares. It's without a doubt one of my absolute favourite horror games, and a lot of it is due to the fact that it never relies on cheap jump-scares but rather builds such an oppressive audio-visual atmosphere that you can't help to hesitate when stepping into a new, often darkened and gloomy, room. The Little Nightmares series captures such a feeling of dread that I haven't really felt since playing Silent Hill 2 for the first time, and I'm not even exaggerating.\n\nThe story had me hooked from the very first moment, and I just found myself more and more invested the deeper I went, very similar to the first outing. Having played the original isn't necessary, but it's a great benefit as it fills in a lot of story details and character motives.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the visuals leave very little to be desired. It has this sense of scale and depth that truly takes your breath away. You feel so small and exposed throughout your journey, and there are plenty of vistas where you can't help but to stop and just stare, taking in the landscapes and horrors spread before you.\n\nA huge part of the presentation is also the audio design and music, and I can't stress enough the benefit of playing this with a good sound setup. Every booming footstep on a floor above you, the creak of a rotting floorboard, and the rasping breaths of the denisens of the dreary places you venture through are superb. Tobias Lilja wrote and produced the soundtrack, and he did an absolutely stupendous job with it, filled with chilling ambience and pounding, oppressive, industrial beats, another part of the games design that reminds me of the best parts of the Silent Hill franchise.\n\nThe puzzle sections are often challenging but never unfair, with plenty of clues both in the environment, and cleverly visualized by your AI partner that accompanies you throughout most of your journey. The hints never feel too on-the-nose and leave most of the brain gymnastics up to the player.\n\nMy only complaint is that some of the more panic-filled parts, where you need to perhaps outrun a foe, can often feel like trial and error, where the things you are trying to escape from behaves unpredictably, sometimes catching you in an unfair situation where only dying and trying again will get you through. You'll get killed by one move, try again and get past it, just to get killed by a second move moments later. Repeat until you beat the scenario. However, these are very few, there are only 2 or 3 sections that made me feel this way, and the rest is thrilling and heart-pounding from beginning to end.\n\nOverall, I absolutely adore this franchise, and I hope we get to see more of this world in the near future. I'd love some DLC that expands the universe in a similar way as the DLC for the first game did, but it also feels like there's plenty of room, both in the story and in the universe as a whole, for a sequel to continue the web of intrigue that Tarsier Studios have woven.", "timestamp_created": 1613332350, "timestamp_updated": 1613332794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826101183891296387", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108744690": {"recommendationid": "108744690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004496223", "num_games_owned": 987, "num_reviews": 210, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1643094292}, "language": "english", "review": "Little Nightmares 2 (LN2) is an impeccable addition to the horror genre. Every feature is noteworthy, from stunningly macabre visuals to its suspense adventure gameplay. It manages to craft an incredibly immersive universe without relying on any dialogue. LN2 is truly a standout horror experience and I hope to see the talented developers of Tarsier Studios come back with LN3.\n\n[b] [u]Pros[/u] [/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Extremely immersive and rich game universe\n    [*] Stunning macabre art style\n    [*] Mixture of puzzles, action & suspense.\n    [*] Replay value to retrieve collectables/achievements.\n[/list]\n[b] [u]Cons[/u] [/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Easy to become stuck in/on objects.\n    [*] Clunky controls can be difficult to pick up items.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nLN2's narrative is somewhat up for debate, given that is told completely through its gameplay and visuals, without any hint of dialogue, so I will only comment on my interpretation of it. I have kept this section purposefully vague to avoid any spoilers.\n\nPlaying as a young boy named Mono, he finds himself in an eerie, morbid world that is filled with many different threats. After traversing the dangers alone, he soon finds another lost soul, a young child named Six. After a cautious introduction to each other, they become united and aid one other on their treacherous journey. Without any time to reflect on the horrors they've witnessed, they continue forwards, hand in hand and a strong trusting bond is formed. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2729166932\n\nI loved the way the Little Nightmares franchise conveys their stories. Nothing is spoon fed to the player, almost everything is up for interpretation, to discover the hidden (or not-so-hidden) meanings behind the game\u2019s happenings. Yet, it is not told in a confusing or obscure manner. I found that it also assisted in conveying the loneliness and somber tone which the developers have seemingly mastered.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nLN2 features a mix of gameplay, often grouped in different sections, whilst seamlessly switching between each other. Most dominantly, it is a suspense adventure game with platforming, puzzle and stealth elements. Yet, there are various intense (and at times, unforgiving) chase sequences and even action/\"fighting\" parts. I term the phrase \"fighting\" lightly as it is by no means the heart of the game, but adds diversity. \n\n[b] [u]Horror Elements[/u] [/b]\nWhilst there are ample titles plastered all over Steam that are labelled \"horror\", I am certain many  thriller enthusiasts will agree with me when I say that most of the cheap Indies are just not scary. Understandably, this will differ from person to person, and we all have differing ideas of what is \"thrilling\" or \"scary\u201d, but this is where LN2 succeeds. LN2 is a standout title because it understands where most of horror titles go wrong. Atmosphere and tension building. It does not rely on cheap scares or an overabundance of enemies to cause a shock response from the player.  Instead, it builds its immersive universe right from the very beginning and adds to it as the game progresses. LN2's threats are ever evolving, it is never known if you are in a safe area, or not. Events can go from 0-100 extremely quickly and when it is least expected. Chase sequences do not drag on endlessly, they are short and abrupt, keeping players on edge for the entirety of the game. The threats themselves are extremely unnerving, both in their appearance, the way they move and the accompanied excellent sound design. My favourite area was exploring the grungy hospital, but beware of its patients, they will come after you in the darkness, when you're not directly looking at them and when you least expect it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2731016444\n\n[b] [u]Puzzles[/u] [/b]\nLN2 is a linear experience, and I never found its puzzles difficult at all. Majority of the puzzles are platform based. Some examples include pushing something to be able to reach the next area (as the protagonist is very small), find items and display them in the correct order (shown on a nearby template), locate a key by using an X-ray machine to check the innards of nearby toys or traverse portals by following sound. These are just a handful of examples and there are plenty more, but what I appreciated most is that players are never told explicitly what to do, but there is no need for that. The game design was set out remarkably, so this was simply not required. However, if I continuously died in a certain section, or took far longer than intended, sometimes a vague hint would show up such as \"Use L toggle to push items\".\n\n[b] [u]Action & Save Points[/u] [/b]\nThere are moments in the game where, unlike many suspenseful horrors, players can and must fight back to survive. Mono can pick up a nearby hammer and slam it down on attacking enemies. However, it must be well timed as generally there is only 1 chance to succeed, if that is missed then it is usually game over. This is not all bad as the game has an extensive auto save system which saves very frequently.\n\n[h1]Visuals & Sound[/h1]\nThe art in Little Nightmares is gorgeous, in the most morbid way possible. It brilliantly combines a very tiny and innocent little boy into a hideous and devoid world, filled with everything trying to hunt him down. As the protagonist is so small, everything around him looks out of proportion and extremely daunting, even if it is just simple things like a door (which he cannot reach). It is a great metaphor for how he dangerous the world seems around him.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2730284026\n\nAs stated previously, there is no dialogue. Yet, the masterful sound design tells its story and is sure to keep players on edge. Often, I heard the enemies before I saw them, and it was enough to make me nervous before I had even entered the room where the anticipated threat was.\n\n\n[h1]Technical & Stats [/h1]\n[quote][b]This game was played using a controller and with the following PC specs.:[/b]\nIntel i5-9400 2.9 GHz\n16GB RAM\nGeForce RTX 2060 6GB\n2560x1440 resolution\nHDD\nWindows 10[/quote]\n\n[b]Playtime:[/b] Took approx. 6.5 hrs whilst taking my time.\n[b] Controller Recommended? [/b] Yes\n[b]Replayability value:[/b] Yes, many collectable items to find including hats and glitched fragments.\n\n\n[h1]Bugs & Glitches[/h1]\nUnfortunately, I did find myself colliding with objects on a handful of occasions. Especially when trying to sneak by undetected. I often became stuck in objects and could not move, usually resulting in the enemy spotting me. It was also more difficult than it should have been when trying to pick up objects or grasp ledges quickly. Perhaps just a result of slightly clunky controls but it did become frustrating.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nLittle Nightmares 2 is a must play for horror enthusiasts. Its suspense riddled gameplay, cute yet grim visuals and ever-changing game formula make it one of the best horror experiences I have had in a long time. Even describing it is difficult, as it is exceptionally unique and distinctive.  If you like spooky adventure titles with some light puzzles, do yourself a favour and pick this one up. \n\n Disclaimer: Thank you very much to my kind friend for gifting me this game\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34936724][quote]Follow my curator page, [b]Cookie Reviews[/b], if you enjoyed this review and want to see more like it.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1643102163, "timestamp_updated": 1643102463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826078057289123535", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87290157": {"recommendationid": "87290157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172928046", "num_games_owned": 1395, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1614094922}, "language": "english", "review": "Better love story than Twilight.", "timestamp_created": 1614086735, "timestamp_updated": 1614086735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 193, "votes_funny": 108, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825136840343475342", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114108134": {"recommendationid": "114108134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129903094", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 502, "last_played": 1695300245}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than league of legend", "timestamp_created": 1650343236, "timestamp_updated": 1650343236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822218835353851318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117679864": {"recommendationid": "117679864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202015136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3354, "last_played": 1659402192}, "language": "english", "review": "My absolute favourite game series, it doesn't rely on jumpscares to frighten people, just the atmosphere and tense moments are enough.

Story\n'Mono' wakes up in a forest and runs away from the monsters with a girl named 'Six' he met there.\n\n\n2. Play Time\nMain: 5~6h\n100% complete: 7-8h\n\n\n3. Graphic & Sound\nOverall, slight growth was made in various areas such as texture processing, drawing lines, and lighting, giving the impression of being visually neat.\n\nIn addition, since the Enhanced Edition is provided for free, you can enjoy the game with better graphics if your computer has sufficient specifications.\n\nSound is just an assistant stuff that help the game to maintain a gloomy atmosphere and tension. It has a repetitive form and uncomfortable and bizarre tones, but the sound itself does not overwhelm the player.\n\n\n4. Creatures and puzzles\nIn 'Little Nightmares 1', the creature has an appearance reminiscent of the old Halloween costume or 'The spirited away'. However, there was a sense that it was not enough to be called a horror game because the proportion of puzzles was too high rather than these creepy creatures.\n\nEven this approach had been used previously in 'Limbo' and 'Inside', with puzzles of inferior quality and completion, so 'Little Nightmares 1' remained in my memory as a disappointing work in many ways.\n\nHowever, in 'Little Nightmares 2', a homage to monsters that appear in ghost stories and other horror creations raises the charm of the creature to the next level. Slender Man, The Ring, nurse of Silent Hill.\n\nActually various creatures also appeared in 'Little Nightmares 1', but they were more often simply decorated in the background. However, in this 'Little Nightmares 2', it takes the form of reacting with the player in real time, amplifying the fear and charm that only creatures can give.\n\nAlso they pursued both novelty and fun by using well-structured puzzles and puzzles that cooperate with NPC instead of monotonous and repetitive puzzles.\n\n5. Story Supplement\nPlayers who have played 'Little Nightmares 1' may have found it difficult to understand the story due to its sudden development and poor narrative. In addition, since the DLC developed a side story, it could not fill the lack of explanation of the main story.\n\nBesides, The lack of a story aggravated confusion because this game was not meant to satire and criticize with philosophical content like Limbo or Inside. To compensate for this, a narrative was added through comics, but there are not many people who search for comics to explore the worldview.\n\nIn 'Little Nightmares 2' ,the prequel, dealt with and the past of 'Six' and expanded worldview. There is still a lack of explanation about the origin of monsters and background of the worldview, but I can understand the ending of 'Little Nightmares 1' at least. And I'm looking forward to the next part as it hints that the worldview will be dealt with in earnest in 3.\n\n\n6. Shortcoming\n6-1) price of deluxe\nI think the price of the main story is reasonable considering the discount range, but the price of the deluxe product isn't quite understandable. The stuffs of the deluxe edition is to bundle an artbook, a useless hat, and soundtrack. I think it is a mockery of existing users to separate and commercialize the art book and hat, which were the existing rewards for Collectible.\n\nSome may say that it is expensive because it is a 'deluxe', but not everyone is an oil king who can casually spend this price.\n\n\n6-2) Incomplete optimization\nToo many small bugs. I couldn't proceed because of a bug, so I clicked 'Restart from checkpoint' a lot.\n\nIn addition, there is a problem in that the 'movement hitting the wall' and the 'motion interacting with the object' collide, so that the proper operation is not performed. More precisely, the linkage between motions is unnatural. This causes unintended inconvenience in many action scenes.\n\n\n6-3) Checkpoint problem\nIn order to get Collectible, you may have to endure the inconvenience of having to complete all chapters. If you're very unlucky, you may have to replay the entire game. Comparing this with Limbo and Inside's checkpoint system, I can tell that it is a really poor system.\n\nHowever, auto save except the collectible is really well-set-up.\n\n\n6-4) Safe location\nAnother problem is that the enemy's detection system works strangely unless you are located in a 'specific location' in a chase or hide-and-seek scene. Even if you hide properly in visual, enemy can see through wall and find you because you are located in wrong position which is 1mm away from safe location.\n\n\n6-5) Difficulty\nI'm not criticizing the difficulty became harder. However, in some sections, it was set not to tolerate even single mistake, so it was a level that felt unreasonable rather than difficult.\n\nRepeated trial and error causes frustration rather than fear, and it prevents immersion in the game, so I think it is necessary to relax the baseline for achieving the goal a little.\n\n\n7. Conclusion\nUnlike the previous work, this work has enough play time and provides a variety of play experiences for each chapter. However, it is true that the price is burdensome to purchase without a discount.\n\nTherefore, considering the discount, if you purchase the 'regular version' not the 'deluxe version', I think you will be more satisfied with the price.", "timestamp_created": 1663104030, "timestamp_updated": 1678203585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751112282276153564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100578554": {"recommendationid": "100578554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989559732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 793, "last_played": 1628521372}, "language": "english", "review": "Little Nightmares 2 is exactly what you'd expect, the perfect game to follow up on the success of its predecessor... but I don't really know if that was enough for me.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, LN2 is a great game definitely worth playing and I absolutely recommend it for anyone thinking of giving it a go, but in all honesty there's really nothing that sets it apart from the original Little Nightmare; the game looks, sounds and feels exactly like the first game... you have the same great art style that creeps into your nightmares when the lights go out, that same immersive OST that will run chills down your spine at the turn of every corner, the same rich story that will leave you questioning your own reality when you reach the end of the road, hell, it even has the same choppy controls on keyboard and mouse with the bad camera angles that will ultimately be the death of you more than any resident of the Pale City. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that LN2 feel more like a DLC for the original title than it does a whole separate game.

It is [b]not[/b] necessary to play the first [url=store.steampowered.com/app/424840/Little_Nightmares/] \"Little Nightmares\" [/url]. But I do recommend playing the games in sequential order.\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]First upfront HAVE A GOOD PAIR OF HEADPHONES![/h1]\n Every bit of sound is SSR+(GOD for those that aren't weebs) TIER. I cannot stress this enough, having a decent quality will enhance your gameplay experience. I feel that the devs took a HUGE chunk of time designing every aspect of sound in the game; from taking a hammer and dragging it from uneven floor planks to the sound of raindrops hitting your character's head.\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\n  So overall I enjoyed how the story was delivered. Having a \"new\" partner & learning when your partner and yourself fit into this story arch. It keeps you guessing as you learn more about this world that you're dropped into, But as far as the overall progression as a whole franchise. I'm kinda salty... [spoiler] [b]**Read at the risk of spoiling the story[/b] I was wanting to know more about this world. Where Six was going after she absorbed the Geisha from the first one? Or Like where is everyone in the world? How did Mono end up where we started at? But to keep this rant short, I just ended up having more questions than answers. Which has me excited to see where the next game in the series will take us. I just [b]REALLY[/b] wanted some answers.[/spoiler] I was wanting some answers and I feel that I never got them. \n The game had an alright level of horror to it. I probably would feel comfortable having a young/early teen play it. If you're coming into the game to have a high level of scares, this isn't your game. This game is first I feel an adventure game with horror/mystery elements in it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay/Mechanics[/h1]\n A positive experience in both gameplay/game mechanics. Not much has changed from the first one. They did add a \"buddy\" to help you overcome some obstacles, but overall the difficulty of the \"puzzles\" wasn't too hard. It was the right amount I feel. You'll get a few deaths trying to solve a boss fight/area, but then you'll see the error of your ways. You'll correct and continue on your journey. The mechanics are still engaging enough, you can't mindlessly point and click your way through it. I was concerned slightly that the mechanics/puzzles would be repetitive from the first one. But with the introduction of a buddy and the way that the devs pull you in with the atmosphere and the story, they were just fine. In short, if you didn't have a problem with the first game's mechanics, or if you don't mind a sidescrolling 3d world for which you interact; You're gonna have a great time.\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]Final thoughts?[/h1]\n  Not much to say. I had a great time playing/streaming the game. I'm ABSOLUTELY in love with the music and how just sucks you into the game. I'm excited to see where the devs/studio take the next installment (assuming that there is one.
