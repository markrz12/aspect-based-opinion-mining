I decided to replace his ears with bionic ones, but I didn\u2019t notice that he was a Body Purist who hated artificial body parts.\n\nWhile he was lying on the operating table and recovering from the surgery, a huge raid happened. The raiders built siege weapons and attacked us with rockets and mortars. I managed to fight them off, but one of my colonists died. It was the doctor\u2019s spouse.\n\nThe doctor woke up with pain, grief, and anger. He dug up his spouse\u2019s corpse and brought it to the main hall, where he laid it on a table. This made everyone else unhappy and stressed.\n\nOne of my colonists was a cannibal, and he was hungry and wounded from the raid. He saw the corpse on the table and decided to eat it. This triggered a mental breakdown in the doctor, who attacked the cannibal. They started a brawl that soon involved other colonists.\n\nOne of my colonists was a pyromaniac, and he was also stressed and angry. He grabbed a flamethrower and started to set everything on fire. The fire spread quickly and engulfed most of the base.\n\nThe doctor had an infection from the surgery, and he was bleeding and feverish. He was also the best doctor in the colony, so no one else could treat him properly. He died on the floor, surrounded by flames and blood.\n\nBy the time a mysterious stranger in a cloak came to help us (when everyone was downed and helpless), it was too late. Most of the base was burned down, and most of the colonists were dead or dying. The only survivor was the drug addict, who had taken all the drugs in the colony and wandered off to a meadow.

See... nobody was allowed in the kitchen except Umami and Cookie, they had things under wraps but Bacon, Pigskin Rancher by trade, joined right as our colony was descended upon by 47 man eating Persian Cats and we must have forgotten to tell him the rules. He snuck in one morning with the well-meaning intention of making the other colonists breakfast as a thanks for saving his life. It was a sweet gesture, nobody though anything of it, until it came to light that Bacon, despite their name, had no idea how to cook.\n\nWhat appeared to be some innocent, and well intentioned pancakes began the downwards spiral to our demise. Stricken with debilitating food poisoning we were caught out of position by an invasion, bugs swarming, teeming up from under our feet, right in the middle of our cursed dining room. Before we could react they'd bored through three sets of walls to our nursery... the kids didn't stand a chance. Only 2 year old Melons survived and only just barely. \n\nWe thought that was the extent of our misfortunes, but delirious with food poisoning still, exhausted, and wracked with grief one of the despondent mothers snapped, attempting to take a knife to Melons neck. Umami, a frail old man, attempted to intervene but her rage was his end, and it was his head she claimed in the end. Umami, a friend of everybody, had been a pillar of the colony since day one, he'd fallen from the stars and survived the other founders, he'd been a face everybody had known, everybody turned to, the gentle, elderly leader of our colony since anybody could remember. And now he was dead.\n\nYou could say that hope died with Umami. With the kindly old elder slain, with our future generation culled before they even understood the world, and with one of the sacred matrons rotting in prison it was a slow, heart rending spiral. The wise left, the determined stayed to be bent and broken attempting to carry the colony, and so when the raiders from the north arrived you could argue that we were already dead. Our individual hearts were pumping blood through our individual bodies, but the heart of the colony had stopped long before.\n\nWelcome to the Rim.

The concepts are all simple enough to learn and there is a neat built-in tutorial. Once the few interface paradigms are mastered then you're most of the way there.

You may as well get caught by surprise by the random events, forcing you to adapt and overcome the challenge like a badass, or just watch your pawns die in a horrific way.

Then, a week or two prior to me writing this, DF actually released.\n\nLeaving aside for a moment that DF's new UI is less polished than RW's (and that's not minor - in a colony management sim, the interface is most of the game), playing DF again gave me an appreciation of a concept I had not fully grasped: While it is undeniably true that DF is more complex than RW, just because something is complex, doesn't mean it's more [i]interesting.[/i] I always balked at the fact that you have only a tiny handful of pawns in RW, but what I didn't realize is that when you have dozens of dwarves, their complexity becomes white noise. In any game like this, the more colonists you have, the harder it is to make meaningful decisions about them as individuals.\n\nI dropped DF almost immediately, and continued playing RW.

You decide to play \"a bit\" since [insert your favourite Live Service game here] has a planned downtime etc. and next thing you know is the sun dawning and your alarm going off. I didn't even notice I had almost 1.8k hours until someone else mentioned \"having spent way too much time in this game\" at 300 hours and I became curious as to where I stood on that matter.\n\nThe developers not only produce quality expansions that even come with platform updates that enhance your gameplay even if you decided not to purchase the DLC, some of them are even actively engaged in the frankly ridiculously massive modding-community and vice-versa (I'm looking at you, Vanilla Expander Oskar Potocki).\n\nIf you think \"Hmm, this would be a nice addition to the game\" about literally anything, someone probably already put a mod on the workshop doing exactly that, and even in the case of a game update breaking some aspects about the mod, another modder mightve already forked the outdated mod and brought it up to the new game patch.\n\nWith how infinitely replayable Rimworld is and no two playthroughs being the same I'm 100% certain I'll spend my hourcount once over again and way more and not regret a single second of it (although more and more of that will be spent loading up the client since \"The modlist must grow\" is entirely too real of a concept).\nLudeon Studios rarely put the game on any discount if at all, but at whatever price it's at, its very good value for how much content you'll get out of it at the end.\n\nAll in all, great game, 5/7, would harvest organs of rebellious prisoners again, anti-grain mortar shells dont pay for themselves.\n\nEdit: No Edits, just me renewing this review so I can grab the Lv4 Steam awards badge by nominating

This has sucked the quality and uniqueness of games completely out of the market, reducing my entertainment value to what I could extract from other people in PVP style games. \n\nBut then there was Rimworld. I knew little of it and had begun watching all the old content of youtubers like the spiffing brit and that other guy who went viral who does series and narration, hes quite soothing but I am bad with names and my focus remains this review. Through recommendation, the gods of youtube brought me to a dedicated rimworld youtuber, a british man who enjoyed worshiping both Cuthulu and catgirls. \n\nSo I bought the game with what cash i could scrounge up and within 3 weeks, I had 100+ hours of playtime. \nThe level of detail in this game has blown the proverbial load of expectation all over the concubine of reality.

I will not review that here. \n\nIf you are of the belief that video games are fundamentally a story-telling medium, perhaps one of the best, you should get this game. \n\nIf you are the kind of digital masochist that enjoys FromSoft titles and other works that hurt you because they love you, you should get this game. \n\nIf you unironically enjoyed the Sims but thought it could be made miles better with an in-depth survival system and an adjustable AI god throwing rocks at your head to keep things spicy, you should get this game.\n\nIf you think linear storylines are for squares and the best stories you've ever played are the ones you wrote yourself, you should get this game.  \n\nSomewhere in the expansive base game, 3 adjustable AI directors with an infinite amount more in the mods, the 3 sizable DLC's (all of which are wholly worth it, Ideology and Biotech most of all if you're on a budget, with Biotech being a personal favorite), and the absolutely absurd pile of mods that might outstrip titans like Skyrim at this point, you WILL find a way you enjoy playing. You will then sink in like the rest of us. Sink in to all the stories you never knew you could write just trying to keep people alive. \n\nBless this game.", "timestamp_created": 1680519820, "timestamp_updated": 1680519820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.873784482479095459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139764373": {"recommendationid": "139764373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099986067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 28455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28270, "last_played": 1694484171}, "language": "english", "review": "Are you hungry? Do you like \"evolving stories\" written in the blood of your enemies? Are you mentally and emotionally stable?\n\nIf you can answer any of these questions, you should already be playing RimWorld.\n\nRimworld (I'm not capitalizing the W every time) is a game made by a man named Tynan and his cohorts for the express purpose of wasting all of your free time, and is one of the few games made to sell a book, a soundtrack, and a cute plushie. But what is Rimworld? \n\nWell judging by my meager almost-700 hours, I don't know. And that concerns me. Every time I play I black out and come to several hours later with blood on my hands and a pristine prison with very \"happy\" slaves. So far the police haven't caught me, but I'm not holding my breath\n\nIn Rimworld, you are the proprietor of a small group of nuggets colloquially known as pawns, each with strengths and differences depending on their personality, divided between a childhood and adulthood. Depending on your pawn's traits, you'll have a completely different experience between groups, from Pyromaniacs to Sanguine Mountain Lovers to flesh eating Cannibals. But before you pick your pawns, you need to pick your Storyteller. \n\nRimworld is a game that lies and says its a \"fictional story generator.\" So is the (insert disliked political group) but we're all just playing games at the end of the day. Being as such, we need a Storyteller. Without glorious mods, we have three default, Cassandra Classic, Phoebe Chillax, and Randy. Cassandra works in a similar way to the Director in Left 4 Dead. She'll generate events that present a constant stress, until hitting you with something big, then relaxing for a while. Just because she's listed first doesn't make her easy. Phoebe, while more relaxing than Cassandra, can still be just as difficult. However she tends to leave more time between large raids for you to build back. Finally, the one you'll choose, Randy Random. He doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about your colony, he just wants to send 10 stacks of corn from the sky on a daily basis. Your storyteller will make the events happen, but your response to them is what makes your story. After picking Randy, you can generate your world\n\nYou'll generate a world based off a keyword, and you'll have to choose a tile to start on. Choosing where you start is an artform and, just like AI generated art, will probably end up killing you some day. Wherever you choose you'll likely be somewhat close to another faction, which will also end up killing you some day. While there are many types of faction, Being near neutral or friendly factions is probably better than raiders, however you'll deprive yourself of the easy food source raider corpses are.\n\nWherever you choose, whichever pawns you pick, you'll start with next to nothing but the clothes on your pawns backs and a smattering of materials. You'll want to start planning out a base. Ordering your pawns to do productive tasks to bring your colony into existence is a long journey, and if you picked Cassandra, you'll be dead in ten days anyway from the wild pack of man-eating squirrels rapidly approaching your location. So you better start planning that graveyard too! \n\nStart with a building for everyone to sleep, of which will need to be roofed with beds or at least sleeping spots for everyone. A stove for cooking those squirrels will help too. Plan out a growing area on good, fertile soil for some crops to have renewable food without having to compete with that brown bear living in the southeast corner. Plan out the weed farm, make a few more buildings for production and research, and keep building up. When those squirrels finally come for you, you might just be able to survive it. Unlikely, but Rome wasn't built in a day. \n\nTending your pawns needs for recreation, food, and rest are important. A happy pawn is a pawn that isn't killing your other pawns because he didn't get breakfast in time. However pawns are generally easily entertained. They're quite content with missing the horseshoe pin by a mile and stabbing their fingers off with that knife game thing. Better materials, weapons, and tools comes with higher expectations, so constantly improving your recreation facilities and overall base is a must to keep pawns from the whole aforementioned killing each other.\n\nEventually you'll experience random events, from bandit raids to Randy's corn rain to every squirrel on the map going mad and chewing off your pawn's toes. Prepare for everything and somehow you'll still find a way to fail. Failure tells a good story just like triumph, and you can't buy Tynan's book without understanding that. However there is a win condition. Several, in fact. I'll leave those for you to find however... you've grown quite fond of this place, haven't you? Maybe you should stay a little while longer...\n\n200 hours in, you'll understand why 20 hours in you thought this game would be addicting after 2 hours. Much like crack, you'll probably want to take a cold shower after you find out the horrible things you did during that brief high. At work the next day you'll be unconsciously humming the relaxing music and waiting to get home to play a few hours. Those few hours will turn to days, those days, weeks. Your job will fire you, your family will call you and you won't answer because you're watching your crafter build a shiny new bionic leg because your best soldier and your pacifist medic got into an argument about the squirrels and the soldier headbutted your medic's leg so hard it exploded, which caused her to take opium for the pain, which caused her addiction to opium, but we don't have any opium so now she's having a tantrum and her only way to blow off steam is to punch your live mortar shells until they expl-\n\nAnd that's how I lost my first colony. Maybe this game [i] is [/i] about story generation. That or Tynan just wants me to buy his damn book. Either way I give RimWorld my highest recommendation. You didn't deserve the lifespan you spend playing it, much like myself. Tynan does, however, and he'll live forever with them. At the end of the day, you'll tell some wild-ass stories to your very confused coworkers. A game so good that I decided to buy it after playing for 200-ish hours, along with all the expansions. It's just that good. My only criticism being its made by Canadians, whom don't exist.\n\nA final note, while you can definitely tell its a Unity game, its well optimized and doesn't have those weird audio issues I've personally had with other Unity games. It's also very moddable, with hundreds of fantastic mods on the Smeme Workshop and the developer's forums, including a multiplayer mod for all you friend-havers. Play it, buy Tynan's book, skip your funeral to play more RimWorld, repeat the cycle.", "timestamp_created": 1686279211, "timestamp_updated": 1686279211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 139, "votes_funny": 54, "weighted_vote_score": "0.872895121574401855", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126526241": {"recommendationid": "126526241", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999215804", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 21238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9511, "last_played": 1685393331}, "language": "english", "review": "RimWorld. Herald of many memes. Taker of things we did not want to lose. Jester of that fist fight with a rabbit destroying someones eyeballs.\n\nRimWorld rides a fine line that is between an experiment and game. Between a fully fleshed out world and an open ended interpretation you have to fill in with imagination. RimWorld never truly has enough graphical fidelity to be clear about what you are looking at, but you will fill in the blanks.\n\nI have format I try to adhere to when reviewing games. RimWorld does not conform to what I would describe as an average game. So instead, allow me to do what RimWorld does best: Tell a story.\n\n----------\nMy game started with the crash landed, three survivors. Under an extremely hot sun, they toiled taking shifts to survive the extreme desert they found themselves in. They were desperate to get a roof over their heads and create a sanctuary against the heat. In the distance, a drop pod came crashing down. The most qualified doctor was sent to retrieve the survivor, if there was one. Upon inspection of the unfortunate soul, he discovered it was his wife!\n\nKnowing that death was only hours away, he began frantically treating her bloody wounds. Afterwards, he began the excruciating task of carrying her back to base. He even gave up his bed to speed up her healing and ensure her the best chance of survival. The following day, it was discovered that she had an infection. A disastrous side effect from immediate treatment in the desert and not a cleaner room.\n\nDays passed. Her husband stayed with her every day when his tasks were over. He fed her by hand, bite by bite. He cheered her up while she attempted to fight off the fever. She reminisced with him about times and events the others were not privy to, nor invited to learn about. Eventually, the fever broke and she recovered well enough to walk.\n\nWhat words were shared between those two, none know. I can only imagine her bittersweet smile towards her husband when she left. All we know is she headed North, back to the group she was currently helping with. Perhaps her people need her just as badly as we need our doctor. I will never know.\n----------\n\nThat was about 40 minutes of my game. This experience leads my recommendation and it will stay with me far longer than any triple-A game on the market because it was organic and emergent. You just do not get this in other games that have structured stories.\n\nRimWorld is a story generator as well as a game. The event chosen was a normal RNG event of a crash landed survivor. Mechanically, the game is trying to give you another colonist for task balancing. However, through the random assignments it also chose to make her the wife of one of my current colonists who happened to be my doctor. Her recruitment was also not guaranteed. Maybe one day in the future, I would have seen his wife again.\n\nOther games do not do this. They never provide you with enough bread crumbs for you to fill in the rest of the gaps. \n\nIf you are willing to get through a rather steep learning curve, you can experience these scenarios as well. Fill in the gaps the way you want to. Create your own stories.\n\nEdits: Spelling/grammar -- I am also reviewing each expansion.

The base game is really good, there are THOUSANDS of amazing mods that expand upon the game in ways that you want. Looking for more animals? Alien species? New types of weapons? It's all there. Plus tons of quality of life changes. Want your pawns to be able to move AND shoot at the same time? Not build themselves into corners? Clear doorways of garbage? There's a mod for all of those!\n\nGraphics are not RimWorld's strong point, but the depth of simulation is what's important. You have to keep your units (called \"pawns\") alive with shelter and clothing, food and medicine, and weapons to thwart wild animals, alien insects, murderous robots, and other raiding colonies. There is a steep learning curve, but its fun to learn about new quirks about the game each time you boot it up, new layouts or plans in base construction, or strategies in defenses.\n\nDon't go in thinking this is a game you have to beat. This is a game you enjoy, even when you lose. Did the AI send four raids at you in two days and just overwhelm you? Did your pawns get the plague on day 2 and expire because you didn't have any medicine? Or are you on year 11 and your super-leveled pawn took a random arrow from a tribal raider to the eye that one shot their brain? You remember these moments, these stories, and the pawns involved. That's what makes the game fun, is how wild and chaotic the events in the game can lead to crazy outcomes that just make you laugh at the absurdity. Ever seen someone die to 36 rabid guinea pigs nibbling them to death? Or two people get into a scuffle and one of them rips off the other's arm? Go into a sad state of psychotic wandering when their wife has an affair and underground insects devour them?\n\nThe DLCs are all very good, adding more depth to the game, and allowing you to carve out a more personal experience. Ideology adds \"religion\" to the game, allowing you to further tailor make your gameplay. Want an entire colony of cannibals without having to give everyone the Cannibal trait? Now you can, if they follow your Cannibal Religion, they'll wear human leather and eat human meat no problem! You can min max your religion for things like increased research speed, not caring about corpses laying about (no mood penalties!) and happy to wear button down shirts for a mood boost (you were going to dress them in those anyway!) Plus, specialty roles, like the Crafting Specialist, can make your group even more efficient!\n\nRoyalty adds psychic powers to the game, plus a Galactic Nobility system. You can call in favors from the Galactic Empire with enough honor earned from quest, and use powers like Farskip to teleport around the map. Probably the weakest DLC in my opinion, but it is fun to have \"caster\" style units, an element from Real Time Strategy games like Starcraft or Warcraft brought over to RimWorld. Plus, the story and attachment you get from having a pawn with a noble rank is great.\n\nBioTech released not too long ago, and its more expensive than the other two DLCs, but it adds almost a whole other RimWorld amount of content on top of the base game. Pawns can have children, children can be raised and guided into mastering different skills, and with the genetic system in the game, genes can be passed on to offspring. Genes are just like traits, except they're inheritable, and also, they seem to stack with traits. Fast walker and Jogger for super quick pawns. Robust and Tough for nigh unkillable units. Genes also add alien Xenotypes to the game, prebuilt genetically modified pawns, with extra abilities and focused development. Genies are great crafters, but terrible soldiers. Yttakin are faster when naked, can summon animals to help in battle, but have a higher need for sleep. Finally, you can craft and control your own army of robot Mechanoids, and there is a \"boss\" progression of summoning other Mechanoids to fight, destroy, and research, to expand upon your own army.\n\nTL;DR: RimWorld is an amazing strategy/simulator/management game. Strong base game, great DLC, and lots of mods make it easily modifiable to your preferences. Rarely goes on sale, Ludeon Studios know they have the best base management/colony simulator game out there, so if you see it for 20% off that's the best deal you're ever going to see. You can check the history if you don't believe me. You can pay $70 for an AAA game that you'll finish in 30-40 hours and have limited repeatability, or you can spend $35 and have hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of gameplay, where the story is the journey from first crash landing, how you survive, and eventually escape.", "timestamp_created": 1672687556, "timestamp_updated": 1672687556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85829085111618042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145227921": {"recommendationid": "145227921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798929367", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 9240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 570, "playtime_at_review": 3055, "last_played": 1696365641}, "language": "english", "review": "while intimidating at first, this is a great game to play while you have a video/tv show playing in the background", "timestamp_created": 1693266196, "timestamp_updated": 1693266196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855099141597747803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135896995": {"recommendationid": "135896995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167531430", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 11540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11540, "last_played": 1667658849}, "language": "english", "review": "John is having a Tantrum.\n\nHe is going to Destroy Nuclear Warhead x1.\n\nThis happened because of poor mood.\n\nthe final straw was: Ate without Table", "timestamp_created": 1680372340, "timestamp_updated": 1680372340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 149, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85371476411819458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132849493": {"recommendationid": "132849493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144345124", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 62651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 30261, "last_played": 1695634333}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great.\n\nI kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam.

I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

I don't have the prettiest bases, the strongest weapons, the fanciest throne room, whatever. But the thing you should understand about RW if you're on the fence about it is that yeah, it's a game, it does have a handful of win conditions, but more than that, [b]it's a story generator[/b]. The story can be as high or as low-stakes as you want to make it, and if you're enjoying it, congratulations, you won RimWorld regardless of any other consideration. Even if your goal is to get your colony into space and you succeed, you can just keep playing with the remaining colony members on the planet, if any. In a completely dead colony, you can quite literally just watch time pass until you get a random joining colonist event and begin play again. The end is never the end until you decide it is.\n\nThere's a learning curve for sure, but in my estimation it's not as punishing as other games in the colony-manager genre. Assigning tasks and areas is fairly straightforward. Most of the real difficulty comes from learning to manage your wealth so that you don't accidentally have massive raids steamroll you before you're ready to handle them, learning to manage passive defenses so that when raids do show up you aren't overwhelmed, and learning to design efficient bases so you aren't wasting half your colonists' day running across the map for a handful of wood. Once you've got those down, you're already halfway there.\n\nAnyway, on the hypothetical list of games I'd take with me to a deserted island, or in this case a space colony on the edge of the known universe, RimWorld easily makes the list, which is just about the highest praise I can think of for a game.", "timestamp_created": 1686706026, "timestamp_updated": 1686706026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850193560123443604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142193143": {"recommendationid": "142193143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063952731", "num_games_owned": 2517, "num_reviews": 341, "playtime_forever": 5025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5025, "last_played": 1687979436}, "language": "english", "review": "Your spaceship crashes on a planet and you need to survive and build a new spaceship to return back to space.

This is his story.[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[i]My name is [b]Aaron Hughes[/b] I'm 26 years old, an ex-soldier, criminal, coward and now a ship-crash survivor. It was all so fast. I remember the sudden shift in the passenger lounge, the confusion. Then, the chaos. All alarms blaring and people screaming. I remember running, as the ship shifted and groaned as if the very ground below me would open and I'd be sucked into the cold void. If not for that escape pod, maybe that would have happened.\n\nI lost consciousness during re-entry and don't remember much. The first thing i remember is waking up surrounded by fire and debris to which I found a few others had survived.[b]Liz, Brodie, Patrick and Livvy[/b] were their names and being the only friendly faces for a couple hundred miles we decided to stick together. We spent much of the first month getting our things in order. I took this time to learn more about our group and feel out who they were and if they could be trusted. Liz was first. She was a young Latin-American girl and a wiz with anything technical. Be it construction or assembling and dis-assembling anything mechanical she could do it. Apparently she use to work on the ship as a technician, working on the engine and overseeing basic systems. I asked about what had happened but she knew very little. Next was Brodie, he was a bit harder. He was a Mexican-american man with a brash attitude and a tough guy persona. From the very little i gleaned from him I learned he was an ex-convict with ties to a mid-rim marauder gang I'd heard about. I knew enough that I shouldn't pry to much and moved on. The next ones came as a pair, Patrick and Livvy. \n\nYou couldn't have seen a more starker difference in these two. Patrick was a shy, depressive boy while Livvy was a bubbly, cheerful girl. I guess opposites attract because these two had formed a rather close friendship. I don't know how but they did. I pried deeper and found Patrick to be an avid gamer, always talking about Shout of War campaigns and the Dread: Forever Soundtrack. It was humours but tiresome to a point. Livvy on the other hand use to be an Actor and a child star to boot! I vaguely remember a show I watched a while back that had a girl that looked like her in it so I took her word for it. She was sweet, kind and all and all an amazing girl. She would talk about her favourite shows and actors. Productions that she'd been in and anything musical related would set her off like a voice activated bomb! These two were inseparable. Walking together, talking together, playing horseshoes together. There wasn't anything these two wouldn't do together. I don't know what it was, maybe the increased time together or the many hours spent cuddled up by the fire but soon this friendship, turned into a relationship. It took some convincing from me and Brodie, who by this point had warmed up to us, to convince him to ask her. Eventually he went up and stammered out a few words about \"Happiness\" and I think something to do with her ears? We'd thought he'd blown it, and yet Livvy stood there for a few seconds letting us all sit in the moment of awkward silence before simply taking his face and gently kissing him. I swear you could have heard our screams of elation from the Alpha sector!    \n\nAs the time moved on we began to become more organised. We got a stable roof over our heads thanks to Liz and game was plentiful so Livvy went out hunting, she'd done tons of action movies apparently but you couldn't argue with her shooting skills. As the days went by and we began settling in for the long hall, I took to farming. I grew up on a colony world and knew my way around a hoe and plow and set about growing some carrots and potatoes. Things began to look up , yes we had our set backs but we'd survived! We believed that nothing could stop us, how wrong we were.\n\nOne day i decided to take over for Livvy on hunting duty as the crop had just been harvested and the fields re-sown so i was out of work. I also thought I'd let the two love birds spend some time together as Livvy spent alot of time away from camp, only returning in the twilight hours to rest and resupply. Really didn't leave much in the way of quality time. So I picked up my revolver and set out to hunt some small game. I was nary gone an hour when I heard the first shots. Even now I can still hear them.[b]BOOM[/b].[b]BOOM[/b].[b]BOOM[/b]. I dropped everything and run as fast as i could. It reminded me of the ship and the fear i felt then, returned. I got sight of the house an approached it's outer western wall and followed it along and as I rounded the corner I saw it. Massive, covered in brown fur and standing on it's hind legs. A Grizzly Bear. It turned to me, mouth caked in blood and that's when i saw her, Livvy. She was Lying face down, rifle next to her, covered in blood. At that moment I felt a rage that I had never experienced. I raised my gun and the beast charged. I fired everything i had into it and in a flash it lay dead before me. I didn't savour the victory as I rushed to Livvy faster than sound and began to carry her to the medical room. I screamed for Liz to grab the First Aid kits as I laid her down on the bed. I began to bandage her but it was to late, she had lost to much blood. She died in my arms. We found Patrick curled up in a ball in their bedroom, the poor boy was terrified. Apparently while he was out tending to the animals the bear had attacked him and he'd retreated to the house. Livvy met him outside, gun in hand, and had told him to go inside and to not come out no matter what he hears. That poor boy had to listen as that bear ripped his fiance apart. Every scream, every crunch, every squelch  and then silence. \n\nWe gave her a good send off. Buried her right in front of the house she helped build. We tried to move on but nothing could fill the hole she left behind. Liz buried herself in her papers and schematics, Brodie wouldn't speak to anyone, especially Patrick. He blamed him for cowering in the room while his wife died just outside. Patrick was hit the worst, he would spend day wandering not doing anything and when confronted attacked Brodie! It took all of my strength to detain the kid! He would spend days locked way refusing to eat or speak to anyone. We decided that the guns would be carried by myself and Brodie to prevent anything tragic. And I? I tended my Garden. Livvy would sometimes come up to the farm to help me pick strawberries and peaches and She'd laugh when ladybugs and butterflies would land on my hat. Everyday I miss her, we all do. This is my way of honouring her memory. \n\nYesterday Marked a year since we forcefully touched down on this planet and we've come along way. We've began trading with other settlements, fended off attacks from hostile forces and even set up and outpost nearby! The groups doing a lot better as well! Liz has come around and helps in the garden from time-to-time and Brodie has begun to venture out to search for nearby stashes and look for a way for us to leave this planet. The thought of Livvy still weighs heavy on Patrick's mind as it does for all of us. He began meditating regularly and seeks my council when times are tough. He's not fully ready but he's making progress. This year has been a strange turn of events for all of us. We have experienced extreme highs and staggering lows and yet we push on! For our our friends! for our loved ones! For Livvy.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nThis game was able in only 17 hrs craft that kind of story.

I thought I knew what I was getting into when I got this game... I thought I was well prepared... My first real base was a fairly big mountain complex that just happened to have a big open air area with lots of grass in the center. What luck, I thought! I could eventually put my solar farm here, an animal pen, maybe even artillery where it was all secreted away from prying eyes. Turns out this would be my downfall. After many hardships, raids, and quests though I was becoming quite proud of the now self sufficient underground complex my little colonists had been creating. Complete with hydroponics, layered automatic defenses, armed and armored colonists, kill boxes, and only one way in I thought my mountain fortress was impenetrable. I figured heck I wouldn\u2019t even have to do anything at this point, I could just give the colonists the wheel. I decided to put that to the test. \n\nWithin maybe half an hour nearly everyone was dead. It was almost as if Randy had suddenly decided to punish me for my hubris. To remind me that no one on my land is ever truly safe. It wasn\u2019t even hard for him.\n TL;DR 10/10 would totally anger Randy again.\n\nWhat happened: \nLiterally about a minute into my silly experiment, a dry winter thunderstorm struck one of the solar panels in the middle of the night, blowing it up and causing a fire. My denizens immediately sprang into action, but they had to get through a series of heavy doors to reach the fire. When they were nearly there, the fire reached a wooden column holding up a roof over a large battery bank. When the roof collapsed it crushed the batteries causing a massive explosion which blew open a nearby wall instantly killing 2 of the responding colonists on the other side. The lights and heating then went out as a vital power line had been severed. Fire then spread to the animal pen where I was keeping, admittedly, a few dozen too many boomrats, who then scurried out into the fires.\n\nThe remaining colonists stumbled onto a chaotic scene of fire with random explosions everywhere. As casualties began to mount, the wounded were being taken to a cold, dark infirmary where the only two highly skilled doctors got to work. At this moment, a large infestation appeared in one of the dorms and while this wouldn\u2019t have been a huge problem with the help of the turrets, everything was still offline. Slowly, the bugs began to dismantle everything including the unpowered defenses and walls which was also causing random cave-ins. The two dead colonists in the destroyed hallway were also really putting everyone on edge and the random explosions, burns, and freezing cold weren\u2019t helping. The colonists began to lose it, one even ran out to the outer perimeter fence to pick a fight with a guard dog. Another began wandering aimlessly and happened to open the exact wrong door and was immediately decapitated by giant bugs for it.\n\nSuddenly now with some direction, the bugs began to charge the door the man came through and burst into the main hallway. The base\u2019s only two doctors had been passing by to get medicine and to their credit they tried to open fire on the bugs but were quickly and surgically killed with a stab to the brain and heart. I may have overestimated the protective abilities of the plate armor and helmet. From there the bugs simply hunted the wounded down in the dark, freezing hallways of the collapsing mountain base as most of the crew tried to get the solar farm situation back under control. I found the guy that went crazy earlier outside the outer fence laying on the grass bleeding out near the guard dog which was also bleeding out. It must have quite the sight for the tribal raiders that came right after.\n\nI like to think that as the tribals arrived on scene to witness a mountain caving in on itself with fires all around, bug chittering sounds and the occasional explosion echoing in the distance they found the last barely conscious survivor whispering to himself, \u201cRandy\u2026 why\u2026\u201d before carrying him away. Probably believing they were doing him a favor at that point. Goddamn Randy Random, you gotta love/hate this story teller.

Sounds like a scam to me.\"\n\nWell, as it turns out, I bought it anyway. And for what the $30 is worth?\n\nIt's a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 scam.\n\nThe game plays out where you have a couple people on a ship, or something, and crashlanding into what is pretty much a space version of the wild west.\n\nThese pawns are what pretty much what you use to play the game. You essentially kind of psudeo-control these pawns that don't have functioning brains, and you set up schedules, work priorities, all that colony simulator stuff. The entire game is just based around managing your colony; at least, that's what my first impressions were.\n\nA random bandit raid comes 30 minutes into the game. Only one guy. Probably a self-proclaimed pirate. No big deal, my pawns just gunned him down.\n\nNow, we have this unslightly guy outside of our base, bleeding out because he thought he could 1v3 my colony like he was some Metal Gear assassin sort of guy.\n\nOh, then I checked his stats.\n\nYou see, in this game, pawns have these designated stats that are all trainable. These stats are sort of like an RPG trope ordeal where you have to train them at those skills so they get better stats. The pawns I started out with, one was an okay constructor, the other a doctor, and the third one was not good at anything, but she could still kind of get the job done.\n\nNow, this pirate?\n\nHe had the most atrocious stats I have ever seen in my life. In fact, he was only good at one thing, which was punching. Couldn't even help with the farm or anything because he was 'incapable' of doing so. Any sort of skilled labor just wasn't his thing.\n\nStill, I decided to tidy him up, and try to recruit him. After all, you may be only good at one thing, but we sure as hell need a janitor to clean these dirty as hell rooms, since the dirt and grime was pretty much pissing off my pawn's moodlet bars.\n\nFew hours go by, and I'm already invested into this brawler janitor guy. You see, my colonists wanted everything. They wanted a good looking bedroom, a place to lounge in, some horseshoes to play with, but not the janitor dude.\n\nHe was an ascetic. Gave him a garbage room with dirt as his floor and an awful bed. He didn't mind it. No, in fact, he was happy with it. This guy pretty much never had a crappy mood and just did his work, no questions asked. Cleaned the kitchen, the dining room, the bedrooms, the farms, the outside, without a single complaint. I liked him. He was cool.\n\nOur colony started booming. Naturally, when any colony starts to get rolling, they start rolling hard. And when the colony gets rolling, the money starts rolling right in.\n\nYou see, we were the biggest dealer in corn that the world had ever seen. Every time a trading caravan from a neighboring colony came in, we got ourselves a giant wad of cash for every harvest of every year. And with that giant wad of cash, as any functional human being would do, we started spending that on a bunch of cool as hell stuff.\n\nShield belts. Charge rifles. Bionic body parts. Gigantic statues. And of course, an EXCESS amount of chocolate. Because why the hell not.\n\nWell, of course, since we were pretty much balling on money, people started to take notice. And, unfortunately, not all of them were good people.\n\nPirate raids started to come in, and we fought them off every time. Every time we finished a raid, we'd go ahead, and try to recruit some of these guys. Some of them joined, others were still hesitant. Sooner or later, we had a massive prison size of 11 people, and 7 people as colonists. With that population, food was bound to dwindle, but I figured that it wouldn't have mattered since we were in a tropical rain forest, where food was everywhere, and farming season was pretty much all the time.\n\nI was woefully unprepared for the events to come.\n\nSome other city thought that it was an absolute GENIUS idea to use their chemical radioactive fuel or whatever, and as it turned out, it wasn't so genius after all. My entire region was poisoned. By toxic fallout.\n\nThing is, it's impossible to grow crops outside in a toxic fallout. So my entire crop system started dying out.\n\nWell, I figured, maybe we can hold out on food stores for a while, and I did just that.\n\nFood stores cut in half after the first week. Toxic fallout wasn't letting up any time soon, so I was forced to let go of the prisoners outside to fend for themselves. My colony was going to be eaten out of food, and I wasn't going to let my colonists starve just to feed some idiots who do not understand the gloriousness of my colony.\n\nLuckily for me, the fallout lifted right before our food stores would hit zero. Of course, right after that happened, I started hauling ass, telling my pawns to get to work farming right away so we would have food again.\n\nThen, a ship crashlands straight into the north side of my base.\n\nI had no idea what that thing was. It sat there for a few days, humming some weird crap, then I noticed that it was making snow. And killing plants around it.\n\nIt was the same \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 'toxic fallout' thing, but this time, it was spreading from the ship.\n\nI hated toxic fallout. It forced me to let go of all the prisoners I was about to recruit. It made me lose farming time that could have been spent farming corn.\n\nSo naturally, with my hate for this poison ship, I woke up my colonists, and then attacked the ship.\n\nWhat happened next, I couldn't believe it.\n\nRobot aliens. Counted 4 super-sized centipede slug things and 5 scyther robot things. I have never seen robot aliens up until this point, so I had no idea what these things were capable of.\n\nWe started shooting them down.\n\nThe mechanoids were not fazed.\n\nOne of the scythers took a shot. Aimed it. Fired.\n\nMy best shooter instantly died as the charged weapon shredded his brains out.\n\nI was forced to move retreat back to the base, where the sandbags were so they could take cover.\n\nMeanwhile, the centipedes just arrived as reinforcements after the scythers were sniping my main defending force off one by one.\n\nThe centipedes started mowing everyone down; colonists died left and right.\n\nThe only people left at this point was the doctor, who was bleeding out fast, and the janitor, who was rescuing the doctor to the hospital.\n\nIn a last ditch effort to try to save what I had left, I sent my janitor to rush into the fray.\n\nAs he charged in, a scyther instantly broke his shield with a well-timed shot. The janitor cleanly swiped off the scyther's neck, downing it, and then moved onto the next scyther.\n\nA bystanding scyther, watching this take place, takes fire only to accidentally shoot his ally directly in the thorax.\n\nWith it down, he moved towards the last scyther.\n\nThis time wasn't so lucky for him.\n\nThe fourth scyther sliced at his right arm, destroying it, as the scyther dodged his attacks, and sliced again at his neck, swiftly decapitating his head clean off.\n\nIn a manner of minutes, my entire colony was dismantled. The buildings were razed in an inferno, and all my colonists had died, save for one. The doctor, whimpering in the corner of the hospital; the floor soaked in her own blood.\n\nI watched for the last few minutes as she bled out, and died right there. Alone, as the building around her burnt into ashes and crumbled.\n\nI felt bad. My colony was short-lived. I thought I had it all. I thought I was invincible. Hell, I survived a toxic fallout. Of course I thought I was invincible. And I was so invested into that colony too.\n\nSo, I decided. This game is a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 scam. What kind of sane developer makes me feel this emotion, in a video game no less? A crook, that's who. For $30, you made me suffer. You made me addicted to this game, to the point where I have played for a total of 300 hours as of this review.\n\nAll I can say, Tynan Sylvester, is that you are a crook.

I have over 100 hours in it and will probably log some more, but most of the time I can't really tell if I'm even having fun. It sells itself as a story generator, but none of the stories are all that interesting. For starters, I love games like Gnomoria and Dwarf Fortress, it's exactly my type of thing. I like managing things and creating a setting in which an interesting story can take place. But RimWorld is not that.\n\nSo RimWorld has a so-called \"Story teller AI\", which is a fancy term for event script. This AI determines when events like raids, disease, breakdowns, drones, etc. happen. There are 3 AI by default, only 2 of them worth mentioning. One is just an RNG, it does things regardless of the gamestate. The other tries to be \"interesting\" and make events happen based on what your colony is like.\n\nThe issue with the \"interesting\" AI is that it's very predictable. You have a lot of food stocked up, so your freezer will fail in some way and it will rot. You have a lot of components stocked up, so expect every device to repeatedly break down. It's more or less \"if the player is doing well in this regard, make them not do well\". This leads to you just gaming the system and living on the edge of ruin at all times to avoid these events. If this were a story, it would be a terrible fanfic where the writer's OC is just ruthlessly abused for no reason. Hence, I use the random AI.\n\nNow there are many events in RimWorld, but few really give you many options, which is its main failing as a story generator. If there is a raid, you must fight them. If one of your colonists goes on a rampage, your options are to attack them or let them attack you. If there is radiation, you stay inside. If there is a cold snap, you hunt for food. If there is a physic drone, you just endure it. The game is asking you a question, and both of you know what the answer is. If you do not know the answer, you fail. This barely creates a story, simply a list of events that happened independently of each other.\n\nNow to the next thing; fights are utterly boring and unbalanced. Most bullets will spray wildly off to the side of their target, even if the gun is of an excellent quality and the shooter is of a high level. Firefights are just bullets wizzing around randomly, and sometimes a bullet hitting something is the end of the fight. Your heavily armoured sniper can be instantly killed by a bandit with an old pistol, meanwhile the sniper shot and missed 6 times. The reverse can also happen, of course, but the point is that the fights are quite unsatisfying, they take ages yet are over in a second.\n\nThis brings me to my final point; animals. It feels like a majority of the events I ever see are manhunting animals, or animals who otherwise decide to attack my colonists despite better options. Many times the game will spawn a pack of small manhunting animals, and I have to decide there if I risk fighting them or just accept that I can't leave my walls for a few days. Even 2 manhunting rats can get someone killed due to the lack of gun accuracy. If you have turrets, you must also turn these off so they don't wildly spray at the animals and get targeted, as even a single manhunting monkey can cause a turret to explode. This isn't fun and doesn't make for an interesting story, I mean maybe it's funny the first time, but the game wears this joke out very fast.\n\nCase in point; my last colony. 3 people, one non-violent, so two gunners. A pistol and a rifle. Literally nothing happened for 90% of the colony except some cargo pods. Then a manhunting monkey. Okay, we got 3 lucky shots and downed it. Then 2 manhunting rabbits, we killed one and the other one bit a finger off the rifle guy, okay great but whatever, we killed both rabbits. At this point I'm really wanting another colonist so I can do more, a quest arrives to rescue someone so I decide I'll do it. My base is well defended, with the only way in going through a nest of insects, so I feel safe sending my two gunners and leaving my pacifist home to tend to the base. One day into the journey, my caravan is attacked by manhunting chinchillas. I try to run, but they are too fast, so I turn to fight. My pistol guy shoots 4 rounds, all miss. My rifle guy shoots 2 rounds, all miss. The chinchillas then slaughter them. Back at base, 2 manhunting rats have spawned and saw my only colonist entering a door. The two rats break down the wooden door and kill him. A man in black arrives and kills the rats. He is incapable of dumb labour so at this point the game is over. A panther decides to hunt him for sport, he had no chance to run, shot and missed with 3 rounds and died. That's more or less this game, the only stories you'll really generate are dumb ones such as the above. I have seen all stages of the game and it seemingly never evolves past these petty events, and it really explains why a majority of the stories people have of this game are either butchering humans or having some wacky animal wipe them out.", "timestamp_created": 1671304738, "timestamp_updated": 1671304738, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723603188991546631", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147049748": {"recommendationid": "147049748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003965722", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 125158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8339, "playtime_at_review": 118380, "last_played": 1696544662}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't in good faith recommend this game to anyone.

I joined the colony of Jemberry's Oasis a few days ago, after they rescued me from a pirate raid. They seemed nice enough, and they had a decent base with electricity, farming, and even a research bench. They said they needed more hands to help with the work and defend against the dangers of this planet.\n\nI was eager to prove myself, so I volunteered for the first task they gave me: hauling some wood from the nearby forest. It sounded easy enough, until I saw the forest. It was full of giant spiders, man-eating plants, and other horrors that made me wish I had stayed with the pirates. I grabbed a few logs and ran back to the base, hoping none of those things would follow me.\n\nThe next day, they asked me to help with the cooking. I thought that would be safer, until I saw what they were cooking. Apparently, they had run out of normal food, so they had resorted to eating human meat. They said it was either that or starve, and that it wasn\u2019t so bad once you got used to it. They offered me a plate of human stew, but I politely declined. I think I\u2019ll stick to the berries I found in the forest.\n\nThe day after that, they asked me to join them for a raid on a nearby enemy outpost. They said it was a good opportunity to get some loot and revenge. They gave me a pistol and some armor, and told me to follow their lead. We sneaked up to the outpost, and waited for the signal to attack. Then, everything went wrong. The outpost had turrets, traps, and mortars that we didn\u2019t expect. We were outnumbered and outgunned. Half of our team was killed or wounded in the first few minutes. The rest of us retreated, but not before I got shot in the leg.\n\nNow I\u2019m lying in a hospital bed, waiting for someone to patch me up. The doctor said I might lose my leg, but he could replace it with a bionic one if we had the resources. He also said he could install some other enhancements, like a neural implant or a painstopper. He said it would make me more efficient and happy. He smiled as he said that, but his smile looked more like a grin.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think I can survive on this rim world much longer. Maybe I should try to escape, or join another faction, or just end it all. But then again, maybe things will get better. Maybe the colony will grow and prosper, and we\u2019ll find a way to leave this planet.

I enjoy playing it, but on its own, it's also a rather simple game, with plenty of limitations, and imperfections. The main quality the game has going on for it are the thousands of mods freely available in the workshop. I myself used to enjoy playing with anywhere from 200 to 500 mods at a time, creating my own lists, tailoring my game experience to my tastes. Very few games out there allow you to do this. It's great.\n\nThen the DLCs arrived. Sure, they're optional, and with Royalty it was still possible to find almost any mod out there that would work even if you didn't own the DLC. Ideology made things a little bit worse, now many mods relied on the new mechanics to work. Still, these DLCs were expensive relative to the base game price, and added little original content of their own, but eventually I bought them just so that I could play the game with my mods as I used to do before.\n\nQue Biotech. Biotech rips off a few mods' ideas, packages them for about 75% of the base game price, and completely breaks almost all mods out there that I used to enjoy. I refuse to have to pay almost as much as the base game I already bought to be able to play as I used to do previously. Unfortunately, most mods won't be updated or mantained for those who do not own all the DLCs. Legacy versions slowly disappear and large modlists are now simply broken and unplayable.

At it's core it is a story telling game, the staring scenario my be the same for each new play through but it very quickly develops it's unique identity. Weather from numerous enemy threats, Mechanoid or more fleshy in form; individual character traits each colonist possess and the way those traits affect social interaction with others; the sometimes brutal climate; power over load explosions; more recently toxic pollution. There is a huge amount to try and manage to mitigate risk and ensure the survival of of your colony, and when you think you have it all under control, an out-brake of plague takes down your only qualified cook and half of your colony dies of starvation before the the other half turn to cannibalism.\n\nI've spent many hours playing this game and the DLC's and I have no complaints about the value I have revived for money spent. It's a game I will continue to play and enjoy. The game is not perfect though and the more you play the more ideas you have of what to add to game to make it even better, like any good engaging game would. Personally I would love to see the ability of being able to assign prisoners to specific cells/beds, as you can with regular colonists and slaves. Especially since Biotech prisoners are so important for so many reasons, it would be nice to group prisoners with a shared destiny's together. Insulated walls would be a cool addition for use around freezers especially, thermal management is one of many base planing characteristics you tinker with to aspire to perfection and never perfect. One of my minor irritations is lack of ability to assign food to animals. The amount of times I have seen a doctor stroll though a freezer of fresh rice to go and grab a Lavish meal (most expensive meal in the game) to feed to sick elephant, it makes no sense. \n\nMy biggest irritation by far is the caravan forming mechanic to go on to the world map or lack of. This is how it goes, set a caravan at 4 am, most of guys are close to fully rested, lots of time to get together supplies before anybody gets tired, don't need too much for a few nights.  A bed roll each, maybe 50 meals, a few meds, a recreation item or two incase colonists get bored at a stop over, some high value items, usually drugs and a few thousand silver for possible trades, and ridable or pack animals to haul or travel on. Takes 12 guys 10 hours to load the supplies by which time they're all a bit peckish so one by one they all go to the kitchen and eat a meal, when they're all done somebody is a bit sleepy, so they take a nap, while the other 11 guys naval gaze waiting for the green light, the second thinks I might as well get a bit of sleep too. This often takes so long people get bored and stroppy and metal break risk, and blow me one of my guys has gone for wonder in a psychotic state, I guess the rest will just have to stand around for two days while they have a word with their self. Of course you can kick out the mental state colonist to resume to caravan forming but it just reduces the strength of the cavan. The caravan forming could be solved with the addition of one button 'send now', weather everything is loaded or not, sleeping or hungry, everybody heads for the exit with what ever is loaded, done. Whats more perplexing is people sleeping at 8 pm, at 10pm on the world map they sleep anyway, and they can also eat as soon as their hungry.\n\nI see a lot comments that the world map isn't used enough and I suspect this could be one of reasons why. I actually really like to raid on the map and if you want cool rare items as early as possible you have to go and get them, prisoners too seem to be easily obtainable from raiding and at 20 goodwill points an enemy base destroyed, half a dozen bases laters you got yourself 4 of 5 allies, I just hate getting on to the map in the first place. \n\nThat said no game is perfect, but this game is amazing with so many possibilities and additional content with the DLC's that I have barley even mentioned, try out the base game first, and a few hours in you will be hooked.            \n", "timestamp_created": 1668790310, "timestamp_updated": 1668790310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682787537574768066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124596784": {"recommendationid": "124596784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038370099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 656546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 513412, "last_played": 1679763729}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best colony sims i've ever played.

Grieving for my dying colonists, I notice Tara wake up. She was not bleeding out like her poor friends, just bruised. I send her to rescue her friends but on her way over she suffers a mental break. Adding insult to injury, she chooses to instead walk over to them in her delirium and hurl insults at them while they bleed all over the ground.

So the price in net total is still increased after the sale. \n\nIts manipulative, he saw people complaining about the price and lowered it by an insignificant amount just so he could say that he lowered the price in attempt to invalidate criticism, this is the equivalent of a billionaire donating 1000 dollars to charity just so they can call themselves charitable.\n\nHe also seems to think that just because the US is a rich country, that it means all citizens within the US are rich, and because of that, he shafts specifically the US with the prices. We aren't that rich, all of our wealth is stuck at the top 1% of people.

While the DLCs are nice, they aren't 25 dollars nice. That's almost the price of the base game. DLCs should be 10 dollars max when they don't completely overhaul the game. I bought Ideology and Royalty, so trust me when I say they aren't worth the pricetags. Royalty adds a slight bit to the game but besides the powers, the added ending, and more missions it doesn't add much, so maybe put it at a 8 dollar pricetag. For Ideology it adds a bit more, adds more structure, more incidents, I'd say a 12 dollar pricetag at most. As for biotech I looked over it all, and honestly looks like mods already on workshop just ripped off and added to the base game, but for 25 dollars. \n\nIt feels like Tynan is trying to milk the people who currently play Rimworld, instead of trying to advertise/get his game out to a wider audience. This is behavior I expect from a AAA corporation run by psychopaths, not indie game devs. I really hope this backfires on him and the following this game has leaves, letting his business go into the ground. The prices are insulting. \n\n\nThe game was fully backed on kickstarter, and then sold over a million copies when it was released in 2018. One million. If it was priced at 35 dollars which is its current price, that is 35 million dollars. Even after tax (let's say 20 million, or even 14 million), that's enough money to retire early and have 3 kids and still not be in debt. That would be well off. Even hiring someone in 2018, paying them 200k a year, that's 800k. \n\nThe price is unreasonable for a 25 dollar DLC when you have so much money left over. Even if 1 million people bought the DLC for 8 dollars, that's 8 million, maybe 2 million less after taxes. Paying the salary of that 1 employee for a few years a few times over.\n\n\nIf your comment on the review is overly sarcastic or not constructive it is getting deleted. If you disagree, you can say without being rude. Tell me why you think the price is justified besides 'they set the price'. Insulting me won't get me to take it down.

Managing job priorities and zones for stockpiles, farming, etc is a pain, because you are always changing their settings.

Maybe these shortcomings were understandable when the game was cheaper, but with the current ridiculous price tag, you would think these basic QOL issues would've been addressed.", "timestamp_created": 1668941070, "timestamp_updated": 1668941070, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61817324161529541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137602283": {"recommendationid": "137602283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370627231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7054, "last_played": 1692612885}, "language": "english", "review": "I am truly a terrible person", "timestamp_created": 1682927156, "timestamp_updated": 1682927156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616313397884368896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135495671": {"recommendationid": "135495671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225789260", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3988, "last_played": 1681091743}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting stay away", "timestamp_created": 1679854340, "timestamp_updated": 1679854340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615943491458892822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124574985": {"recommendationid": "124574985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370047027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1670096732}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 38 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

at the time of the release i think it was 18 euros, which i felt was a little overpriced, since the base game were 20 euros, but it was 25 now... what i want to clear out here, is that i loved royalty as well the coming dlcs. but i felt at that point it was on a runway straight to the top, and rightfully so. because it is a good game, and was still worth those 25 euros. but 45 euros at that point, started to be expensive. if i were going to buy it for my brother. tho i just hold tight, to it came on offer. but it never came better than 20%... i think here is where i started to kinda wonder if this is the right road for a game like this. because sure here is mods, and you can play the game with some mods. but not a full packet without the other dlcs. and so came Religion dlc. another Dlc i was excited for, and we can talk about that, it came out for 20 euros as well, which is fine for a Dlc like that. it added a whole butt ton. like 2 new endings, a completely new mechanic that game changed the game to suddenly be more inventive, i loved how creative you could be with it. like making your own religion by that adding another survival aspect of it. i struggled really hard with Ranchers. but that is the gift of it, new roles for colonists also made it more tactical, by you choosing tamers, that has a bigger chance of taming a pet. this Dlc was better than Royalty, since it added a lot more. you now have more creation to do. and that was great. 20 euros i would gladly pay for it. but now we in a danger zone. which again i will point out. this is starting to be really expensive. almost 60 euros to enjoy a good game like this. by that i feel you started to betray fan base. again ive been a supporter since early release, but at that point. i thought this is about to break down, your gonna get less players, and less fans. who would love this game. by that also hitting where it hurts on people, their money. i still haven't bought this game for my brother. and now probably never gonna buy it for him. since the price is hitting a boundary where no normal player would have the money for it, other than if they start saving money up for it. when i heard that a new dlc would be created, biotech's. i was troubled, because i'm sure its a good Dlc i just haven't had the money to buy it and try it, and sadly i don't think i will. 23 euros is expensive, and ofc if i saved some money up for it, i could hit the game again. and enjoy it. but that doesn't change that your price on the game and dlcs are rocking up at 91,5 euros... this is by far to expensive. and here is where i finally decided to open up my voice. i fear that you are basically trying to milk its last days. because you ain't getting any new followers, or buyers of this game. i say that because when my brother finally soo how much the base game costed now, he said. don't buy it, its not worth it...\n\nthis was the final straw for me, a huge fan since early release. big fan of what you made. of what you created. but now finally opening my eyes towards what this is about to become. what the future holds for the game i loved Rimworld...", "timestamp_created": 1676677795, "timestamp_updated": 1676677795, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60782158374786377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126026932": {"recommendationid": "126026932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142418310", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_at_review": 8154, "last_played": 1696463727}, "language": "english", "review": "So basically you enter a world where you turn into drug mafia and do war crimes just to have your colonists try to set your settlement on fire and destroy it cause he/she ate without table \n420/10 Best Game", "timestamp_created": 1669148882, "timestamp_updated": 1669148882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607406020164489746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143411407": {"recommendationid": "143411407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154420666", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 9412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9412, "last_played": 1686103872}, "language": "english", "review": "Rim world is one of those games that can pull you in and not let you go.

It's insanely addictive, fun, has a great lore, and the amount of liberty you have to develop your colony offers you great narratives. The events also keep you tense to the point you start to prepare your colony and make plans for any situation, even though most of the time they can be unexpected.\n\nThe modding community also keeps the game alive and beating, while in other modding scenes a mod author just refuses to let someone else to update it, effectively killing it forever (I see you, ETS2/ATS community), in RimWorld's case it seems like common sense to keep them going strong, with the author who's no longer willing to keep a mod up to date often granting the chance of another group to fork it to a new version as long as given credit, saving player's saves from incompatibilities.\n\nI've had plenty of good times with this game and for this reason I was happy to support it, and for that the staff and the modding community have my thanks.\n\nEverything has a negative side, however, which is the constant \"cult\" status towards the developer. Every decision and every word from the dev is righteous, and must be defended at all costs. It's pretty embarrassing to watch, specially in subreddits. \n\nThe pricing is also scandalous, with the complete aversion to sales hurting any interested players not living a cushy life in North America or Europe. God forbid someone from Latin America complain about dropping half their monthly salary into a game that will never see any sales other than an extremely rare 10% discount, specially when said game raised all its prices for the miserable parts of the planet during a global recession, with the DLCs being almost the same price as the base game. Easy to talk shit about \"beggars\" when you earn more in a day than most do in a month. Ironically, even though I threw a shade on the modding community for SCS Software, the devs themselves seem more considerate towards their fanbase than Ludeon Studios have ever seemed to be, which paid them off on the long run.\n\nSo, if you have the means, buy the game and its DLCs (who knows how many there will be, right? Sure hope there won't be some Paradox Interactive practices going forward). They are worth your time, and you'll likely be glad. If you're waiting for a sale for this, however, just do yourself a favor and keep it out of your wishlist: it won't happen and even if it does, it will be such a pathetic discount you might as well be paying full price already. Games are expensive, but there's a reason why RimWorld seems to have more pricing complaints than other titles.\n\nEdit: Ironically, as of February 18, 2023, a further price drop is announced...

We use regional pricing to try to make the game available to everyone worldwide.\n\nWe have not followed Steam's official recommended regional pricing practices - we have set the price lower than Steam's recommendations in nearly every case.\n\nYou can see the list of prices at this page below on SteamDB. Lookin the rightmost column to see the discount we've given compared to Valve's recommended price:\n\n https://steamdb.info/sub/41602/\n\nYou mentioned Latin America. As you can see, all Latin American countries get discounts (up to 65%) from the base price. And all of those discounts except Costa Rica are deeper than what Steam recommends. For example, the Argentinian price is 65% lower than USD, and 13% lower than Steam's recommendations. The Colombian price is 62% lower than USD, and 20% lower than Steam's recommendations.\n\nI'm hoping you and anyone reading will consider these facts in deciding whether we're doing wrong on pricing.

The TLDR is I have some complaints but even on days the game hates me, I stick around for the excellent modding community. The DLC is good enough I caved and got it even though I'm usually frugal. There are war crimes here; rimworlds do not have a geneva to host conventions in I guess.\n\n\nWhile I have some complaints, at 1600 hours in I can safely call this game compelling. Rimworld poses itself as a story generator moreso than a game, and by and large this works. Losing one of your colonists (or 'pawns') hurts in a mechanical and sometimes emotional capacity. The variable difficulty works well, especially with custom settings. Quests let you ratchet up the difficulty more, if you want.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n-extremely customizable colonists. they have innate qualities and things they like to do, but these are strong suggestions moreso than hard limits. \n-immense capacity for depth. in vanilla alone, you can make cyborg super-soldiers with high-power combat stimulants. with DLC, that soldier can be a vampire catgirl cultist with royal titles. either way, that colonist can have enemies and lovers and distant relations. \n-variability in playstyles. single colonist runs are viable, increasingly more so with the DLCs. clone-spawned army? cybernetics cult? tree-worshipping nudist mages? all possible, easily, if you grab the addons.\n-the modding community is stellar. Especially the few mod maintainers running around. Sincere kudos to you all.\n-colonists *can* be ressurrected, but chances are rare and their body has to be preserved at cryogenic temperatures. that means protecting both a tomb and its refrigeration unit during enemy waves, if you want them back. Adds a lot of tension to some fights.\n\nTHE CONS\n-so much cool stuff is DLC. I don't begrudge the devs that but if you're on a budget, definitely be aware.\n-The War Crimes Thing (see below)\n-performance gets worse as the game goes on. I have a suite of mods to remedy this. Some of it is my fault, I also have a suite of mods to use up as much performance as I gain back from the first batch.\n-there is (or at least used to be?) some reductive and unnessesary things in the backend, particularly in how pawns form relationships and stuff like that. things like men primarily flirting with women instead of a roughly even distribution. As with most things, there's a mod for that.\n-the mildest personal gripe: in the colonist name RNG table there's someone named 'poopy' and i devmode smite them every time they spawn. I'm sure theres a way to change the names list but i always forget to look. (this and bugtesting/bugfixing are the only reasons i leave dev mode accessible).\n-some events are annoying and, in my opinion, don't add as much as they remove. both the [ZZZT] and [Solar Flare] events mess with the player's power grid, and the latter stops any electrical devices from working at all. End result, a colonist you were preserving for later revival can decay too far and fully die before you even have a chance at an item to revive them. This adds frustration instead of tension, imo. Mild complaint though, since events can be disabled individually on world generation.\n\nTHE WAR CRIMES THING\n This game lets you do a lot of unethical shit. None of it is required, most of it is entirely avoidable. However, the mechanical rewards for being ethical are minimal and the punishments vary. However, giving your colonists cocaine to counteract the mood debuff of organ harvesting is a valid strategy and that bears mentioning. From a purely mechanical standpoint, there are a lot of benefits to being a terrible person to these digital beings.\n\nBenefits that I personally avoid reaping. For the most part. I admit, dog-murderers have been sent home from my colonies with peg legs and one lung shorter of breath.\n\nAnd that's the good and the bad of this game in a nutshell. It's compelling. It makes you care. And, with so many options available to ruin fictional lives, it's easy to be tempted. Much like being a full author, I'm told. So, I suppose rimworld is a success then.

As a colony sim junkie and massive fan of video games that give me the opportunity to be creative and larp, it sounded perfect for me. Based on the description and the reviews-- especially the average number of hours players had-- it seemed like it delivered on its promises to be a highly varied, fresh, creative, and randomized experience every time.\n\nMy first 50 hours were great. I was totally captivated by my first game once I got a hang of the mechanics. I liked it so much, in fact, that I literally bought a second copy the same week. I got bored of my first colony, felt like I could do something better on a Randy Random, commitment mode, higher difficulty world, so I tried it. Worked out great, so I then made a third colony with the naked brutality start.\n\nWhat I started to realize at this point was that as much as the game likes to pretend to be highly variable, fresh, fun, and random; characters constantly at the mercy of the storytelling AI as well as their own humanity, disasters, peculiar events-- basically, all those promises were pretty superficial. Every time I made a colony, I felt like it was the same story all over again.\n\nRimworld claims to be a story generator, but it really only generates the same story over and over. After three colonies, there's no more fun to be had with vanilla Rimworld without expansions. Though the characters have their silly little traits and partake in their own quirky behaviors, and maybe I'll be attacked by something that the RNG makes a little funny by complete chance, it's just so superficial and repetitive. No matter how many variables I try to play with in the settings, or whatever start I go with, whatever map I go with, I always end up with the same story revolving around even more lackluster and disappointing tower defense.\n\nMany of you might not relate to what I've said at all, and I bet that's because the vast majority of RimWorld players use mods. Sure, if the content gets stale, I should just mod, right?\n\nHere's where I have my major issue with Rimworld: it's a fucking $34.99 story generator that runs out of ideas after three playthroughs and from then on relies on mods to have any replayable value. I have absolutely no issue with small studios and independent game developers earning their fair share for their hard work-- on the contrary, this is actually super important to me. But I start to have a bit of a problem with this when the team behind Rimworld doesn't deliver.\n\nThe game has some issues that people have been complaining about for a while now: the wealth system being irritatingly illogical, certain quality of life features being completely nonexistent, colonist priorities being misevaluated, a lack of content diversity, etc. Have any of these been fixed on vanilla Rimworld? I don't think so, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. \"There are mods to fix that\"-- Yeah, I'm fully aware, but people are paying Ludeon $34.99 for Rimworld and receiving absolutely no updates to the base game, not even quality of life fixes that are so represented in the most downloaded mods. No, instead, we get offered DLC that costs half the price of the entire game.\n\nAgain, I respect artists and game developers-- but charging literally half the price of an already pricey base game (that never goes on sale) for content that makes the base game more likely to fulfill the promise it made players isn't cool. Honestly, Biotech was my breaking point. Babies have absolutely fucking nothing to do with anything in the rest of the DLC, but instead of adding them as an update to the base game, they were still lumped into the paid package because Ludeon is so opposed to improving and updating the base game without being paid.\n\nTake a look at Terraria, for instance: it's a third of the price of Rimworld and the developers not only continuously make minor improvements to the game, but in the past two or three years have released not one, but two HUGE updates that were literally game changing and added so much extra content to the game. Not only this, but these updates were done with the community in mind, with the developers reaching out to players to ask them what they wanted to see in the game.\n\nConcerned Ape, the guy who made Stardew Valley, released a huge, completely free update with long-time players in mind all while he was working on his newer game. He could've easily charged for this content as DLC, and that would've been totally fine, but it was added as an update with older players in mind in order to reward them for playing the game so long and give them a chance to achieve perfection.\n\nI'm not saying that all small developers need to add huge updates for free, but what I'm trying to point out is the difference between these developers and Ludeon, which follows a model similar to Paradox: have a boring base game and charge for DLC to make it a little less boring. With Ludeon's business model, it's against their interest to add to the base game, as that takes away from paid content they could add as DLC. I don't feel like I can continue to support a studio that operates on this model.\n\nI feel so out of place seeing everyone's reactions to the new DLC. I'm sure many people find it completely acceptable to charge this much for DLC, and to even charge $35 for the base game despite the fact that it never gets updated and has many flaws that could easily be fixed, but I don't find it acceptable anymore. And I don't find it acceptable to charge so much for a game that needs so many mods to be interesting after a certain point. I feel as though this will only get worse as time goes on, and that it isn't a productive strategy for Ludeon in the long run (unless you fucking troglodytes keep buying $25 DLC).", "timestamp_created": 1666134410, "timestamp_updated": 1666134410, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573432803153991699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134675766": {"recommendationid": "134675766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013863866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14405, "last_played": 1689779719}, "language": "english", "review": "I would summarize Rimworld as somewhat of a flawed gem with a longevity that depends on your ability to maintain suspension of disbelief. \n\nThe premise is quite appealing, at least to me, as is the early gameplay. Frantically deal with the elements, setting up an early camp, dealing with an opportunistic early raid by 3-4 bandits... That part is quite immersive. As is planning out a more extensive base, setting up schedules for your colonists, adding defenses, etc. Having to deal with the pawn psychology is an interesting concept and it does make for some interesting stories, so it's not hard to see why the game is considered a story generator. It does start to get silly when a colonist snaps and wants to hide from the world in her room... but only after first getting her favourite snack of insect jelly, which right at that moment only exist in a room with an active infestation of megaspiders the rest of the colony is dealing with by torching it. Never mind there's two lines of heavily armed soldiers preventing murder bugs on fire from trying to escape the inferno, Cella wants her jelly and pushes her way past them, munches some jelly, then runs around on fire before expiring.\n\nStories like the above will abound, but for me they quickly turn into a story of bad AI and entirely unrealistic behaviour.\n\nUnfortunately, once the latter part of the game comes around the stories start becoming borderline insane and not at all endearing. While I can understand the AI of the enemies trying to storm the base is not the best, the way the game is set up to try and provide a challenge is by essentially throwing more mobs at you and all reason out the window. As a specific example, in my last game my mountain base with a roughly 10 m thick wall of bedrock at the thinnest point gets attacked by Neanderthals wielding clubs, knives and spears (literally). The game warns me they'll try to circumvent my defenses. Which these Neanderthals are apparently able to do. Not only do they magically know where this thinnest spot is, they wait around while a single member in their gang spends an in-game hour (a relatively short amount of time, less than a minute) to stab his way through 10 m of bedrock using his spear. Which magically doesn't break.\n\nDo not expect basic understanding of physics to be applicable in this game. There are other enemies that can melt their way through bedrock, such as mechanoid thermites (think burrowing robots with cannons); while fantastical I can understand them being a threat, and it's sci-fi so suspension of disbelief is preserved, but Neanderthals with spears ...?\n\nOn the plus side, there is a very active modding community so you'll be able to adjust the game to match the way you wish to play.

I wouldn't recommend this game at all if not wide variety of really awesome mods that add a whole lot of content as well as offer plenty of simple, not game-breaking, quality of life tweaks, as well as performance boosters.\n\nThe base game (without mods) is like paying for game's demo, with very little to actually do. Maybe call my imagination limited, but to me there's just not enough here to justify 30+ USD pricetag, (~150 of my currency, which is more than 10% minimal wage).\nWithout the DLCs (at least Ideology and Biotech) mods are an absolute must, at least to me, and by putting pricetag this high it feels like creator is literally asking you to pay this much for game's engine + mod access.\n\nI feel like 30$/150 would be reasonable for current \"base game\" +Ideology +Biotech, maybe 35-40$, while it's actually [b] twice [/b] that price, a price of a triple A tittle (which year or two post release tend to get a massive discounts, like 50%. Often 60-75% off after 3 years+). Here? Discounts are practically nonexistant, at least in my country. The highest discount I saw in 4 years period was 10%. Only this Christmas, for the first time I believe, there was 20%, and it was for \"base game only\". which actually had its base price increased over time.\n\nCall me stingy with my money, but to me as well to at least 4 other people I know, share the same exact opinion. I'm not the first one who sees this price as way too high. Not to mention I saw plenty posts online where many people say that they see it as very, very expensive.\n\nPS: And to those that say \"It's worth the money\", \"It's not a problem\", tell me, did you bought it, or did your parents did? Because if it's the second, you can't say it's not expensive if its not you who paid for it, and If the first, how much are your earnings? I can guarantee, just because it may not a problem for [b]you[/b] specifically or someone in your family, that doesn't change the fact that many, many other people around the world have worse financial situation. And yes, it doesn't mean that every product should be \"made affordable for them\", but a single game, game that doesn't have a whole lot in terms of graphics or music, and wasn't made by some famous mark, shouldn't cost them a sizable chunk of their monthly income to play it.\n\nOh also, do you use mods, or is \"100% vanilla\" perfectly fine to you? Because if you use any mods, that means you aren't quite happy with the product, you would like more out of what it is, and that \"something more\" isn't - or at least shouldn't - be a part of the price. Just sayin.\n\nHate me if you like, I stand by my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1672351137, "timestamp_updated": 1672351137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559089839458465576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145571878": {"recommendationid": "145571878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396614833", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 46296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44960, "last_played": 1695272258}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1693719921, "timestamp_updated": 1693719921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555686116218566895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137796807": {"recommendationid": "137796807", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966623117", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 141937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1786, "playtime_at_review": 131588, "last_played": 1695751331}, "language": "english", "review": "\"\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude59, \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude59, \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude60 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69.\"", "timestamp_created": 1683232594, "timestamp_updated": 1683232594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554474890232086182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126691751": {"recommendationid": "126691751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291054157", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2961, "last_played": 1687946586}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Colony Status[/i]: [u][b]Destroyed[/b][/u]\n[i]Reason[/i]: [u][b]the colonist was in a bad mood[/b][/u]\n\n[strike]oh, okay.[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1669321448, "timestamp_updated": 1669321448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55435788631439209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137196745": {"recommendationid": "137196745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219568949", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 36252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33705, "last_played": 1683127988}, "language": "english", "review": "Many warcrimes\nMany Geneva Convention violations\nMany questionable practices in general\nMany fun times were had by everyone except the other inhabitants on the rim", "timestamp_created": 1682284467, "timestamp_updated": 1682284467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552453279495239258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124286492": {"recommendationid": "124286492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045215802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 36583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32850, "last_played": 1683085187}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game, and every dlc adds so much greatness to the game. best simulator i've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1666547576, "timestamp_updated": 1666547576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552238762378692627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132957168": {"recommendationid": "132957168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041505881", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1668360537}, "language": "english", "review": "As you can see looking at other reviews -

So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, watched a tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he modded a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Set in a sci-fi world, the game challenges you to command a group of stranded survivors on a distant planet and build a thriving colony while overcoming numerous obstacles along the way.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of RimWorld is its dynamic and complex AI-driven storytelling. Each colonist has a unique personality with traits, abilities, and backstories that shape their behavior and interactions with others. This makes for a compelling and often unpredictable narrative that unfolds as you play. The game beautifully interweaves the events, crises, and stories of the individual characters to make you feel emotionally connected to the colonists and connected to their survival.\n\nThe game mechanics of RimWorld are deep and diverse. You must manage resources, construct buildings, grow crops, research technologies, and defend your colony against various threats such as hostile wildlife, bandits, and even raiders. The level of control and customization is excellent, allowing you to customize your experience through mod support and a wide range of game settings.\n\nThe game`s visuals may appear simplistic at first glance, but they effectively convey the atmosphere and convey the game's underlying depth. The pixel art style adds charm and allows smooth performance even on less powerful systems. The sound design and music complement the gameplay beautifully, increasing the immersion and enhancing the overall enjoyment.\n\nRimWorld offers incredible depth and replayability, but can be very difficult for beginners. For those unfamiliar with similar simulation and strategy titles, the learning curve is steep and the game's complexity can be overwhelming. Additionally, some players may find the micro-management required to maintain a successful colony tedious or frustrating, especially in times of emergency or crisis. Overall, RimWorld is a masterpiece game that combines strategy, simulation, and storytelling into a truly unique experience. A dynamic AI-driven narrative, deep game mechanics, and endless possibilities make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Despite a difficult learning curve and occasional micromanagement frustration, RimWorld rewards your patience with countless hours of engaging and addictive gameplay.\u00a0\n\nBuy it.", "timestamp_created": 1689104629, "timestamp_updated": 1689104629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141838077": {"recommendationid": "141838077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212033256", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 6263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4187, "last_played": 1690125940}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best game ever made i bought this long ago and I just realize i haven't comment on this so here i am so i don't have much thing to say about this game it just so so good if you don't think it good you can take a look it over a million copies had sold so what are you waiting for go get it and it will take all of your time to spend in this game and you can't get away from it even you get bore you will come back and stuck with it again so 10/10 best game ever ! thank you to the dev team for this amazing game ! <3", "timestamp_created": 1689088095, "timestamp_updated": 1689088095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141109913": {"recommendationid": "141109913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240178310", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1858, "last_played": 1693370153}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my first ever game base building colony sim and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how well designed this game is.

The base building feels satisfying, the game feels alive, and most importantly it feels like there is always something going on. I do however have to say that if you do not have a veteran friend like I did you will most definitely struggle or have to watch hours upon hours of tutorial videos and how to play videos. Luckily my friend taught me the basics and I was able to figure out the rest, but if you don't have this your going to have one hell of a time. So for that reason I am damn near sure if I did not have that friend I would be giving this game a not recommend. So if your ready to sit down and learn entirely new systems and game functions and put in a lot of hours that you could lose in about five minutes you'll most definitely enjoy this game.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki \"Yagoo\" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "timestamp_created": 1682969287, "timestamp_updated": 1683848600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137487629": {"recommendationid": "137487629", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067657210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2756, "last_played": 1692011018}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE HARVESTING ORGANS!!!! \n\n\nhuman leather cowboy hats <3333", "timestamp_created": 1682780428, "timestamp_updated": 1682780428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135505861": {"recommendationid": "135505861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000118437", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18081, "last_played": 1685593503}, "language": "english", "review": "Build.

When I read \"driven by an intelligent AI storyteller\", got a recommendation from an acquaintance and saw so many positive reviews I had to try it. I thought the price is a bit steep but if it can deliver what it promises it's totally worth it. So I got the game and played several hours thinking \"This is a nice base builder but I wonder when I get to experience story...\". I really tried to get into the game and continued playing. After a while it started to get quite frustrating to continue. I don't see it delivering what it promises. It gets very repetitive with a lot of micromanagement and no story.\n\nI now have over 40h of playtime and my 3rd colony. All quests I've seen are either \"attack this base\", \"rescue someone from bad guys\", \"deliver x amount of y\" or something inbetween. All the story generator seems to do is randomly select attacks, quests and things happening to colonists from a limited pool of scenarios. They have no influence on future events and nothing changes.

I began the playthrough planting crops, building rooms and mining into a mountain.  It was nicely designed I thought, but still pretty basic. I was hours in and hadnt even began thinking about electricity or research. One of my colonists, a highly skilled gardener incapable of violence, had gone out from my rudimentary base to harvest some berries. Along the way they got attacked by an enraged squirrel and quickly succumbed to its furious savaging and now laid on the floor bleeding out.\n\nI sent my rifleman out to kill the squirrel, and whilst the maddened beast was distracted, I sent my medic / miner to go rescue my gardener. Unfortunately the squirrel knocked out my rifleman, and followed my medic and gardener back to the base, smashing through the door and attacking them as they lay in bed. It was brutal.\n\nThe room covered in blood, I thought it all game over, but then something amazing happened! A mysterious stranger appeared on the map who sensed danger, and joined my cult I mean colony. With a massive skill in guns, it was time to deal with the man-eating squirrel once and for all. I sent him quickly to the base, he drew his weapon and was just aiming to shot when the furry ball of death rushed him and tore him apart. I now had 4 colonist lying in a pool of blood dying.\n\nI hoped maybe something else would come to my aid so I waited. Also immediately a raid from The Killer Robbers began. The robbing killer made his way to my base, set fire to it, murdered my cat, and then left. Didnt actually rob anything though, so I consider myself lucky.

Not just because of the game play, which I absolutely enjoy, but because the devs had enough foresight to not only make an amazing game, but to include and encourage mods.\n\nDo you like strategy/building/upgrading/total imagination with birds eye view games, while totally deciding if you want world peace or create a massive army to take over the entire world? This may be for you.\n\nFarming? Check. Crafting? Check. Base defense? Check. Exploring? Check. Raising animals for possible consumption? Check. Leveling your pawns? Check. Raiding neighboring towns/villages/bandits? Check. Cannibalism? Check. I could go on.\n\nThe ability to adjust the game to your playstyle is absolutely second to none. In my 35+ years of gaming, this Rimworld adjustment of difficulty is legit. And I mean truly adjust. Not that bland garbage where everything but absolute max difficulty is about the same. Where max difficulty is lazy coding, like certain FPS games when you shoot one bot, every other bot within 1 KM finds you and turns you into Swiss cheese.\n\nThe vanilla game is downright awesome. Amazing even. You want a relaxing paced game? You got it. You want it to be more challenging? Boom, settings. You want to play a game that stresses you out, thus having nightmares because you thought you were tough enough to defy the devs when they can play god and absolutely wreck everything you built and dared to dream about? Here you go. They tried to warn you.\n\nDid they release new updates that break all your mods? No big deal. Go to the game\u2019s properties and then betas and roll that Bisquick back. They allow you to roll back the version to allow you to enjoy the mods from a previous iteration!!!!! If that isn't love for the players, I don\u2019t know what is!

Didn't touch it for several years. Couldn't even imagine how much life, beauty and depth is hidden underneath it's simplistic looks. When I finally decided to give it a try and forced myself to spend at least 7-10 hours learning the basics, I was sucked in almost immediately. It's not just an extremely entertaining, intricate and deep colony management game. It is a simulation of life, characters, appearances, relationships, drama, health, war, friendships, climate, weather, flora, fauna and so on (Ideology and Biotech deliver even more). And it's all connected, it all makes sense and every aspect of the game influences your playthrough in one way or another. There is so much in this game, that it's hard to describe to friends when I try to pitch RimWorld to them. \n\nI have a problem of getting tired with games after a couple of weeks of playing. But I just can't get enough of RimWorld, it's super addictive and exceptionally entertaining, although sometimes the micromanagement can get a bit tiresome. Of course, it has it's flaws, it's not perfect. You will notice a few annoyances and lack of some functionality along the way. But it won't be game breaking. If you like management/simulation/strategy games, have some time to invest in it and want a great story with characters that you will grow attached to very quickly -- then grab it. It's worth it. It's just that type of game that you think about when falling asleep at night and might remember for years to come. Read other reviews. It's not \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" for nothing, after all. Buy this thing and get immersed into the story of great triumph and miserable failure and just let things happen.\n\nP.S. And don't even get me started on modding...

The answer is YES!  This game is one of the best games I have ever played. It has a bit of everything. Management, strategy, tactics and of course story generation. It can be a difficult and frustrating game at times, but that is a part of the game. \n\nThe game is great, because it can be adjusted to your own experience. Are you only interested in creating a cool looking base or are you interested in seeing what it is like to play a wild cannibal tribe? Anything is possible. With all the mods available to this game the only limit is your fantasy. You can also customize how you start the game and your starting characters, and exactly how difficult you want the game to be. I recommend playing it on a difficulty that will challenge you and part of the fun is that sacrifices will have to be made (and I did not mean ritual sacrifices of people although you can do that too). It's not great to see the pawn who built almost everything in your base die, but it does not end the game. Chances are that you find someone else who can rise up to the occasion. \n\nThe game has a lot of depth when it comes to strategy and management. For example you may have the opportunity to get a new colonist with great skills, but you discover that he has the pyromaniac trait. If you live in a colony made out of wood or in a forest it might be too much of a risk to take, however, if you have researched fire foam poppers or have colonists who can spew out fire foam to extinguish fires quickly then perhaps it can be managable. \n\nA very important part of the game is to handle the mood of your colonists and to make sure that they don't break down. Poor mood can easily lead to the downfall of your colony as the colonists will have multiple breakdowns and not do what they are assigned to. Sometimes they even go on sprees to destroy something and this can really set you back if they destroy something expensive and valuable like that hi-tech research bench you needed to research that piece of armor you want. \n\nCombat in Rimworld is difficult. It takes a lot of micromanagement and correct positioning of your pawns. Wounded colonists need to be hauled to your medbay and treated there, if the injuries are serious enough they might even need surgery. It starts off easy, but as you expand and increase the wealth of your colony the difficulty increase a lot. The initial raider with a club will be replaced with insect infestations, sieges and mech clusters (with the Royalty DLC). It requires planning and preparation to defeat them or you are guaranteed to fail. Even if you are prepared you will fail sometimes.

Don't get me wrong, it deserves the recognition it has, but I think there's a strong possibility it was one of thoe fluke successes like Valheim. It's a colony sim with a huge amount of depth, customisation and content - but not a brilliant UI. Thankfully the modding community has fixed / added almost anything you could think of, which fixes any potential issues I had, and adds a huge amount of quality of life changes. Mods also very much allow you to \"play it your way\" rather than adhering to strict difficulty settings, which makes it appeal to an even wider audience.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- Nice background music\n- Loads of content and events\n- Lots of difficulty settings\n- Mod support, with a large modding community\n- Useful settings for cooking meals like \"until you have 5\" rather than manually always adding recipes (like ONI)\n- Extremely granular rules, if you want, for all kinds of things. There are settings for work schedule, what food people are allowed to eat, what medicine they're allowed, where they can go, which animals are allowed where etc. This is awesome, but can also cause a lot of confusion; like trying to find out why my colonists wouldn't store herbal medicine anywhere. The storage allowed herbal medicine, but turned out it didn't allow \"fresh\" items.\n- You can also set policies for what kind of clothing people are allowed to wear (and set roles for people). It took me a LONG time to realise that. One of my colonists was permanently grumpy because he was wearing a tattered hat. Turns out you have to edit the clothing rules to only allow items with more than 50% hp remaining, otherwise he'll conitnue to complain and wear something that makes him unhappy.\n- You can domesticate animals and farm them for produce, meat, leather etc.\n- The game is an incredibly detailed simulation. There's so much to mention here. Colonists have individual body parts. The world and the rooms you build have temperature with themodynamics and insulation. There's a roofing mechanic. There are raids. Combat. Colonoists have relationships with each other and get depressed. They have personality quirks. You can capture raiders and take them prisoner, then sell them as slaves or recruit them. The list goes on.\n- Animals will breed. You can create an 'auto-slaughter' policy for animals so you can automatically keep your herd sizes down based on the animal growth stage and gender\n- When you create your game, you choose where in the world to start. This affects everything on the map you build your colony in, such as growing season, average temperature, land features (hills, mountains, river etc)\n- Everything you make from walls to furniture to clothes, can be made out of different materials. The clothes you make have different properties such as thermal insulation and protection depending on the material you make them out of.\n- Your colonists and animals generate dirt which needs to be cleaned. The cleanliness score of a room doesn't only affect happiness, but also things like medical procedure success chance\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\nDespite any and all of the below, I either found ways around them, learned what I needed to, or found a mod for it.\n\n- Ugly (but you get used to it). Subjective, but this was what put me off the game for years\n- Steel is a flammable material\n- No Steam achievements\n- The UI is really unintuitive. Even after playing for 4 hours I'm never sure where to look for things. There are lots of oddities that can be confusing until you Google them. For example, at one stage I could only make things out of steel instead of wood like I'd been doing so far. Turns out there's a tiny arrow next to the item menu that lets you change the material, and I'd run out of wood\n- Without a mod, there's no way to get the camera to follow a colonist to see what they do\n- It took me a good 10 hours to work out how to improve \"room score\" (it's a combination of wealth, size, decor, cleanliness)\nThe artwork for the colonists walking around your base does not include arms, hands, legs or feet. The system behind them is very intelligent, but the graphical representation means that you can think they're fine, then realise after a few hours that they're missing an arm and need a prosthetic\n- The modding community is huge, and that's good because the base game does some basic things really badly. The trade interface is confusing. Colonists will walk into their own traps. Colonists will use super medicine to treat a bruise. Colonists will collect fertilised eggs and eat them when you want to hatch them.\n- Rooms are auto-tagged based on what the game thinks they're for.

For example, there are mods to turn your colonists into Jedi or mods like \"Prepare Carefully\", which may be helpfui for the first few games you play, as you can put together your own colonists and pick what items they crash land with. \n\nIt's a ton of fun, and there are so many things that happen based on world events and the traits of your colonists. Treat them badly, and you may end with a colonist having a mental breakdown, digging out corpses, leaving them on the dinner table,l thereby lowering everyones mood. \n\nEventually, you grow used to your colonists and losing one of them due to a random catastrophy sucks. Fortunately, you can save at any point and go back a bit if necessary. \n\nHere are some things I learned later on, which can be quite helpful when you start out: \n- Not only can you assign your colonists to different duties via the work menu, you can switch to a manual mode there and set up priorities. So if you wanna make sure your chef focuses on cooking your much needed meals, change the priorities. \n- Regarding food - try to make sure to plant raw food early on. Build your kitchen close to the fields, and set up a stockpile room for raw and cooked food close to that kitchen. That way, you can speed up food production, which is essential. \n- You can also determine what is stored in what stockpile area. Once you can build AC units, set up a refrigerated food stockpile room very close to your kitchen. \n\nI also have started dabbling with the DLCs and will eventually review them. They aren't exactly cheap, but they do add quite a lot of content, like fun new game mechanics. \n\nNow that Dwarf Fortress has a steam release and a nicer looking, more inviting UI, I will spend some time with that game as well, as it's like one of the ancestors for games like Rimworld, but Rimworld itself will remain a favorite... it's fun and very addictive to set up a new colony and watch the weird curveballs the game throws you. \n\nDefinitely recommended, and if you find it confusing at first, there are great tutorials on YouTube and the aforementioned mod which may give you an easier start to get used to the game. \n\nHighly recommended... no two playthroughs are the same, and I still love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1673119931, "timestamp_updated": 1673119931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53298497200012207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135108607": {"recommendationid": "135108607", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042205104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 113317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107565, "last_played": 1694778834}, "language": "english", "review": "Idk if I'd recommend it, it's a little early to say", "timestamp_created": 1679415663, "timestamp_updated": 1679415663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532908737659454346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124159120": {"recommendationid": "124159120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040462005", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 893088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9173, "playtime_at_review": 686758, "last_played": 1696601765}, "language": "english", "review": "AFTER 11,000 HOURS ONE ONLY SEES HATS.", "timestamp_created": 1666358953, "timestamp_updated": 1666358953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532363414764404297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143348267": {"recommendationid": "143348267", "author": {"steamid": "76561199301522997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6097, "last_played": 1691121495}, "language": "english", "review": "in this game you can comit war crimes, you can mod the game so much you can make nukes,furries, 18+ stuff and much more", "timestamp_created": 1691095824, "timestamp_updated": 1691095824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532163739204406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137454431": {"recommendationid": "137454431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072708366", "num_games_owned": 1269, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 269842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251587, "last_played": 1691795586}, "language": "english", "review": "i cant stop wont stop", "timestamp_created": 1682732357, "timestamp_updated": 1682732357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532163739204406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130885903": {"recommendationid": "130885903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834454171", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1680726406}, "language": "english", "review": "world building is fun", "timestamp_created": 1673769159, "timestamp_updated": 1674099218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532163739204406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130553974": {"recommendationid": "130553974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981998265", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 26944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25431, "last_played": 1683185686}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah this game is just pure amazement.

it's a proc gen game so this must be a bug\". i captured her then i picked a colonist with high enough social skills to convert her, but when i tried to interact with her i didn't get the option. it took me a while but then it hit me, the message said [b]tame her[/b]. so i picked a colonist with animal taming skills and interacted with her. i literally tamed her, taught her some social manners and she became a valuable member of my colony.\n\nsufficed to say, the feeling i had when i sent my colonists to space was incredibly satisfying.\n\ni'll tell you another story. on my second playthrough i started with 3 colonists (because i'm quite new to this game and i don't have the capability to survive with a single cannibal character in an arctic region). this is my second playthrough afterall. i also added a horse named ping in my starting inventory because i thought it would make my life easier trading with nearby settlements. anyways, time goes on. more colonists join, my base expands. i get attacked by mad beavers, mechanoids and so on. during that time one of my initial colonists, jae forms a bond with ping.\n\non my third year i realize ping is 31 years old. i don't know how long horses live so i check it's information. turns out the average lifespan of a horse is 30 years. so i make a tough call. i'm gonna release ping to the wild so she can roam freely in her final days. i pick jae for this task, and i set ping free.\n\ncouple days later i wondered if she was still in my region so i started looking around the map and there she was, roaming around with a herd. but then.. then i checked her log messages. the message said \"jae reminisced about the good time she had with ping and set her free\".\n\nas someone who had to put down his 18 year old collie, that fucking message melted my heart. the simple fact that the guys at luden added this tiny detail puts this game in my top 10, easily. cyberpunk can't manage to have this level of personality and detail with it's fucking 70GB size. this 500MB game that runs on a potato can.\n\ni have a friend in my friends list who played this game for over 2000 hours (naber cem?) for a long time i wasn't able to make sense of it, mainly because i didn't know what this game was about but after watching hours of gameplay and then seeing it with my own eyes, i get it.", "timestamp_created": 1673817647, "timestamp_updated": 1673818104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531435370445251465", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147073589": {"recommendationid": "147073589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408337766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4102, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1696524512}, "language": "english", "review": "Teo told Kimmy that he wants to spend his life with her.

Only a fool would let everybody die before making sacrifices, we learned from this experience, and instead of focusing our efforts on researching new shiny tools of destruction, we focused on farming, and keeping the little food we had last as long as possible, eventually this lead to the creation of pemmican, followed by air conditioners, then we realized the reason we couldn\u2019t properly survive the cold months was not because we didn\u2019t have enough food, but because our hunters weren\u2019t equipped to survive the cold outdoors, so we invested our money into the purchasing of two muffalow, which we used to gather wool, both as an item for trade, and as a material for clothing and sandbags. Over the next couple years we realized that the cruel and vile actions we took to survive did not harm us, but helped us in the long run, the results taught us lessons that forced us to look at what we had, what we were to face, and then at how we could survive, we learned that sacrifice was a necessary process, and that even the greatest of warriors must fall in order for more to rise, it is not enough to simply throw a dozen weak sacks of flesh with small guns against hordes of stronger, more durable, and better equipped soldiers. We learned that each life in the colony meant the exact same as the other, we could never afford to keep our best, for if we did it ended up requiring the sacrifice of our adequate, but without the adequate our best fell quick, we learned that even though we may have worshiped some higher power before crashing upon this foreign world, that there is no god that dwells on the RimWorld, there is only death, blood, fear, and dismay, but even in the face of hardship we mustn\u2019t give up, when our allies are taken away from us by raiders we cannot let grief overtake us, if we do not learn and grow from our dead then their lives truly meant nothing, for the true death of a man is a death that is not cared about, it is not when they are forgotten, but when the lessons they taught us are ignored. Yet through the many colonies and allies I have made, and lost, along the way, there seems to always be one thing that stays perfectly consistent. Death is not a threat, it is a wager, you will never be fully guaranteed or denied death, things that should be impossible become reality on the RimWorld, as if everything was stuck upon the verge of insanity. There truly is no right way to survive, whether you be diplomatic, violent, be saints, or morally corrupt devils form the deepest and darkest pits of hell; because in the end, there is always a new beginning, the only thing that dictates your chances of survival are how ready you are to sacrifice, how many of your own you are willing to let die to secure the safety of the colony, and how many corpses you will pile up before you finally learn the lesson they all desperately tried to teach you.\nSo, can anybody really say that my actions have been immoral? Could a sane man be brought to insane plans and actions due to their own desperate want to survive? I think not, and even if they do, it will not change the fact that I did not regret a single action I took along my path to power, for the power I sought was not that to destroy, but that to protect..\nJK the whole thing is basically war crime simulator, go wild, have fun, light a man on fire, use chemical warfare, make child soldiers, and never forget; there are no Geneva conventions in space (:\n", "timestamp_created": 1683387601, "timestamp_updated": 1684975903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530773937702178955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137827201": {"recommendationid": "137827201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121804437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 55097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "playtime_at_review": 49125, "last_played": 1696104399}, "language": "english", "review": "The chicken I was watching for a quest was hit by a ship part that fell from space", "timestamp_created": 1683293582, "timestamp_updated": 1683293582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530773937702178955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125429630": {"recommendationid": "125429630", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996144935", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18271, "last_played": 1669036263}, "language": "english", "review": "I never do game reviews but I have to make an exception here.

Very very complex. The pawn AI's also are somewhat unreasonable in the level of tinkering and micro-managing with their schedules to make them do common sense things or priority work-- and it really does not need to be. The creator made the default priorities pretty good, the same thought should be extended to making sure that laying marble tile flooring is not be more important than building a security wall, heater, or refrigeration unit, for example. The direct controls when you draft the pawns also need work and polish, because range differences when trying to shoot a distant enemy will divide half or more of your part between firing or walking up to them.

These are the Mods i used and why i use em\n\na.) Smart Farming\n-Very helpful in fast changing season areas as well as Random Randy, also to lessen petty jobs for small sowed areas like Hay and Dandelion Animal Feed\nb.) Simple FX: Vapor\n-Helps me determine cold areas without having to click temperature UI\nc.) Character Editor\n-This is actually a Cheat, it allows me to make my own Pawn before the start or even during a story\nd.) Build from Inventory\n-Pawns will take resource from your animal or other pawns as priority but sometimes it's bugged and takes from the furthers resource instead\ne.) Smart Medicine\n-Pawns will use medicine from other pawns inventory as priority. very useful in 'treat right now' situations\nf.) Gear up and Go \n-As the name suggests, your pawns will try to rally and get their battle gear and go to their battle situations but seems useless in late-game scenarios\ng.) HugsLib\n-tbh i don't know it's use but someone told me to get this and put it on top of my Mod Lists to help with mods\nh.) Harmony\n-same as HugsLib also no idea what this does, i just took it as a precaution.\ni.) Replace Stuff\n-it overwries your built items so you dont have to reconstruct or uninstall them, saves a lot of time\nj.) RimHud\n-Replaces your Pawn HUD (lower left corner) with an easier HUD that gives you all info that you need about that pawn.\nk.) Wall Light\n-Allows you to place lights on walls, saves space and looks cool (only works on built walls, doesnt work on mountain walls)\n\nThat's it for now, will update if i find more cool mods, feel free to comment whatever Mods i can also use", "timestamp_created": 1669988363, "timestamp_updated": 1670136311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52705848217010498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141185730": {"recommendationid": "141185730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132234778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1690160109}, "language": "english", "review": "i bought this game after pirating it", "timestamp_created": 1688354322, "timestamp_updated": 1688354322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52702707052230835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141140849": {"recommendationid": "141140849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304056116", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 573, "last_played": 1694801312}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good fun.

Want to be a cannibalistic raiding faction? This is the DLC for you)\nDLC: Biotech: Amazing (The best DLC. Combines features from several mods to add in genetic engineering and other fun features.)\n\nRimworld is an exceptional games that combines the best of games like Dwarf Fortress, The Sims, Theme Hospital, and other colony management games. It is very similar to Prison Architect. Build a colony, research technology, take care of your colony members, expand, trade, and explore the map. Fight off raids, raid other factions, build alliances. Try to survive everything the game's Story Teller engine throws at you while you attempt to escape the planet or don't. You can forgo the quest and simply play until you get bored or get destroyed. The point of the game is the story. No matter how tragic or adventurous, you will remember how you got to the end far more than the ending itself. \n\nThe base game and the DLC not enough for you? The workshop is filled with tons of high quality mods made by talented modders such as Osktar and Bjorn. The Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha Animals, Dinosauria, Arachanphobia, Call of Cthulu, and dozens of faction mods ensure a very varied experience. Mod interaction is exceptional and the Vanilla Genetics Expanded interacts seamlessly with Bioltech's features and some of the animal mods to greatly expand your genetic engineering options.

just quickly preface this review with some gushing praise. Rimworld is the single most compelling colony sim I've ever played. I've had it for just over a month and have sunk an absurd amount of hours in, with no sign of slowing.\n\nIt's probably also the single best game recommendation I've ever received (thanks Jade)!\n\nI feel there's a lot to be said for emergent, semi-random-story-telling being the future of video games, it's certainly looking that way for me specifically.\n\nIt's shocking to me how effortlessly Rimworld acts as a playground for creating the ideal narrative for the player. I've struggled with difficulty for decades in games, and I think Rimworld has my absolute favourite approach to date.\n\nThat also extends to thematic and even cosmetic customisation, it's absolutely wild how modular this game becomes when you utilise the steam workshop.\n\nI'm just gonna quickly write out the two random events that happened in my current colony that just instantly locked in this game as my favourite of the year. The two of them are definitely in my top narrative gaming moments of all time:\n\n1. A mere week into my newly formed colony (solo mechanitor start, extreme desert, don't ask). A wanderer shows up and requests to join. She's an absolute meme. The Rimworld community widely considers the trait \"Pyromaniac\" to among the worst traits for your colonists to possess. I let her stay for 3 reasons. Firstly, I needed the manpower, solo mechanitor is a strong start, but you can easily get taken out, particularly if you get sick. Secondly, I was in the desert. Pyromaniac is still bad there, but it's not like she was gonna be able to burn down my entire map, it was all basically just sand with the occasional rock. Lastly, and most importantly, she shared my actual name, Alex, as well as being asthmatic, which I coincidentally am.\n\nSo I gave her a chance, because she was LITERALLY ME.\n\nOver the course of that first year she quickly became one of my best and most reliable colonists. She had a tribal background which made it very easy for her to become a psychic wizard. Her occasional uncontrollable fire starting sprees were annoying, but her timing tended to be pretty manageable. \n\nOne normal day on the rim, we were getting raided as normal by a bunch of weed hippies. She'd been whinging about the tainted flak jacket that I'd been forcing her to wear, but the raids were still extremely manageable given the technological gulf between our colony and the savage weed imp tribe.\n\nSo I let her leave the flak jacket at home.\n\nBefore the battle, she had one last conversation with one of my other colonists. I have a screenshot of it.\n\n\"Alex and Ivy exchanged thoughts about life's many regrets\".\n\nForeboding. Randy Random, it seems, has a tragically cruel sense of irony.\n\nWe did away with the tribals with practised efficiency, that's probably giving the squad too much credit, semi-autos and killer robots vs spears and bows is hardly fair, even if it's 4-1 numbers-wise. If anything it had become a little bit routine, hence my hubris.\n\nIn the same moment that the tribals had suffered enough casualties to decide that our potatoes weren't worth the hassle, one of their rangers made a final, desperate toss with his pilum. Having now recreated the exact setup after the fact, I know that he had less than a 5-10% chance to land a hit. Given that it was night, it was at the absolute max range of the pilum, and Alex was in decent cover.\n\nI like to imagine it went down like this:\n\nThe familiar cacophony of Alex's chain shotgun barks out in defiant fury. Two of the three resulting walls of buckshot introduce themselves unceremoniously to the charging impid. He crumples like a marionette with its strings cut, dead before he hits the floor.\n\n\"Ivy, my friend...\" Alex spares a glance over he shoulder to the priest guarding her back, charging a fresh magazine. \"...I fear I've grown too good at this..\" she finishes with a grimace.\n\n\"Look!\" Ivy responds, \"they've thought better of it, they're running!\"\n\n\"About t-\"\n\nNeither Alex sees it coming.\n\nThere one moment, gone the next. The Alex that remains (that's me biiiitch) cries out in disbelief.\n\nI don't remember what happened next specifically. Obviously I wanted retribution for my fallen couterpart. The Impids are known as \"dustrunners\" in-universe, though, due to how fast they are on foot.\n\nKnowing Rimworld, that bastard is probably still out there.\n\nAlso, in my blind lust for bloody vindication, I wasn't paying close attention to Alex's corpse. The colony's pet fennec fox, Earbo, was peckish so he waltzed up and ate her head, flak helmet and all. The little fucker.\n\nI FUCKING love this game.\n\nI know above I promised two stories, but this review is way too long, so I'll write the second story, my favourite, as a comment.\n\nThe first mutual friend to ask gets this game and the DLC for free, no questions asked, I will comment once this has been claimed. Thanks for reading <3\n\nBless u Tynan, I'm sure you don't need me to tell you, but you're a artist in a million. PLEASE reach out to Chris Hunt (Lo-Fi games/Kenshi) and u guys can collaborate to make the greatest piece of open ended emergent video game art known to mankind. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1693880171, "timestamp_updated": 1693880171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145637838": {"recommendationid": "145637838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128122399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 5429, "last_played": 1695786738}, "language": "english", "review": "This has to be one of the most frustrating, bs, rage inducing games ive ever played.

As its a niche genre thats not to everyone liking.\nIf it grabs you like it has me. Then get the DLCs.\nRoyalty adds a new faction that you can gain noble ranks in and get special requests from them like asking for military or resource support.  Also Psycast power. Being able to raise rock walls for cover or teleporting a raider infront of your turrets are just a few examples.\n\nIdeology simply lets you change the rules of the base game. In the base game cannibalism is always bad (unless they have the canabal trait) with ideology your can make your entire colony like human meat.  Or not mind wearing tainted cloths.  OR you can make it harder.  Like massive mood debuffs for cutting down trees or killing animals. Its a great tool for themeing your colony. Also adds rituals which is fun, you can now have public executions for prisoners or have a dance party to give everyone a mood buff, or have 2 prisoners fight each other for everyones fun.  Cool stuff. But the DLC is mainly about adjusting rules to fit your colony theme to play the game in different ways.\n\nBiotech adds the most in way of features. It adds procreation and children. Adds genetics so you can have different \"races\" of humans from the fire breathing imp people, the toxic wasters, or even furry wolf people.  But these are just examples for you to get inspired and make your own. Be it before you start your colony or durring a run by collecting and buy genes and make your own super soldier if you want, most people just make cat-girls.  Oh, and theres vampires, immortals that cant die, but must feed!\nAnother feature it adds is allowing you to now have your own mechanoids!  And they have there own mechanics to making, controlling and calling in \"boss\" fights to get more special chips you need to research bigger and badder mechs.  I like having a squad of scythers, they tear raiders up!  But the MVP is the cleaner bot.\n\nAnd yes, after you play all that then you can venture into the land of mods and expand your experience beyond. Rimworld is one of them games that have mods for everything.  Every QoL you can think of and many many more you never thought of, to new features or expanded on existing ones.  And best part is nearly every mod maker incorporates settings you can adjust in game to fine tune the balance do your liking. or cherrypick features of mods you like while turning parts off you dont.

I usually play MMOs, and games like Stardew Valley, Skyrim, and Subnautica.  RimWorld has already become one of my favorite experiences, with so much depth and freedom in how you play. I learned a lot with my first colony and still feel like I hardly scratched the surface of what's here. \n\nMy first colony was \"complete\" (they made it to space!!) after ~ 110 hours and I am HOOKED.

While Dwarf Fortress may have more detail and depth, its interface creates a barrier to learning. Rimworld eases this barrier with a much more forgiving interface but similar depth, once you begin to explore Mods. The only flaw to the design is the total lack of \"game design\" in terms of \"levels / goals / quests.\" It is a truly sandbox experience, and while survival at first takes center stage as the driving purpose/force, it's easy to get lost and wonder \"what am I doing?\" after awhile. Still, the constant flow of really new and creative mods keeps the game fresh, and a very lively and active streamer community assembles modpacks, themes, and driving goals that help to fill in the gap left by the lack of level/goal/story design. This is a hidden gem that is just waiting for someone to make a really beautiful storytelling framework and create content to explore. Once you're ready, try some of the medieval modpacks with magic to really get blown away at how dynamic and flexible the Rimworld base system is. You won't believe you're playing the same game.

But recent Christmas sale allowed me to finally buy the game and support Tynan. Rimworld allowed me to discover a new genre of game i never really thought I would like. The amount of stuff you can do in this game is ridiculous. I think the role-playing aspect of the game is the true seller for me since I can create colonies with many different characters of different species and skills and backstories and personalities. Bases can also vary depending on taste, from tribal, medieval, concentration camp (the classic rimworld experience), or some advanced futuristic base. It's all tied together with the events that can finally occur when you start the game. You just never know what could happen to your colonists and colony, be it thrilling, tragic, hilarious, boring, or victorious. Mods also contribute to this varying experience. So buying rimworld isn't just buying 1000 hrs worth of content, but years of content thanks to the amazing modding community. Overall it's amazing. My playtime is kind of reduced tho since I mostly make my own mods these days which only allows me to play the game for testing purposes most of the time. But before i got into the whole modding thing, i was playing hundreds of hours of rimworld, so trust me when i say these things lol. Buy the game.

But man, if you get super into this and really kinda let things happen in the game, it's incredible. \n\nThe fact that I can say to my girlfriend \"Oh today on Rimworld, our llama who has dementia wandered out of the pen and pissed off a herd of elephants who then rampaged through my village while one of us was having our ceremony to become a cool noble space knight, and destroyed our weed farm in the process\" is enough to put this game in my top ten favorite games any day. \n\nThe UI can be clunky at times, and it's a lot to look at the first time you boot it up. It's got little tricks you eventually learn throughout playing, like holding down X and clicking walls you want to delete, or linking storage settings in big store rooms for easier controlling what goes in and out of that room. At times it can be very micromanagey, and the UI doesn't help a ton with that micromanaging, but once you get down the game it's easy, and you can set and forget a lot of stuff. \n\nYou can play this game a lot of different ways. I started off my little colony on peaceful mode and just kinda vibed, making the communist utopia of my dreams, completed with required weed smoking everyday at breakfast at a big dinner table in the middle of the communal garden. My friend plays his as a violent, slave owning warlord who burns everything to the ground. I've had other friends play super zealous paladin people. It's wild. So much of the game depends on how you initially set it up, Peaceful is very fun, but so is ultra hard everything kills you mode. It just depends on what you're feeling, but this game has something for everyone I believe. \n\nThe game is nothing crazy to look at. It doesn't have stunning graphics, but if you're into this type of game I'm sure you're used to games not looking like AAA titles. That's not why we're here in this section of steam lol.\n\nAnyway, if you've played games like Dwarf Fortress or Space Haven, or any other story generator colony game, this is the daddy of them all. and I mean that in the very sexy way. Also please for the love of god mod this game. There's so many banger mods out there. \n\nSeriously. The game is good on it's own. But the game becomes WAY better with mods.\n\nokay anyway buy this game if you want a game that literally anything can happen thanks luv u bye", "timestamp_created": 1688756282, "timestamp_updated": 1688756282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141535397": {"recommendationid": "141535397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158488402", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 13989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11482, "last_played": 1689985780}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely game 10/10\ncut a guys limbs of to turn him into a blood bank for my near immortal demigod vampire who is high on a drug that will kill him if he ever stops taking it 24/7.\nalso his dog is named spots :)", "timestamp_created": 1688748162, "timestamp_updated": 1688748162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141511386": {"recommendationid": "141511386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085924648", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 50083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 657, "playtime_at_review": 45266, "last_played": 1695907514}, "language": "english", "review": "After the shit I've done in this game, I'm definitely on some government watch lists", "timestamp_created": 1688723120, "timestamp_updated": 1688723292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141484945": {"recommendationid": "141484945", "author": {"steamid": "76561199503123752", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1692866987}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\ude4c", "timestamp_created": 1688686325, "timestamp_updated": 1688686325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141412452": {"recommendationid": "141412452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321086550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 92212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "playtime_at_review": 85960, "last_played": 1696465163}, "language": "english", "review": "ssmlaksd;ad;;;;12;45;;aslodcokz;lkxj;lb;vc;;c;;z;;;;;;;;;;", "timestamp_created": 1688605315, "timestamp_updated": 1688605315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141379366": {"recommendationid": "141379366", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467456495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1689446509}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041c\u0434\u0430\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u044b \u044f \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0447\u0438\u043b. \u0423\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0441 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0448\u0438\u043b \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b.

Eventually I got bored, so I played many different city builders. None of them really scratched the itch, rarely exceeding 20 hours of play-time. \n\nI then saw a play-through of Rimworld, and I was immediately enamored. It looked like you could do everything you can think of - grow crops, design the perfect village, brew beer, breed polar bears, and even turn your people into vat-grown fire-worshiping drug-addled cyborg cannibals. I saw a tremendous amounts of room for RP and tons of challenging and complex decision making. \n\nSo I booted up the game, played the tutorial, and continued the run. Not knowing much about the game, I ordered my colonists to make a bunch of rooms, prioritize researching drug production, and eat some foraged berries. I quickly realized this game is incredibly complex as my electrical components deteriorated outside, my deer kills rotted, and my colonists hated their dirty barracks and each-other. I spent alot of time studying the game UI, getting a feel for my colony's work load through trial and error, and meticulously configuring stockpiles. More challenges faced me as my crops and colonists felt the effects of winter, got permanent injuries to social fights and bandit raids, and even faced deaths to malaria. \n\nBefore I knew it, I had 50 hours in this game - my colony consisted of nearly 15 people, we had incredible security in wealth/arms/food, and I eventually sent my original three colonists into space - with alot of challenges along the way. \n\nI realized I only scratched the surface of this game as I perused the wiki for efficient ways to run the colony, installed all of the DLC content, and downloaded a myriad of mods. I played about a dozen more runs, all of them different due to the colonists, the DLC and mod parameters, and even the starting biomes and landforms. \n\nIn conclusion, this is THE game if you are looking for a colony sim/city builder/RP box. After climbing over the initial learning curve, you will find yourself appreciating the game's incredible depth and you will always be discovering different ways to play and interesting things to do.

First off it is a slow moving game and graphically somewhat hideous so if looks are something you care much about then you probably shouldn't get it. But if you care more about the incredibly unique brutal and hilarious story aspect of the game then buy it immediately. You can basically have whatever type of colony you want too, Expample: i recently owned 2 slaves (in game) and they tried to rebel so i beat one of them to death in \"self defence\" and the survivor was punished via chopping off her nose and making her eat it. On the other hand i've had a colony that was a peaceful thriving village with farms and happy children. So obviously there are many different sides to rimworld which is just one of the reasons it's so amazing and more significantly, so detailed and in a way insanely realistic. One example of the sheer detail in this game is the injuries, your colinists or \"pawns\" can suffer from lacerations, cuts, bruises, bullet wounds of different calibers and more. Now for my last point which is mods. The modding is extensive in rimworld and the DLC's also add so much to the game (biotech is the best DLC by far) but the mods are super easy to install, literally one button in the steam workshop. The essentials that i reccomend the most are all of the Vanilla Expanded mods by Oscar Pocthki or smtn like that , along with this is the combat extended mods and also the more injuries mod but i dont reccomend it when you're a new player. Anyways you should immediatley but please please for the love of god watch a tutorial because without it you'll be clueless and get r@ped by the storyteller, good luck", "timestamp_created":

As a player, you're tasked with managing a group of survivors who have crash-landed on a harsh and unforgiving planet. From there, you'll need to build a base, gather resources, research new technologies, and fend off threats ranging from raiders to wild animals to natural disasters.\n\nOne of the things that sets RimWorld apart from other games in its genre is the sheer depth and complexity of its systems. Every colonist has their own unique skills, traits, and quirks that can affect their performance and interactions with others. Additionally, the game features a detailed health and injury system, which adds an extra layer of challenge and realism.\n\nDespite its difficulty, RimWorld is also incredibly rewarding. There's nothing quite like watching your colony grow and thrive, or seeing a group of colonists overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to survive. And because the game is procedurally generated, each playthrough is different, which means you'll never run out of new challenges to tackle.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend RimWorld to anyone who enjoys strategy or simulation games. Its deep systems, engaging storytelling, and rewarding gameplay make it a must-play title for fans of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1677218775, "timestamp_updated": 1677218775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133449883": {"recommendationid": "133449883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981058670", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 998, "last_played": 1689641523}, "language": "english", "review": "Think the Sims, but cyanide and happiness", "timestamp_created": 1677194272, "timestamp_updated": 1677194272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133430330": {"recommendationid": "133430330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100765148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3990, "last_played": 1684533407}, "language": "english", "review": "66 hours in and I've only just got off planet.

It's a game that makes you both laugh and cry as you guide your colony of hapless survivors through the perils of a hostile, procedurally generated planet.\n\nAs you start the game, you're greeted with a set of colonists who are as flawed as they come. One has a bad back, another is an insomniac, and yet another is a cannibal. It's your job to keep them alive, despite the game throwing every curveball it can at you. Maybe your colony is hit by a toxic fallout, or a pack of manhunting squirrels. Or perhaps a raider faction decides they want what you have and attack your colony. Either way, you're in for a wild ride.\n\nBut RimWorld isn't just about managing your colony's survival. It's also about the stories that emerge as you play. Maybe your bionic-limbed colonist falls in love with the blind, pacifist herbalist. Or perhaps your colony is visited by a group of traders who turn out to be slavers, leading to an epic battle for the freedom of your fellow colonists. The sheer variety of events that can occur is staggering, making each playthrough feel unique and fresh.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable parts of RimWorld is the ability to mod the game to your heart's content. From adding new items and events to creating your own scenarios, the modding community for RimWorld is robust and active. It's always exciting to see what new mods come out, and how they can change the game in unexpected ways.\n\nIn conclusion, RimWorld is a game that is both funny and heart-wrenching, and never fails to keep you on your toes. Its unique mix of survival, storytelling, and modding possibilities make it a game that you can play for hours and still find something new to discover. If you're looking for a game that is both challenging and entertaining, RimWorld is definitely worth a try. Just be prepared to lose a few colonists along the way.", "timestamp_created": 1676270585, "timestamp_updated": 1676270585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

You can make your own choices in any way you want to, and it\u2019s incredibly satisfying to see the progress you make. While there is an end to the game, you can take your time as there is no pressure to complete it. There is plenty of content in the base game without DLC\u2019s and I thoroughly enjoyed most of the hours I played without them.\n\n\tIt should be noted that the beginning of the game is very slow and quite boring. When you start a game it eases you into it, so you can learn how to play without being overwhelmed. I knew that I would be able to enjoy the game later on, but it still took me 3-4 attempts to push through the beginning. It\u2019s a good thing I did, because once the game started to pick up speed, it became addicting. Players should keep this in mind when they play for the first time.\n\n\tAnalytical people will especially enjoy this game as later in the game, you will find things you can consistently improve in. For example, things like making specific paths to reduce walk time and increase productivity. You can also improve by carefully making schedules and work for each person to do by assigning a few people to build things, a few to work with plants, and some to work with animals. Or if you have a colonist with no skills, make them clean the colony so no one else has to. Having a colonist join and re-shaping the colonist\u2019s work is immensely satisfying when you see them becoming increasingly efficient. \n\n\tThere is Rimworld meme about how you should never ask what awful things people who play it do on there, which makes sense because you can do (almost) anything you could think of, no matter how awful. Prisoners can be set free to gain reputation with their faction, or you can recruit them to yours; but what if you hate everyone and don\u2019t need their skills? Well then you can harvest their organs to be sold to traders. Worried that they\u2019ll try to escape? Replace their legs with wooden pegs so they can\u2019t run. Is a colonist being mean to everyone by saying rude things? Remove their tongue so they can\u2019t speak. You can grow \u201csmokeleaf\u201d and \u201cpsychoid\u201d plants to be processed into drugs and sell them, buy and sell slaves, or even psychologically torture people who have wronged you. In this game, morality becomes frivolous to progress the colony. This is what makes Rimworld so engaging and unique from other games in this genre. \n\n\tEven though there\u2019s so many good things about Rimworld, every game has its faults; this is no exception. Some issues I have with the game are subjective, but I\u2019ve seen most of them mentioned before pretty much everywhere I look in this context.\n\n\tLater in the game you\u2019ll notice a lot of lag as the game runs on only a single core of your CPU. Late game colonies will become insufferable and eventually impossible to play because of the performance. You\u2019ll notice this when there\u2019s a lot on the screen such as being raided or invading other colonies. As you do these things the game will grind to less than 10fps, and sometimes will practically become a slideshow. It becomes discouraging to play as sometimes the game will only run fine for a few moments, and then go back to the low quality performance, which frustrating to say the least. \n\n\tThe game is also full of tiny aspects that will be annoying when you play. Usually these relate to \u201crealistic\u201d behavior. Although realism isn\u2019t necessary in games, it can become annoying when something happens that wouldn\u2019t or is unlikely to happen in real life. This only applies to small, but prevalent behaviors in how the characters act.\n\n\tAnother issue I have with the game is that sending colonists on caravans somewhere outside the colony isn\u2019t as valuable as having them inside the colony to complete objectives; Especially early-game as you only have a limited amount of people, so if you send your builder out, you can\u2019t build anything efficiently until they return. Additionally, there really isn\u2019t any reason to leave the colony until much later. The only thing you\u2019ll really leave the colony for is to trade with other factions. \n\n\tRimworld has a huge modding community, so much so that it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll see players running the game without mods. This is due to the previous things I\u2019ve mentioned, but if it\u2019s not the case of fixing something that you don\u2019t like, then it\u2019s to add content in the game, some of which fitting so well, that its surprising that it\u2019s not already there in the first place. You can go as far as to say it\u2019s difficult to play without some of them. \n\n\tOverall, the problems I have are massively outweighed by the positive aspects, but unfortunately still do exist in the game, and can be impossible to ignore. Every game has its issues, but nevertheless, Rimworld will steal a lot of time from you if you let it. Entire days will be lost to watching colonists interact, improving absolutely everything, trading, and exploring. I love this game with all my heart, and I hope other games follow in its footsteps.\n", "timestamp_created": 1675812394, "timestamp_updated": 1675812394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132357064": {"recommendationid": "132357064", "author": {"steamid": "76561199189107364", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1675323320}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY SHIT! \n\nI never thought in a million years that i would enjoy this game as much as i do.

Trader was a real cyborg, a human with all bionics parts and things. He had last technology armor and weapon as well. When I checked his goods there were 20k silver,150 components, 350 medicine, lots of power armor, etc. My inner raider came up when I saw the items and I started to make a plan. The plan was simple, we had a guest from a high-tech colony and he had power armor and bionics as well he would fight with the trader 1-1 and the other colonist would attack him with their revolver and bolt action rifles. We started to act on our plan everything was perfect at the beginning but there were 2 things we did not predict\u2026 first thing the trader had 3 polar bears in their convoy, and the second thing the guest we were trusting started to run away after he killed the trader. We had no chance to win against 3 polar bears with ranged weapons. Bears catch our colony leader and bite off his head and they started running away with carrier buffalos. At the end of the day, we did not get anything but a failed quest, got 2 high-tech hostiles and a dead leader. Our morals were bottom and I thought it was the end but we did not surrender! We assigned a new leader and got new colonies and a refugee family with a child as a quest. Everything was perfect till another trader shows up again. Same concept but double the items amount and prizes. I knew Randy was testing me but I learned my lesson hard way so this time would be different. Firstly, I bought all pet cobras that the trader had, secondly, instead of attacking I arrested him with one of my colonists and then slaughtered all the carrier muffalos. That was indeed a clean victory, after 10 days of carrying the items that I stole from the trader we finally had a chance to make our raider colony more powerful just with only one raid. Unfortunately, the expectation became high as fuck and my colony started to be more depressive and miserable. Then a raid alert with 15 people with snipers and auto pistols showed up. I knew that was a continue-or-die situation. I armed all of the people in my colony I even armed a refugee child and her mother with a kitchen knife in order to hold the line. But they were too many and we had no chance to hold it, they injured all my colony members and killed the refugee mom, kidnapped her children, and all of my colony as well. I was hopelessly watching my colony be kidnapped by savages then my savior arrived... MAN IN BLACK! He killed the guy who was carrying my colony leader and put our leader on a bed and tended him. I was crying and thinking maybe it wasn't the end at the same time. I did not give up I healed our wounds and started to rebuild our base, the only thing that delaying our rebuild was fucking mental of our leader. He was getting mental disorders every 3 days. It was getting hard and harder to keep him under control. Then another raid alert showed up this time there was only one man yes he was the guest himself that I used to kill the first trader. He came up to take his revenge. Thanks to our mental statement we couldn't finish building walls around the base. Mf was walking with %250 efficiency and he had a fucking chainsaw and a shield as well. He butchered and downed the man in black and downed my leader and kidnapped the man in black and ran to the horizon. On a rainy day our leader once again lying on the ground witnessed the kidnapping of his friend, asking for help... Once again I thought this is the end then a half-pig half-human refugee came up to my colony and rescued our leader and tended his wounds. There is still hope for us to recover but then our leader could not hold anymore and he went into a coma statement, he ain't waking up or eating, only breathing in the bed. After 5 days in coma, he woke up and started to work but this time big refugee could not hold it and started gazing around the base. ANOTHER raid alert showed up and this time there were 2 people from \"6th HellWalkers\" I knew that day would come, I knew they would come for me... the leader tried to escape and hide in a single-line hall with steel bear traps that were the only defense we had. They killed the pig in a second and tried to kill the leader as well first one hit the trap and died but the second one... mf danced around traps and cut the leader in half with a monosword. He took the leader's body as a prize and left.

No, I am not talking about the laws of thermodynamics. I am talking about Rimworld. It\u2019s a Pandora's box that I can\u2019t get out of.\nSure, you can win the game, at a high cost of course. The charm of the game is tactically managing resources and human talents. On paper, it would make sense to allocate more resources to unskilled pawns with greedy or jealous traits who you are promoting with higher titles while ordering mentally stable pawns working overtime. Under this logic, a useless pawn would spend most of its time meditating in an 80 square throne room with lavish meal in its inventory while a large population lives in a 2X2 square single bed room and only allowed simple meals and herbal medicine. Needless to say, the peasant pawns would be assigned to melee attack in the front line while the precious titled pawns are standing in the safe zone and trying to make history.\nBut what if, I wonder, Wiking\u2019s happiness theory and Bregman\u2019s human kindness theory could work in this hush \u201creality\u201d (i.e., starve to survive in Randy)? Would a free, high quality healthcare system survive in this simulation game? How about democracy and a check-and-balances system? I decided to prioritize happiness (mood level) above technology progress and colony wealth as a social experiment. Yes, I know this is not a cutesy game like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing. (I mean\u2026 have you checked the Ideology DLS?) But I was just curious what if I only assign 6 hours of working hours with 3 hours of recreation hours so that they can spend them in extremely impressive recreation room; allow everyone - including guest refugees - glitter medicine; rather promoting one pawn to the highest title but spreading honors equally among 3 pawns according to how popular they are among the colonists?\nSure, in the end, it\u2019s a happy and well-defend colony. But guess what, it\u2019s Randy; you can\u2019t break even. You can survive many raids, man/woman hunting packs, and mech clusters, but colonists would still suffer from the inevitable curse of aging (\u201cBirthday: bad back/ dementia\u201d) and heartbreaks. Everyone is happy? Great! But you still can\u2019t prevent love rejections, affairs, and divorces among the colonists. And yes, the Royal DLS added many new technologies to fix these problems, even a serum to revive a dead colonist. But at what cost?

The game's sci-fi setting is out of this world, you'll be building your colony on a distant planet, and all the while, you'll be thinking \"I could build a rocket and go back home, but where's the fun in that?\" The game's mechanics are so deep you'll feel like you're playing a game of chess against yourself. The game's characters are so diverse, you'll want to adopt them all, like a farmer with too many pigs. And the game's modding support is so good, you'll start to question your own reality.\n\nNegative Review:\nRimworld is the ultimate time-suck of a game! The game's sci-fi setting is so captivating you'll forget to eat, sleep and shower. The game's mechanics are so complex, you'll need a PhD to understand them. The game's characters are so diverse, you'll start to question your own sanity. And the game's modding support is so good, you'll start to question the game's reality.

Easily one of my favourite video games that I've ever played, for what that's worth. However I will say that I do think this game requires at least the Royalty DLC to be truly awesome. Without quests, it can tend to get sort of dull if you manage to keep a colony alive for a long time. Or, maybe it's better to say you might start to feel a bit aimless without the randomised guidance of quests (and the \"main\" win-the-game ones). With that being said, I'll just list off some things I love and dont love about the game as they come to me.\n\nThings I love:\n- Customisation - You can literally do whatever you want. Make a cannibal cult, make the space police, make a horrible, inefficient stone age tribe and see what idiocy they do.\n- Mods - You can easily just click on cool looking mods on the Steam Workshop. I like the ones that let you fine-tune stuff like the Prepare Carefully mod. It lets you make your own custom characters/pawns instead of hitting the \"randomise\" button 100 times until you get someone with a cool combo of stats and traits.\n- Difficulty - The game is hard. Even on the baby mode, until you learn how stuff works, you will kill everyone in your colony repeatedly, until you learn how to prevent food poisoning, or to stop your pawns from putting rotting corpses in your fridge. Once you learn the mechanics and 'rules' you can then fine-tune the difficulty however you want. The game by default lets you play with %'s for anything from difficulty of threats, extremes in temperatures or climate, how often threats appear, and even lets you change who the \"storyteller\" is at any time. Different AI that have a different style. One gradually increases difficulty and causes threats at set intervals, one gives huge downtime between attacks but rapidly increases strength, and one is complete random, each saving any changes or parameters you set at the beginning.\n- Story - This game has fairly bare bones when it comes to story. Either you're a tribe native to the planet or you've crashed from space and are trying to escape this Rimworld to get back to civilisation. But it's because of the \"lack\" of a hard narrative that it's storytelling is so good. The stuff your pawns do (on their own or by your mind control) forms a story itself. I had a woman marry and divorce three men, only to have two of the exes get killed, which caused her psyche to snap, and she started a fist fight with her current husband and killing him. It's often morbid, but always silly and entertaining.\n- Morality - You can be as mean or nice as you want to your little imaginary video game people! Give them lush bedrooms and huge dining halls, throne rooms for your leaders and hosting great banquets and celebrations, regularly getting \"Inspirations\" that vastly increase one of your pawns kills for a few days. But it will cost you extremely in planning, materials, and sacrifice. A gaudy colony is a sight to behold because you know it went through a few collapses to get there. Or, you can laugh at your people as you cram them into tiny barracks and tell them to sleep on the dirt even though you've told them to build beds in there. You'll regularly be getting mental breaks where they'll do anything from attacking eachother, setting buildings on fire, or just being sad and hiding in their room for a day, refusing to eat or do anything. But think of all the extra money and resources you'll have. And the guns, goodness the guns you can buy if you neglect amenities!!\n\nThings I dont love:\n- learning curve - It's kinda hard to start playing. There is a fairly good tutorial that does teach you most of what is required to understand. But, there are so many basic steps even when just starting a new colony that you'll regularly forget one or two critical steps. Like, forgetting to tell anyone that they're allowed to cook, and then watch in maddened confusion when they REFUSE to eat anything or make new meals, so everybody ends up eating raw meat and going on mental breaks because of it. \n- powergaming - This game is advertised as a Story Generator. It is not meant to be beaten, and it is extremely difficult to get to the end added by the Royalty DLC (returning to space to go home). As fun as it is to try and save-scum the crap out of this game, and min/max every pawn's skills and traits, the game is best when you let the catastrophes win. That's not how I play games (or, even this game) but sometimes I cant help but laugh when one of my pawns burns down the kitchen and freezer because someone else's bedroom looks nicer than theirs. Set your expectations, or steel yourself to try and overcome a game that will eventually try to break you. For instance, super late game you'll be facing full-scale invasions by upwards of 200 enemies with rocket launchers, miniguns, etc, while your colony of 5-20 hand picked pawns just do whatever they can to prevent death.\n\nI honestly had to sit and think for a bit to decide what to say against the game. Royalty and Ideology are fantastic, and honestly help make the game great instead of fine to good. I know that sounds rough, but it's my opinion. I still think it's worth buying the base game due to mods, but it easily jumps to industry shaping levels of good with the DLC's. I don't own Biotech yet but I'll be getting it during the next sale for sure.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is; When your pawns relatives are in enemy raiding parties, kill them first and then turn their skin into cowboy hats and force your pawns to wear their parents as a hat so that they always get a positive mood bonus for being reminded of their loved ones (that they killed [They'll get over it]). \n\n[b] 11/10, would cannibalise again.

"english", "review": "Rimworld, \n\nmy favorite game of all time, my hours will show you, especially if we are friends are steam, that they constantly go up. personally, this game has ended relationships, brought new friendships, made me a less sociable person even though im out going,  made me panic and also shred real tears of lose. I've only \"beaten\" the game ONCE out of all my hours. my next highest game is around 2,000 hours. the mods are great and supporting the developer is amazing but mods are the lifeblood of this game, without them and all the wonderful mods, i think this game wouldn't have as much of an emotional feeling. you pick a scenarios or edit it yourself, start off with three pawns (colonists) or just one. gradually expanding a base thats your home, hunting deer for food, making crops to feed yourself, mining precious ores to smelt,  and eventually getting weapons and armor. each colonist feels different from one another,  some are snotty people who cant be trusted to do anything and the others are the bread and butter of your colony who cant be allowed to die. he DLC's allow you to make a religion, make babies, or even become a royal to a crumbling empire that can call in favors. im honeslty talking a fraction of each DLC, please review them.  in your religion you can be drug users or my favorite mount crusades killing or converting all in your path. making babies makes you be able to produce more colonists without having to result in capturing prisoners, cannon fodder for warfare or a means to an end? you decide. becoming a royal lets you call on special favors that saves your colonists at certain times. food, luxury,  or material to expand your ever-consuming base or perhaps more soldiers to defend against the horrors of insects or raiders? almost whatever you can imagine can be put into this game with the right mods or personal creativity of your stories. story tellers are there pushing your colonists along with gifts, good weather, or even a tornado that destroys this seasons of grain. making yourself, your own base's story teller is a win-win, which ill get to below.\n\npersonally i like to build a base, make a religion, make sure my colonists are making new blood (babies) to die in future wars for organs, wealth, and even prisoners to later recruit in an never ending cycle of blood.  without trying to touch the game, once i have the primary base finished with the storage locations created and with minimal input from myself, i let the game run in the background of real life work. trusting what i did right; the player, storyteller, god, will allow my colony to thrive and survive. losses are acceptable due to raids, stupid mood swings where a colonist decides to destroy HE shells, etc .some colonists just simply shouldn't live and have more use as chairs or leather hats. if i notice a problem, ill play god (developer mode) and revive a colonist who had their head blown off and resurrect them, taking a role of a storyteller that the colony make some pact with an unseen power to bring them back to life, who eventually down the lines requires a child sacrifce.  or ill spawn some suicide vests (a mod i love) that i make slaves wear to march into the middle of a raid to simply kill and blow up the enemy. once or even if prisoners are taken, thanks to ideology DLC, ill make them fight to the death to win my love, those that win become either esteemed slaves with normal weapons or new colonists, remember raiders aren't humans. those that lose, are sent into combat because i cannot feed them and to make them die would prevent a starvation amongst my more valuable colonist or are turned into clothes and chairs.  thanks to Biotech, i can make my own genes, allowing my colonists to become better killers but have to take drugs that my ideology permits or hates.i can make babies that turn into super soldiers or just slave labour and later discarded if their uses aren't what im needing. i can make vat grown colonists who in time will be sent to defend the colony against the enemy and cant be called upon to grow food or even make a meal. if my colonists all die, eventually (again with a mod) one random stranger might join and make the cycle a new.  \n\nbecoming the storyteller of Rimworld keeps your interest in the game. \n\non a serious note: the DLC's are crucial if you have some experience in the game already. Rimworld's DLCs dont go on sale much (even Rimworld itself doesn't) and if you can afford it, get it. if you cant afford the DLCs that do add some cool content, go with mods.  i personal like Biotech and Ideology, than i recommend the mods that the very active community are giving out. the change the game in so many ways. id pay all of the mod developers for them. you also have to come up with your own stories to make the game fun.  for example why was Jamie such an expendable person? because she wouldn't do dumb labor or produce children to keep your colony up to strength. for the same reason John was just a meat shield in times of raiding or Zax was assent that couldn't be allowed to die because of his great political ability or genes that i needed to produce more soldiers. the possibilities are endless.\n\nRimworld is a learning experience. play with developer mod until you get it right. like i said above, i only beat the game ONCE, i didn't have to, but after i beat it after 500 hours i finally got mods that drastically changed my game where i had to relearn it. you also don't have to become the killing machine colony like i talked about, that's how i play the game (i insanely like Warhammer 40,000 and taken a lot from the novels, i even have a quote tattoed to me, To partake in our crusade, is to be immortal) you could create a colony of peaceful non-combatants who desire to become high all the time. seriously with the right amount of story playing, base building, colony management, the possibilities are almost endless.\n\n i love Rimworld, ill play it forever and ever until i'm dead. the game has even saved my life, i have often decided to play it drunk and skip parties that i'd have driven to and possibly crashed and died. honestly it has happened more than once. when my girlfriend broke up with me i played the game, it made me sane again.  the development team is amazing, the people adding mods are amazing, it just comes down to you playing it. if the game doesn't make you happy, add me as a friend on steam and ill send you paragraphs on why you should push on. in fact there is a mod where you could play multiplayer. Rimworld will be my favorite game ever made no matter if the developers randomly decided to stop developing it. of course, any game can burn you out, but Rimworld has mods. \n\nto think i only talked about a little of the game to write this review. just don't forgot to make tables. \n\n(i do not have the best grammar and spelling mistakes are bound to happen, please excuse.)", "timestamp_created": 1674618994, "timestamp_updated": 1674618994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131489765": {"recommendationid": "131489765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230727196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3995, "last_played": 1682193989}, "language": "english", "review": "I watched my partner play this years ago and wasn't interested.

Three people crash land in a savage and unforgiving land with no hope for rescue. They manage to build a small camp for themselves, but amidst their desperate daily struggle to adapt, they're beset upon by raiders; barely surviving the conflict, they cling to their civility and humanity. They treat the surviving raider, save him from his harrowing withdrawal and invite him to stay. Danny, the massive former pirate swears to repay their generosity someday.\n\nWeeks become months and their first winter arrives. They're woefully unprepared. Their hunting skills are poor, and the crops wither. Just as they begin work on a greenhouse, the neighbouring savages mount a surprise assault. Shots are fired at the hapless survivors, molotov flames engulf their huts and storehouses, burning nearly all of their belongings to the ground; yet somehow they survive the day.\n\nTheir choices are to commit cannibalism or starve. Each make the same grim choice. Every bite changes them; chipping away at what little remained of their humanity, and they decide to survive no matter how heartless they'd need to be in the days ahead.\n\nTravellers arrive now and again with meager items to trade and barter, only to be taken captive and put to work in labour camps. Any sign of rebellion is met with the scalpel. Our survivors learned that there are immense profits to be earned from healthy organs.\n\nThey entrench themselves in a mountain they'd quarried out through brutal prison labor. With the money from the organ trade, they establish a powerful base of operations, and finally they feet safe. The feeling doesn't last. There is no God; the rim punishes the strong and meek alike.\n\nIn the deepest cavern of the mountain, they'd furnished a research station, and a production line for clothing and weaponry. The group spend the majority of their time here while the prisoners pay in sweat or blood.\n\nWithout warning, the ground burst open and insectoid abominations spring forth with pincers and scythe like appendages slashing at any human in sight.\n\nCaught completely unawares, they scramble for dear life, but Danny screams at everyone to make for the door. The leader saw through bloodshot eyes that Danny had grabbed several grenades and ran headlong into the creatures and shut the door behind him.\n\nThe ensuing explosion shook the mountain. The research room became a tinderbox, and everything inside turned to ashes.\n\nIt took days for the shock to wear off. The prisoners were starving and near revolt. The survivors sat around a fire, and the leader spoke first. He said that in their final conversation before the attack, Danny spoke of his regrets. It pained him to see how the kindhearted people who saved his life had become so cruel, but he didn't know how steer them back.\n\nThe survivors agreed then, that they'd again change course. They'd end their organ trade, and they'd strive to be good, in Danny's memory.\nThey fed and tended the prisoners and gave them the option to leave or stay. If they stayed, they'd be treated as equals, and reparations would be made for their treatment.\n\nTwo of the dozen prisoners left, swearing their revenge. Now a group of thirteen entering into spring they set to work on rebuilding.\n\nThey spent two years mending their relationships with their neighbors. At first, gifts of reparation, then ceasefire, and eventually alliance.\n\nThe leader was a genius. He developed a tissue printer to fabricate organs, improved prosthesis to a level where they function better than the organic original. Their new trade was in advanced bionic prosthesis, and they'd treat anyone that requested aid.\n\nA decade passes as they continued to grow in spite of the mechanoid threat. Eventually they were able to build a vessel complex enough to sail through space and return to a Glitterworld, but instead of the three who crash landed so many years ago, it was the twenty-four men and women of Fishyville and their dog, Lunaroni.\n\n11/10.

Everything from a single hermit living in a cabin in the woods, living off the land surrounding him to bustling fortresses or mega-cities that fill the entire map with buildings and facilities is possible. No two games of RimWorld are the same, because you can set up in a large variety of biomes each time, from lush jungles to ice sheets at the polar caps, but even if you settle in temperate forests each and every time, what makes the game stand out are the pawns themselves. Each one is unique, from their name to their interests and their interactions between each other. Like I said in the beginning, RimWorld calls itself a story generator and here it is where you really see that premise in action. You can get emotionally attached to your pawns to a degree that makes it feel pretty great to see them thrive, and devastating to lose them to disasters, raids, the environment or hunger if you're really unlucky. \n\nPast the basegame there are three DLCs at time of writing and every single one of them was created with great care by Ludeon. Each one of these deserve their own review, but they speak volumes of the love Ludeon have for their baby. \n\nLastly, the mod support for this game is off the charts. Whatever your hearts desire, if it's not in the game already, there's probably a mod for it.\n\nIn conclusion, 11/10, well worth the 1200 hours I put into it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672833936,

So if you like these kind of games and got a life to waste then I recommend highly!\nPS: Fun thing to do is naming your pawns with your friends names and then tell your friends about what they've been up to in the world of Rimworld, can make for some hilarious stories.", "timestamp_created": 1669636579, "timestamp_updated": 1669636579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127319471": {"recommendationid": "127319471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053224882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 45596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40696, "last_played": 1693577899}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible.", "timestamp_created": 1669598092, "timestamp_updated": 1669598092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127290980": {"recommendationid": "127290980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088062290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3634, "last_played": 1672386341}, "language": "english", "review": "get colonist\ntry to keep them alive\nhave them fight with other colonist\nother colonist hates 1st one \ntry to make up the relationship\n[i] it gets better [/i]\ncolonist fall in love\nhave an awful argument one day\none loses an eye the other a leg\nboth are upset but have to sleep with each other that night\npushes them over the edge and one snaps\nruns outside and attacks the thrumbo herd\ndies in vain since their leg was broken\nother colonist snaps because lover died\nwalks around setting things on fire\ngoes by thrumbos who are now breaking out of pen and into my base\ngets destroyed without even a hit in because of one eye\ncassandra decides this is the best time for a raid just 2 minutes after sending mechanoids\neverything is either burning, being shot, or destroyed.\n>stare at computer wondering why i played this for so long\n>forgo colony and just start a completely new one\n10/10 would play 100 times again", "timestamp_created": 1669582191, "timestamp_updated": 1669582191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127272433": {"recommendationid": "127272433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155153456", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 78032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78032, "last_played": 1669572817}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game when it was in beta, around December 2017. \n\nVery addicting, AMAZING soundtrack. In the first 2 months, I logged over 300 hours in this game lol. Over 1000 hours later, and I'm still not bored of it. Not to mention the devs keep coming out with more DLC to spice things up, and there are TONS of great mods for it if vanilla isn't your thing.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bit of learning curve there if you are not used to having to micromanage EVERYTHING, and learning each of the various parts to the game can feel overwhelming at first. But, there is a good inbuilt tutorial that can help you get started, and once you really sink your teeth in (and probably after you've wiped out a few colonies) - you get the hang of it. \n\nIf you like survival colony builders with a lot of challenge and depth, then this is the game for you. Although the colonists look like pawns, each one has a little backstory alongside a set of physical and psychological traits and skills that will effect how they interact with other colonists and the success of the colony overall as you try to survive. The permadeath mode makes the drama all the more real - because the death of a colonist can be so truly impactful on the story each game run tells.  Essentially what the game lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in story-telling and gameplay.\n\nThe game is so comfy and cosy, but equally stressful and you need to have good tactics and strategy for taking on the most deadly enemies. Micro-managing is a must.  At some stage when I figure out how to write better I will update this review to show how awesome this game truly is and how much I really love it. \n\nHighly, highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1669574203, "timestamp_updated": 1669574203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127231388": {"recommendationid": "127231388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040248140", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 13980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13302, "last_played": 1685766247}, "language": "english", "review": "Tasty yum", "timestamp_created": 1669559619, "timestamp_updated": 1669559619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127214563": {"recommendationid": "127214563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029319040", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26496, "last_played": 1670335578}, "language": "english", "review": "Randy is dogwater dont trust youtube", "timestamp_created": 1669554117, "timestamp_updated": 1669554117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127172149": {"recommendationid": "127172149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008578820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10513, "last_played": 1669535925}, "language": "english", "review": "award", "timestamp_created": 1669535804, "timestamp_updated": 1669535804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127158579": {"recommendationid": "127158579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038518813", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 42520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39918, "last_played": 1685303343}, "language": "english", "review": "once you understand how to play it, there is nothing else like it", "timestamp_created": 1669526926, "timestamp_updated": 1669526926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127152133": {"recommendationid": "127152133", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978910044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21681, "last_played": 1691741533}, "language": "english", "review": "unlimited rimming, what more could you want?", "timestamp_created": 1669522776, "timestamp_updated": 1669522776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127140605": {"recommendationid": "127140605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083366781", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 19139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15582, "last_played": 1694052492}, "language": "english", "review": "RimWorld.

In it, you take control over several coloniest or pawns and strive to develop a colony capable of not just surviving life on a bitter rim world, but thriving with the eventual goal of creating a ship to escape back to the stars. Rather than having direct control over the colonists you give general orders to your colony as a whole, tasking them to build buildings, harvest crops or hunt animals. These tasks are completed in an order determined by a combination of pawn priority, skill level, and a small degree of luck depending on the situation.\nRimworld is more than just a colony manager, it is a story generator as any avid player can attest to. Each individual game of Rimworld is different from the last, with random events and player choices making unique memories, whether it be in the form of an escaped farm animal eating a colonies supply of recreational drugs, giant insects eating a group of raiders, or a pawn killing half your colony because he had to eat without a table.\nLudeon Studios has poured a lot of work into Rimworld, but more than creating an incredible game they have also fostered an incredible community, with an active playerbase and an incredibly extensive modding community as well. If there is something you could think to add to Rimworld, there probably already is a mod for it.\nWith both an incredible base game and extensive mods available, Rimworld is an easy recommendation for any person looking to lose a few thousand hours in a colony management sim.", "timestamp_created": 1669161685, "timestamp_updated": 1669161685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126073523": {"recommendationid": "126073523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025706739", "num_games_owned": 1298, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1689017026}, "language": "english", "review": "Much Rim such World", "timestamp_created": 1669155517, "timestamp_updated": 1669155517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126055123": {"recommendationid": "126055123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066388434", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 50324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "playtime_at_review": 18692, "last_played": 1695512093}, "language": "english", "review": "The Steam Awards for 2022 is live, and RimWorld is eligible for Labor of Love Award!

Turn the natural resources into your home and your food. Grow raw produce and hunt animals to create food. Chop down wood and mine for resources to build and craft. Research new technologies to improve the way your colonist live and defend themselves. Build defenses and craft weapons to defend yourself against the unwashed hordes of pirates, enemy tribes and robots. And before you know it, you have yourself a well-oiled machine that can self-sustain itself.\n\nThis game, is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in a game in a very long time. There is just so much you can do and no two playthroughs will ever be the same. The storytellers help create a fresh experience each and every time you play. Randomized events, pawns and factions give upon thee challenges and goals to strive towards. Relatively simple yet complex building systems can please those who like building; while similarly complex combat systems will please the Strategy and RTS gamers. \n\nDifficulty settings can range from Peaceful with no threats, to semi-challenging but fair, all the way to a merciless brutal setting that challenges everything you know. If those aren't specific enough, you can adjust specific settings to create an ideal play style for you. Don't be afraid to take it easier if you find that it gets overwhelming; or if you're not feeling challenged enough, ramp those sliders up for a tougher challenge. There is no \"right\" way to play this game, and I find that beautiful.\n\nThe game has a bit of a learning curve at the start but once you overcome it, however the game has a exponential fun curve as well. I recommend, at least for your first colony to not be afraid of save-scumming. Events can and mostly likely will happen that can completely wipe your colony of the face of the map and sometimes your colonists might just walk straight into a firefight cause they do not have common sense LOL.\n\nEach of the DLCs are fantastically crafted, which expand heavily upon the base game and create brand new ways to expand and personalize your playthrough.\n\nRoyalty gives you opportunities to build a standing with your local empire, allowing a colonist to rise through the ranks of the monarchy. You can gain benefits of a new trading partner, calling for labor or defensive favors, and unlocking a new way to complete the game by reaching the highest rank and getting a free ride of the planet.\n\nIdeology completely shakes up the game by allowing you to create a religion and culture that's catered to the way you like to play. Like staying underground in mountains? You can make your colonists love the dark, being inside and be spectacular at mining; but also hate the outdoors and sunlight. Want your colonists to be a horde of violent cannibals? You can set your colonists to love human meat and love raiding; but can get restless if they don't go out and pillage. I have yet to play this DLC, but the implications and the possibilities is definitely worth a recommendation from me. \n\nFinally, the most recent release of Biotech adds even more to the ever expansive list of things to do. Children, genetic modification and the ability to control robots (mechanoids). I haven't gotten too in depth into this expansion yet, however a brand new level of management with children, being able to tailor suit your colonists with perks and downsides, as well as create your own robotic defense and labor force is a great new step into the expanse that is RImworld.\n\nAnd finally. once you've become acquainted with Rimworld's oddities and systems; I would 100% recommend looking into modding your experience. The mod community is massive and regularly updates. Definitely check out some of the QoL mods like \"Common Sense,\" or \"Pick Up n' Haul,\" which can make a big difference for improving efficiency and preventing some stupid behaviors. I recommend checking out Noobert on YouTube, he has plenty of videos that give some great recommendations for mods and has some great content. Mods can also greatly expand the content in the game, check out Vanilla Expanded Pack, which can easily be considered an unofficial Expansion pack. Heck, if you're a fan of making your own modifications; the game's modding scene is fairly easy to get into.\n\nOverall, Rimworld is very massive in scope and has infinite replayability. You could have colonies that last a year the go down in a barrage of flames and disease, or you could have a colony that stands the tests of time and struggle and create a thriving city. I absolutely love this game and I 100% recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1667428269, "timestamp_updated": 1667428269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124845108": {"recommendationid": "124845108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370423164", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1651424599}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game, fun, workshop, etc etc", "timestamp_created": 1667418092, "timestamp_updated": 1667418092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124842937": {"recommendationid": "124842937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047192726", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 16240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11652, "last_played": 1685398641}, "language": "english", "review": "Obra maestra", "timestamp_created": 1667415251, "timestamp_updated": 1667415251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124811633": {"recommendationid": "124811633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045769091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11034, "last_played": 1690178085}, "language": "english", "review": "The greatest colony sim of all time, by a healthy margin.

Your job is to create a base for them and assign specific tasks for them to do whether it be mining, farming, cleaning, or collecting resources among others.

And if it does, you start again with even more experience and do better and better, but that will never end. It's the perfect gameplay loop of \"But I can do it better next time\", and that's what makes it so fun to play over and over. \n\nOther than this, the modding community is fantastic and has created mods for thousands of different things you can drop into the game to do even better, or make things more difficult. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1666511295, "timestamp_updated": 1666511295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124258881": {"recommendationid": "124258881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051565156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 35103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29951, "last_played": 1688309741}, "language": "english", "review": "Idk, ask me in another 500 hours", "timestamp_created": 1666508615, "timestamp_updated": 1666508615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124243430": {"recommendationid": "124243430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113405079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4246, "last_played": 1683529038}, "language": "english", "review": "this will aways be fun.", "timestamp_created": 1666480543, "timestamp_updated": 1666480543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124238189": {"recommendationid": "124238189", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970851970", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 18472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17331, "last_played": 1668031935}, "language": "english", "review": "Continues to be the best survival story management experience.", "timestamp_created": 1666472495, "timestamp_updated": 1666472495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124229669": {"recommendationid": "124229669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032310737", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 23441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22854, "last_played": 1672697340}, "language": "english", "review": "rimcrack", "timestamp_created": 1666461486, "timestamp_updated": 1666461486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124225853": {"recommendationid": "124225853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189381361", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 39691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37345, "last_played": 1688843525}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1666456903, "timestamp_updated": 1666456903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124222429": {"recommendationid": "124222429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151823767", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 88494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1262, "playtime_at_review": 52873, "last_played": 1696526759}, "language": "english", "review": "This game fucking slaps so hard, it is the best thing to touch this earth.

Kevin, who liked to hunt, Mikhail, who was a little all-around, and had a slight bit of first aid knowledge, and No, who was our doctor. A wild man locked himself in our refrigerator, ate all the food there, and starved to death without our notice. The colonists were able to restock the food paste machine but kept getting upset that there was a corpse hanging around. I hadn't managed to get them to build a crematory yet. To get the corpse out of their sight Kevin thought he'd butcher him and turn him into kibble. That way the corpse would be gone and the livestock would have something to eat for a while. It upset him more than he thought to prepare it but he recovered and moved on. Then we collected a prisoner named Michael who was injured. We were in the midst of nursing him back to health when the doctor, No, decided to starve himself half to death then eat the human kibble. The food paste machine was functional and fully stocked and he was supposed to eat it but no. No got upset that he'd been hungry. He got further upset that he ate kibble. Then he got Really upset when he realized the kibble was human. He abandoned the injured prisoner and went on a sad wander. While this was going on, a panther or jaguar or something got too close to our camp and started causing trouble. Both Kevin and Mikhail decided to fight it off. Mikhail got scratched up pretty badly and started to bleed profusely. Kevin took him to the infirmary and tried to tend to him as well as he could without any medical skill. He managed to stop the bleeding then ran over to try to save the prisoner that No had abandoned but the prisoner died. Kevin was very stressed trying to keep people alive. Mikhail developed an infection in his leg. Kevin snapped and had a psychotic break. He went to find No and tried to beat him to death. Luckily he got distracted by the livestock once No fell to the ground and he eventually got taken out by a goose. No was able to pull himself together a little and went to tend to Mikhail's infection. It was running rampant and to prevent him from going septic he was going to have to amputate.

This reality began to grow in mind as an unpleasant one; it is the feeling one has when they wish they could forget their favorite book, only to have the intense pleasure of reading it again for the 'first' time. This second first reading is not given to us. We must console ourselves instead with browsing further afield, while secretly knowing that what we really expect is to be disappointed. Typically we are.\n\nThe second point; quite without knowing it, Rimworld has changed the way I approach gaming. No longer for me the endless, mindless grind; let me build a system, and then step back and enjoy its operation. How many of these thousand hours did I spend simply watching the game play, when there was nothing left to build? In most survival games the micromanagement is inescapable. I find them almost unplayable now. Rimworld is psychologically satisfying in this respect--beginning with scarcity, and lacking everything, you can over time begin to achieve a measure of security and stability. \n\nThird point; Mods can make a game, or break one. I probably spent the first four or five hundred hours playing strictly vanilla. My modlist is always changing, but whatever mods I run, I very rarely run without them now. When I do rarely play a vanilla run, I notice two things; it lacks the depth I've grown accustomed to, and it's more difficult than I remember. Have mods turned me into a soft target?\n\nLastly, everything has its time and everything dies. I might be losing interest in games, or maybe I just need a long break. But if there's ever a time to rethink one's priorities, the thousand-hour mark is as good as any. And yet I feel I can say with confidence that, sooner or later, I'll see you on the Rim.", "timestamp_created": 1665980918, "timestamp_updated": 1665980918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123953141": {"recommendationid": "123953141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079495706", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 73549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73549, "last_played": 1665964675}, "language": "english", "review": "Hours of fun, would do it again, will never get these hours of my life back. :)", "timestamp_created": 1665968055, "timestamp_updated": 1665968055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123949588": {"recommendationid": "123949588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216201143", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 17926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2863, "last_played": 1694293280}, "language": "english", "review": "mmm i love Rimming Randy Random's Robust Rump Repeatedly.

any limits on playstyle. And it will always without fault, make hilarious and tragic stories for you to tell your friends and family.\n\nSo, you want to buy rimworld? Let me tell you about the chaos your about to bring apon yourself. \n\nRimworld is first and foremost a story generator game. Your trapped on a rimworld in the far reaches of space with nothing but your colonists, meager supplies and the bounty of the land before you. And its your job to turn this crashlanding into a thriving colony. Surviving everything the planet throws at you. From people having mental breakdowns to being attacked by a horde of aggressive manhunting squirrels, 200 strong in numbers, and many many more weird events. And you can go about surviving these any way you want. Theres no limits or laws on the Rim. Which allows you to do some really fecked up things to get by. From cannibalism, drug abuse, organ harvesting, slavery and many many other things. \n\nNo two runs will EVER be the same in this game. Theres near infinite replayability. Especially when you name colonists after your friends and family. Yes you will get attached to them, and it will suck when they die. But you can tell that one friend how their rimworld equivalent tried to tame a wild rockhopper penguin by spanking it to assert dominance. Or how they carved two legendary statues that the entire planet knows about, which one depicts another friend becoming incapacitated by drug overdose, and the other friend being shot by an evil overbearing clown (These actually happened and I have photos). And dont even get me started on the mods. \n\nThis game is like Garrys mod. Its good by itself, but absolutely amazing with mods. The modding community in this game is absolutely bonkers. There are mods out there for everyone. From new storytellers (They are the AI overlords that plan out the events to keep your game interesting. All hail Randy Random!), to new weapons, enemies, creatures, biomes, vehicles, buildings, etc. You name it. Its likely there. Theres even mods that allow custom built spaceships you can live on and travel in. Which was never intended in the base game.\n\nThe game also has DLC if you feel like picking those up. Which I highly, highly recommend. As they add so much more flavour to the game. The prices may be quite steep for DLC, but they also act as framework for modders, allowing them to add content onto said DLC for an even greater, more customisable experience. Plus you get to support a pretty damn cool developer in the process. \n\nTheres so much more I could talk about with this game, but I think Ill finish it off here with one last, rather important thing. Due to how the game was made, it *can* run quite slow sometimes if you overload it with mods, even with an extremely powerful PC. As this games ancient engine is unfortunately only able to run on one CPU core without completely breaking the game. And the developers cant really do anything about it, as an engine rewrite to allow it to work on all cores would completely break every single mod on the workshop. However, there ARE mods out there that massively improve performance. My favourite in particular being RocketMan. So do with that what you will. \n\nBut yeah. Thats a small taste of the rimworld experience. Its by far one of my most loved games of all time. The fact the game will without fault make absolutely hilarious, and tragic stories that you can tell your friends and family about is something that keeps the game so entertaining.

I buy a few slaves that I insert mind controlling bionics so they can become my drug runners. I made it so robots couldn't attack me but buffed human attacks and by the late game I'd use massive amounts of poisonous gas to demolish anyone who dares stand in the way of the one who knocks. Eventually I decide I've reached the money I want and just spawn tons of waves of attacks to see if I can hold.\n\nAbout the expansions. They're a bit pricy sure but this is a game where you won't really notice not having the expansions. It's no Paradox game. I recommend them once you've been playing the game a bit. \n\nLastly a reason I love these developers. When the recent DLC Biotech came out it added things like Vampires. The DLC before it, Ideology, added \"ideoligions\". The devs had the philosophy of wanting each DLC to stand on its own so there was no real integration between the new races of Biotech & the Ideologies of Ideology. If people wanted it a mod would be made. People however did massively request this integration of the DLC's so it was added by the developers. I like that they have the philosophy of not making DLC need other DLC, but I love it even more that they listened to players (and this is just one example).\n\nFinal verdict: 0/10: main developer is canadian, also buy his book (Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences)", "timestamp_created": 1687167196, "timestamp_updated": 1687167196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139702981": {"recommendationid": "139702981", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071975723", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5894, "last_played": 1689550395}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game every playthrough is different and interesting i could honestly play this game forever.", "timestamp_created": 1686166825, "timestamp_updated": 1686166825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139702753": {"recommendationid": "139702753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161323098", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 68460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60003, "last_played": 1688331156}, "language": "english", "review": "it's aight", "timestamp_created": 1686166474, "timestamp_updated": 1686166474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135724505": {"recommendationid": "135724505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323845650", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 84024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1478, "playtime_at_review": 70400, "last_played": 1695903542}, "language": "english", "review": "Never thought i'd be happy to see a cult of cannibal slavers thrive\n10/10 i no longer have empathy", "timestamp_created": 1680160200, "timestamp_updated": 1680160200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126334052": {"recommendationid": "126334052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868550294", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 17585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 7894, "last_played": 1696359343}, "language": "english", "review": "I can capture prisoners,cut off their limbs,feed them their friend's meat and harvest them for neurotamine while constantly berating them.\nMy tendencies have been satisfied.

I have over 200 hours and I havent got near to finishing (I never save scum in games so dead is dead). Its basically about a group of your colonists dropped on a hostile planet who have to survive, building protection and a home, trading hunting and growing food. \n\nMy latest game which has just prompted me to write this i was doing so well, had a colony of 7 and 3 prisoners. An enemy group dropped in on my colony in pods and immediatly attacked with my best fighters going down early on in the fight. 2 died, and the other 4 were carried off with only 1 girl surviving who doesnt fight, she hid in the food cellar till they went. Her only choice when they had gone was to go get one of the prisoners and get him to help her. \n\nIts going to be an interesting game from now on, can the two of them survive, will i be able to rescue the kidnapped friends (yes that happens sometimes thats how awesome the game is. Will this colony die now i have only 2 people left. \n\nThese are the things which make this game so great, i would say if you are interested watch some you tube vids and get an idea, if you like the idea of story driven game where its not about winning its about the journey then this game is great for you. If you cant cope with loss and colonies being damaged late game you can always save scum to miss that but i would recommend playing and feeling the struggle and comeback its part of what makes the game great. \n\nSo all in all would really recommend, once you figure more of the game out the more awesome it becomes.\n\nPs i set up a trap in the cave storage to get the bug infestations we keep getting and one of my dumb guys stood on it, so thats an example of how real this game can be. \n\nRecommended go get it and make some amazing stories.", "timestamp_created": 1692995737, "timestamp_updated": 1692995737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144892255": {"recommendationid": "144892255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198824559098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 7007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2364, "last_played": 1694309698}, "language": "english", "review": "awef sqwe", "timestamp_created": 1692840784, "timestamp_updated": 1692840784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144604554": {"recommendationid": "144604554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295274818", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8235, "last_played": 1695170337}, "language": "english", "review": "Our Glorious Comrade Stalin is proud of the loyalty to the party and people we display on planets untouched by his wisdom", "timestamp_created": 1692492562, "timestamp_updated": 1692492562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144226775": {"recommendationid": "144226775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031755642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 13193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 148, "playtime_at_review": 11290, "last_played": 1695528889}, "language": "english", "review": "Missing a head caused Bilgeboy to die", "timestamp_created": 1692067120, "timestamp_updated": 1692067120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144061450": {"recommendationid": "144061450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819915455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1367, "last_played": 1692059974}, "language": "english", "review": "So far my organ harvesting empire is going swimmingly.

decision-making. Set in a procedurally generated world, this unique game offers a relentless experience where you guide a group of survivors through various challenges, unpredictable events, and the ultimate goal of building a thriving colony.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of RimWorld is where it truly shines.

As their leader, you must provide shelter, food, and security while managing their emotional needs. From constructing buildings and growing crops to hunting wildlife and researching advanced technologies, every decision affects your colony's survival.\n\nOne of the game's core elements is the complex AI storyteller, which generates events and crises based on the overall situation.

This dynamic storytelling feature ensures that each playthrough feels unique and challenging, making every decision and resource allocation critical.\n\nThe depth of RimWorld's mechanics is remarkable.

The game's detailed combat system adds another layer of complexity, allowing you to set up traps, engage in tactical battles, and defend your colony from outside threats.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nWhile RimWorld's graphics are not visually stunning, they adopt a charming pixel art style that effectively conveys the game's atmosphere. The user interface is clean, intuitive, and allows easy access to all the vital information you need to manage your colony. The sound design is minimalistic yet effective, with ambient soundscapes and occasional music that create a tense and immersive atmosphere.\n\nModding Community:\nRimWorld benefits immensely from its passionate modding community. The Steam Workshop integration allows players to browse and install a vast array of mods that can significantly enhance gameplay, add new content, and tailor the experience to their liking. From quality-of-life improvements to complete overhauls, the modding scene ensures that RimWorld never feels stale, extending its replay value indefinitely.\n\nReplay Value:\nSpeaking of replay value, RimWorld excels in providing endless possibilities. With multiple biomes, different AI storytellers, and various starting scenarios, each playthrough presents new challenges and opportunities. The game's permadeath feature adds tension, making every decision and loss impactful. Whether you're aiming to build a utopian society, embrace cannibalism for survival, or experiment with futuristic technology, RimWorld accommodates a wide range of playstyles and encourages creativity.\n\nConclusion:\nRimWorld is a masterpiece of simulation and strategy, offering an addictive and rewarding experience for those willing to immerse themselves in its complex world. With its challenging gameplay, emergent storytelling, and the endless possibilities offered by its modding community, RimWorld stands as a testament to the power of indie game development.

Because there were so many prisoners, all of whom were very unhappy with their treatment, there were frequent riots and escape attempts.

The premise of the game is that it's a \"story generator\" with different storytellers. Each has their own style (read: difficulty curve). Additionally, their difficulty settings can be set from a number of different options. You can pick anywhere from \"I'm playing just to take it easy\", \"Crush my soul into splinters\", and the whole gamut between. You can customize most anything you'd like about resources, difficulty, colonists, world seed, and more at the very start. After that, pick your starting tile and then best of luck surviving.\n\nThat's a looooong preface namely to describe what makes Rimworld so fun. Such varied, granular customization at the beginning lets you pick so many options for how you want to play. Want an easy, relaxed game of building your isometric dream home? Sure! Want a run with combat, death, struggle, and disease? Absolutely! Try out the nomadic lifestyle humanity started out as? Go ahead! Even if the amount of control you have over the world is lessened after you pick the settings, you can still adjust difficulty and the storyteller (difficulty curve) anytime you like.\n\nAfter starting, you won't have as much control. You'll have to learn the mechanics and find new recruits (if you want), warts and all. Farming, hunting, ranching, researching, trading, etc. From keeping people alive on rice to cooking food fit for a king. I'll not go into all kinds of mechanics here, but needless to say even the same seed, same start, and same colonists can have radically different, interesting runs on the same settings based on player choices.\n\nOverall, I've got mostly positive experiences with this game. It's a fun time playing around with the different options, starting different colonies, and more. The game has a nice enough soundtrack you may listen to if desired, or simply put your own music on in the background. Sound effects are pleasing and distinct enough to know what's what. Notifications are (mostly) timely and helpful. The graphics aren't state-of-the-art, but have their own charm if you're a fan of the 2D, simple style the game has. Speed options keep things moving for you so you're not waiting forever for that one chef to make your meal. Even giving the player the reigns, quests, raids, and more pop up to keep things interesting and break up the monotony and provide a modicum of structure. You decide how long the game should go on. Build up, abandon the colony, and make your way to the hidden ship? Build your own ship? Don't stop and live forever on the rim? Your choice.\n\nNegatively speaking, while the game's soundtrack is wonderful, listening to the same few songs on end is exhausting. Some colonist traits are simply too severe to risk, which does limit options. Gourmand and Pyromaniac colonists are too destructive in a game where resources are not only your currency, but lifeblood. You'll need to arrest them often, beat them down, both, or sometimes end up killing them if you want to avoid massive resource drain whenever they have their destructive moods. Melee is significantly inferior to ranged. By even the mid-game, you'll be wanting people with guns for hunting and fighting. I'm at less risk of losing a limb in a scuffle or firefight with a decent enough revolver than I am with a blade that could match Excalibur, even when armored. Resource sprawl can get out of control. Gaining wealth means more people want to steal from you and notice you, but as you accrue resources, it gets harder to take you down. You'll either fizzle out or just snowball into an unstoppable juggernaut without micromanaging your wealth to avoid either. Also, why no artificial noses? I can build bionic arms, legs, hearts, and more...but I can't make a fake nose if someone's is broken?\n\nThis is an ideal game for those looking for a colony sim that's a nice balance between mechanical, roleplay (whether or not you yourself opt into it), and random. It's never unapproachable, offers endless hours of random fun, and options. If you need something more mathematical, thematic, or structured, games like Oxygen Not Included, Frostpunk, or Surviving Mars may be what you want instead.\n\nTL;DR: Iz gud gayme.

"english", "review": "This game will suck your soul right out of your body and give it to me. I accidentally sat up 5 hours past my bedtime because I couldn't let it go.\n\nRimWorld is hands down one of the most enjoyable and addictive games I've ever played. It's all about building and managing a colony, and let me tell you, it's so much fun! The mechanics are deep and there's always something to do, whether it's building new structures, training your colonists, or dealing with random events that pop up. And the best part is, every time you play, the game generates a new world so it's never the same experience twice.\n\nOne of the things I love most about RimWorld is the AI storyteller system. It basically controls the pace and direction of the game, and it keeps things interesting by throwing curveballs at you when you least expect it. One moment, you'll be cruising along, and the next, you'll have a massive raid on your hands.

The developers of DF have been working for like 20 years to make a graphic representation of the original that's accessible enough for new players to get into it without feeling like they're learning another language. Rimworld also has a LOT of complexity, but it's introduced in such a way that anyone can pick it up and start their empire. Plus, it's got robots and bionic arms and guns and space ships. A great game, if you like building an empire like I do you'll like this game.

The devs are really responsive. Every other review that tells a story of a crazy emergent gameplay scenario, intense raid or just praising the gameplay are all right, so I wont add any of that here. Plus I used to have a positive review with my own such story, that I removed after the 2nd DLC came out. \n\nBut its time for me to make a point. \n\nThis review has to do with the DLC policy they have been trending with. Royalty was $20 (USD), Ideology was $20, and now Biotech is $25. The DLCs are roughly twice price of the base game. This is beginning to border on greed. \n\nIn addition, the DLCs seem to take a lot from existing mods, then they rewrap it some and sell it back to us. Not to mention that these DLCs come with major version updates that invariably break many mods, and some of those mods never come back, sort of reducing the total customize-ability of the game and reducing the content threshold for about the same amount that the DLC adds. I understand that there are mods for basically anything in rimworld and that the devs adding new features would likely step on someone's toes, but adding a DLC that just does something that mods already do is... questionable. Add in the rising price and the fact that the base game is now about 0.52 the value of the DLCs themselves, and I've had enough. \n\nTo be fair the concent alone wasn't really an issue with the first two DLCs, which seemed to try to do something that mods werent QUITE doing yet. but this is also the THIRD one, is 20% more than the other ones, and just takes mods or mod ideas already out there and makes them 'official' by reselling them to us, \n\nFor the first time, I am not buying this DLC. The rest were basically auto buys. But no longer. \n\nI would like to see if the devs address the concerns of the community in a meaningful way before getting this and I hope those who agree follow suit for now. They've always been adaptable and responsive, I'll wait to see it in action again. Maybe we are wrong, maybe they are, all I know is that we all make mistakes and fixing them should be priority once identified.", "timestamp_created": 1666449472, "timestamp_updated": 1666449472, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520167291164398193", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1666459048, "developer_response": "Hi there eden,\n\nRegarding price, here's what I wrote about this in the last Biotech preview:\n\n\"Biotech will be priced slightly differently from our previous expansions, at $24.99 USD. (Other territories have different prices on Steam.) We hired a lot of people and took a lot of time (15 months) to make Biotech because that\u2019s what it took to properly explore the ideas that we set out to explore. The feature set got big enough that we seriously discussed splitting this into two expansions, but decided to keep it as one.\n\nSome companies have a \u201ccost first\u201d model where they decide up front to make an expansion in a fixed time/price (e.g. 6 months/$20) and force the creative process to live in those constraints. We take ideas and build them until they feel well-rounded and complete. We believe that different ideas naturally take different amounts of resources to explore, so it must be okay for different expansions to have different prices, for the same reason different games have different prices. Forcing every expansion to have the same price would mean trying to squeeze or stretch every idea into the same amount of production resources, which is not a path to creative flourishing. That\u2019s why our expansions aren\u2019t all priced the same - because they\u2019re different in scope, because that\u2019s what the ideas wanted.\"\n\nRegarding mods - There are over 17,000 mods for RimWorld on the Steam workshop. Many of them are based on ideas from my fiction that I wrote way back in 2012, before RimWorld was even announced, and which I published as the \"RimWorld fiction primer\". Many others are based on ideas that are simply natural and obvious - children, mechanoid control, etc.\n\nWe don't go around looking at mods to take anything from them; I don't pay much attention to them at all. Certainly we don't take assets from them, and we implement everything ourselves.\n\nHowever, please understand that there are only a certain number of natural ways to add to this game. With 17,000 mods, basically all of those have been done, often several times. If we were trying to treat the 17,000 mods as a minefield where we can't touch something that someone else did some version of, it would simply be impossible for us to add anything. Oftentimes a similar mod comes out after we start development of the expansion, too.\n\nI'm afraid these kinds of criticisms are a major reason many devs work to stifle modding, or just don't support it. We've done everything we could to support modding the game, and the result is that there are 17,000 mods - and then when we try to add anything ourselves we get attacked for any overlaps that may exist.\n\nIt's a punishment for helping the mod community flourish, and for not abandoning the game. I don't feel these are really behaviors you want to punish in game developers. This negative review would never exist if we blocked mods like so many do, or abandoned the game like so many others. Please consider the position we're in, whether we really did something wrong, and what you're really pushing devs to do - either abandon games or stifle mods.\n\nPlease also consider that this is a review for RimWorld, which is not a worse game today than it was a week ago. In fact, it's better, since the 1.4 update improves a pile of stuff and adds free content.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to not buy an expansion - not every product is for every player. But does the fact that we're trying to make new stuff (that people like - Biotech has 96% rating) make RimWorld a bad game, or make us bad devs? I hope you'll reconsider this review. Because I don't want to block mods and I don't want to abandon the game.\n\nThanks for writing in any case."}, "128187868": {"recommendationid": "128187868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103630611",

I originally got Rimworld for free during the 2020/21 lockdown.. I was broke, board and looking for something to fill in those extra hours at home.  I thought I'd play a few hours here and there.. next thing I know the lockdown was lifted,  fights opened and work was back on the table.  I probably clocked up around 1000 hours.. the diversity and replayability was endless.. from the casual story lines to the hectic God Randy making your life hell.. from watching your pawns construct your colony to activating dev mode and building crazy colonies, and even after so much play time your still discovering new aspects.   The base game is amazing, and the expansions just brought those little things you didn't know you needed, not to mention the community workshop mods bringing pretty much additional expansions.   This game gives everything you want for its genre,  can it be improved.. sure.. what gamer would not appreciate improvements.. does it need it.. not really.  The main thing is after so much play time, for free, once the option presented itself, I didn't hesitate to purchase the game with all current DLC to support Tynan and his team as Im sure the game will continue to expand and grow, the community is very strong and the future is yet to be written.. Do I recommend this game.. yes 100%..

She survived but with permanent brain damage. Fortunately (?) the person who shot her survived, became an involuntary lung donor for another colonists asthmatic lungs. Sent him on his way as a lesson to the hostile Outlanders he came from.\n\nMeanwhile, I had not realized that our colony had 6 people, with only one male and the rest being female.  The man of the colony was apparently loving this arrangement, quite literally as he had not one, not two, but three lovers in the colony.  Oh, did I mention he\u2019s also married?  Well, the dear old wife comes in a raid.  I can only assume this has to do with her husband\u2019s infidelity, though she is also with the faction with our lung donor.  Anyway, they come for vengeance and are driven off, with our poor brain damaged colonist trading favors by putting one through the forehead of our patriarch\u2019s wife. \n\nHe is devastated.  You can tell, because he waited a full day after burying his wife to propose to one of his lover (the now former asthmatic thanks to another organ donation from the raid.  Maybe they\u2019ll learn their lesson this time).\n\nBut our story does not end there.  We are now up to our patriarch and 7 women.  Not a single other man.  He gets married, then cheats on his wife and re-marries.  It\u2019s is the most dysfunctional relationship cycle I have seen, and I\u2019m a counselor.\n\nThen our poor brain damaged colonist gets the plague.  Unfortunately she does not survive and there is much sorrow throughout the colony.  Injuries have spread, with our patriarch missing a thumb and having a mangled eye, asthmatic having a painful scar on her leg, and a myriad of others.  So, we did what any right thinking person would do, and began replacing limbs and eyes with bionics.  Also, since harvesting organs as a warning isn\u2019t working, we\u2019ve change tactics to sending them all our excess puppies, because who doesn\u2019t love puppies right?  It seems to be working, and peace is within our grasp.\n\nNow our colony of cyborgs has its eyes set on the stars.\n\n10/10  Would get involved in dysfunction web of relationships and commit crimes against humanity again.

After giving this game a bit of slack, I discovered just how deep it truly was.\n\nAs far as gameplay is concerned, Rimworld forms itself upon the foundation of the aforementioned colony survival simulator archetype. Though what Rimworld truly is, at its core, is a story-building game. It's a game of hardship, tragedy, despair, and acceptance. It is possible to save-scum in this game, but you're missing out on 4/5ths of the actual experience this game has to offer. Colonists develop complex relationships, crops get botched on harvest by inexperienced farmers, and buildings burn down and debilitate your whole colony for the rest of the year. Rimworld offers not just a story of rugged survival, but of incredible stress and the consequences of hopelessness as well. Watch colonists die, witness disgustingly selfish atrocities take place, and dig your way back up out of the ashes to make something new from what you've lost. There are few scenarios in Rimworld from which your colony cannot truly recover from, and almost nothing you can lose that you cannot recoup or reclaim. And if all else fails? If the final chapter of your long story comes to a close? Then you have something to hold on to as you write a new tale. Embrace the chaos and uncertainty of a hostile world as you not only endure hardships, but eventually come to thrive in spite of them.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nI could only describe this game as an [i]everything[/i] simulator.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I can no longer recommend it. Releasing DLC was one thing- you gotta make money to keep developing, whatever. But lately, Ludeon's been completely brazen about taking possession of mod content created by the community and then re-releasing it as DLC. That's just immoral. Unethical. Somehow you managed to make a model for modded content worse than Bethesda's. I cannot support a company that would take their modders for granted like that, and I'll be damned if I pay money for DLC that renders free mods I previously enjoyed obsolete.\n\nEdit: You're a liar. You've literally taken art assets and mechanics directly from mods I played before you published the DLC. Your EULA specifically states that you reserve the right to redistribute and sell user-created content, specifically including mods, without attribution.

We develop everything ourselves.\n\nOur actual mod mechanics and content are all 100% original; if you look into any of the details you'll see the dramatic differences between any mod and our DLCs in terms of what they actually do.\n\nThere are 10,000 mods for RimWorld on the Steam workshop, so of course there will be some general conceptual overlap between anything we do and a mod that has existed. With 10,000 mods, everything has been touched on by modders in some way.\n\nWe can't treat 10,000 mods like a minefield where we're not allowed to touch any related idea. Things like xenohumans, vampires, and children are extremely obvious and natural ways to expand the game. (In fact, xenohumans are my concept from my own fiction doc that I wrote in 2013; modders took it from there). There are only so many general conceptual ways to expand the game.\n\nSome conceptual overlap is completely unavoidable and the only way to prevent it would be to block modding. Accusations like this are a major reason that big studios block modding; we don't want to do that. We want to support modding so please help us do that.\n\nI hope you'll consider investigating whether this accusation is actually true and, if it's not, I hope you'll remove this review.\n\nThanks for enjoying the game in any case; I'm proud to have made a game you've loved for 5,800 hours (wow!)\nCheers\n-Ty\n\nPS: the Ludeon FAQ addresses this as well https://ludeon.com/blog/faq/"}, "133648053": {"recommendationid": "133648053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176985174", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2802, "last_played": 1682664878}, "language": "english", "review": "\u591a\u4eba\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1677399743, "timestamp_updated": 1677399743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516908168792724609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133277300": {"recommendationid": "133277300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008060059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7216, "last_played": 1681338324}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyable and the hours fly by while playing this.

We haven't had sex since August, and we probably won't anytime soon. The phone calls and texts of concerned friends have gone unanswered. After ignoring his eighth invitation to family dinner, my father has struck my name from the family will and I barely noticed. I didn't really want his library of computer guides from the 1980's anyway, so I don't see what the big deal is.\n\nBottom line- I've created my own personal hell that I know deep down I will never escape, and part of me doesn't even want to.

Your colonists are covered in burns but the menace is gone\n\nStep 13: realise some exotic traders will buy boomrats and you could have just sold them all for roughly 3k silver\nStep 14: cry\nStep 15: start a Warg breeding program\n\n10/10, I've never felt more like a colonist than I did trying to fix an environment that I ruined myself through my own stupidity.

Through my undergraduate studies, through the first few years of my career, through breakups and new love, through moves across the world and other massive life developments. Whenever I get the \"itch\" to boot up Rimworld it quickly snowballs into ignoring friends, lovers, and family. I've skipped classes, made up false plans to friends, lied to my employers, and even postponed eating and working out to continue to enjoy life on the Rim. It is the great escape from everything. Endless combinations of mods and scenarios to pursue, it is the ultimate sandbox to act on every desire  from deranged fantasies to morbid curiosities. As I type this, coming off a month long binge, I long for the mental sctratch of a new mod or new DLC to drop so I can return to where I belong.

Now I will say that I wouldn't have spent as much time on the game if mods weren't here, but there are very many mods to ensure that gameplay is fun and new every single playthrough. The modding scene is insane and the modders themselves must be mechs with how quickly they update and add to the game. Even without mods the base game can be fun. The dlcs add a significant amount to the game and I'd struggle to play the game without them now. The prices could seem a bit high, but I think it's well worth it for the amount of time someone can spend just going through dlc mechanics. This is probably one of the best games I stumbled upon and I'm thankful I had a chance to find it and enjoy it.

Talk about bad timing, though. Their formidable muscle, Shiigen, was still recovering in the hospital from a previous assault. However, Collins, known as \"the Boss\", the group's capable doctor, fearlessly assumed command on the frontlines.\n\nThe raiders aimed to breach the vulnerable northern wall, providing them easy access to the undefended farm. This was a dire situation indeed. The colony's chef, Boone, and skilled architect, Banksy, a couple who had by now seen some shit, swiftly positioned themselves near the barn entrance, located southwest of the wall breach. Meanwhile, Cain, a child who had recently stumbled upon the colony, was given shelter within the barn. As the last line of defense, the group's loyal guard dogs\u2014Abel, Dogmeat, and Stanley (two German shepherds and a pug, respectively)\u2014guarded the entrance by Cain.\n\nWith Collins, Boone, and Banksy prepared for the impending onslaught, they braced themselves for the force of approximately ten well-armed raiders. Suddenly, the wall gave way, and Banksy unleashed a torrent of fire from her trusty chain shotgun, immediately dispatching the intruder.\n\nThe following trio of raiders swiftly sought cover by the farm fence, engaging in a fierce firefight. Unfortunately, Collins took a hit to the chest, though her trusty flak vest mitigated the worst of the damage. Regrettably, she fell to the ground, incapacitated.\n\nBoone, relying on his trusty revolver, engaged in a fiery exchange with a raider wielding a short bow. However, it was the raider with the axe who seized the opportunity, swiftly cleaving Boone's hand and bringing him down.\n\nAs Banksy took aim at the raider who had just felled Boone, her shot narrowly missed. Engaging in a desperate struggle, she eventually struck the raider in the nose with her rifle, rendering them helpless. However, Banksy's guard faltered as an unseen sniper from the breached wall shot off her arm. She joined Boone on the ground, wounded and bleeding out.\n\nRecognizing that they had incurred heavy losses themselves, the raiders decided to retreat, kidnapping any survivors in their path as they made their hasty exit through the breached wall. Just as they thought they had made a clean getaway, a raider carrying Banksy unexpectedly met a brutal end, a swift blow from an axe to the head. The raider beside them tried to flee but found their left leg chopped off by another axe strike, removing them from the fight.\n\nI was already planning how the hell I was going to assemble a rescue mission when out of left fucking field, Shiigen, the heavy sleeper who had been unresponsive in the hospital, had finally emerged. Being high as a kite on smoke leaf and hungry, he had woken up to indulge in some food and a big fatty before catching wind of the ongoing battle and racing to the scene.\n\nDespite two colonists still being carried away by the raiders and Banksy\u2019s life hanging in the balance, Shiigen called out to Cain, urging them to emerge from the safety of the barn with the loyal dogs. Cain rushed to administer crucial first aid to Banksy (a highly recommended mod for situations like these).\n\nStumbling, his high ass barely registering friend from tree, Shiigen confronted the remaining kidnappers in a valiant effort to halt their escape. Alas, it seemed his actions alone would not suffice. Thankfully, Stanley the pug, hot on Shiigen's trail, delivered a courageous bite that staggered the nearest raider. Tragically, Stanley's heroism proved fatal, as they were struck down while protecting Boone. The fleeing raider attempted to escape, but Abel, the German Shepard, swiftly tore them apart, delivering immediate justice for Stanley.\n\nFinally, the raider carrying Collins, the colony's esteemed doctor and sole hope for healing lost limbs, was on the verge of leaving the map. Not wanting to miss out on the action, Dogmeat, the other German Shepard, lunged forward, bringing down the final raider, while Shiigen approached to deliver the finishing blow with his axe.\n\nWhen the dust settled and the battle was won, my valiant colonists required urgent triage, having suffered the loss of one hand, two legs, one arm, and even one big toe among the three victims.\n\nWords cannot adequately convey the torrent of emotions that surged through me when that idiot Shiigen stumbled upon the scene. Trust me, just buy the game. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. You'll embark on retaliatory strikes with overwhelming force against lesser colonies within a single season.

While it takes heavy inspiration from Dwarf Fortress, Tynan Sylvester has implemented one of the more complex methods of storytelling in the form of AI storytellers that all control in-game events in unique ways. The complexity of the built-in mechanics warrant their own separate post as I could easily sit here for days discussing aspects such as: temperature, accuracy, skills, colony management, etc. \n\nFor any newcomers just picking up the game, DO NOT buy the DLC until you've completed the tutorial and have spent a few hours learning some of the basics of colony management. Each DLC package - aside from Royalty - completely change several core mechanics of the game while simultaneously making gameplay much harder unless you already have a foundational level of understanding of how the game and the AI storytellers operate. You WILL get slaughtered, several times over, if you decide to go in blind.\n\nRegarding DLC: Biotech and Ideology have taken the core mechanics of the game and introduced concepts which could be entirely separate games in their own right. The additions and changes to core Rimworld mechanics results in a near infinite number of mostly unique scenarios to play through, and each story can often last for several real time days (my longest running colony lasted for 1 full week, or 128 hours of my total playtime). Royalty is the only DLC that you could easily skip and not miss out on much of anything (psycasts were added by mods well before the DLC was created).\n\n\n\nDespite recommending others purchase the game I feel obligated to note that the primary reason for Rimworld continuing to dominate the Steam top rate games (currently sitting at #8 as of 9/16/2023) is due to the vast modding community who continually develop and release full size DLC for free. Similar to games like Factorio and Skyrim, modders have provided extensive bug fixes to the game, introduced completely unique game mechanics, and have vastly expanded upon already existing content,

continually fresh experience. You can do one play through as ultra nice compassionate colonists who help passers-by, who treat their injured enemies and release them or recruit them when healed, you can play as cannibal murderers who only consume the flesh of man and like to decorate their camp with skulls, you can even play as cavemen who slowly but surely build their tech up until they can create laser weapons and edit their DNA to make them super soldiers etc.\n\nWhen you get tired of one play style there are dozens more to choose from, and with the mod scene as active as it is there are countless new things to discover and try out on a weekly basis.\n\nIt's great for role playing, its great for challenges, it's great for sitting back and just making a nice little colony.\n\nThat and it tuns on anything, My 1080 burned out a few weeks ago and I head to resort to using my old 970 card and Rimworld ran perfectly fine.\n\nIt is also regularly supported with DLC which while a bit pricey, does add a ton of stuff

I've almost exclusively played this on Steam Deck and I'd dare say it is one of the best games out there to showcase the Deck. It draws little power, so the battery lasts forever, yet feels immense and completely immersive. \nThe premise is simple - survive. Take your 3 little escape pod people and help them survive, give them tasks, collect metal, mine ores, build a little base and hope for the best. The game's tutorial is smooth as it leads you through the game's mechanics and game loop, but it doesn't expose all the secrets (which is the best part). \n\nThe more you play the more game seems to let slip little tidbits of what you can do and the strange feeling of 'life' within this world you have landed on.

That was the game... breeding sheep and shearing their wool. Constantly. I have no idea if this is the actual game, but its the game I'm playing. Space Sheep. Cougar got into the sheep's little fenced off part of the world once... it sat there for a day, doing nothing. Then it attacked. I should have killed it. I wasn't going to make that mistake again. So I built spike traps around the outside of the fence. Nothing gets in now without get a spike trap around the head. \n\nEven THE PLAGUE can't kill off these sheep. \n\nBasically, RimWorld is a vast sandbox where there's a lot to do, but I've ignored it all to be a Space Sheep farmer. \n\nResearch new things? Nah, I'll just look after me sheep.\n\nGo exploring? Nah. Sheep. \n\nMaybe go on some of those random quests that pop up to gain new space tech and loot? Nope. No need for that, I've got me sheep. \n\nThere's probably so much more to RimWorld that I haven't really experienced yet, but the 26.8 hours I've spent so far making this Space Sheep farm has been a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1667919817, "timestamp_updated": 1667920012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504504501819610596", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144747944": {"recommendationid": "144747944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137350665", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 22894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22894, "last_played": 1692592325}, "language": "english", "review": "When you first start playing, every setback feels terrible.

Because Rimworld is a game that you'd love to play, but you almost NEVER CAN! \n\nBetween greedy developers pursuing the Paradox model of endless overpriced DLC:s and near constant updates breaking the game and every other mod, and between the modders themselves, with some moron pushing an unneccessary update to a framework mod breaking hundreds of mods in the process, or someone promising to update \"soon\" only for months and months to go by without the essential mod ever getting updated - you'll be lucky to play a few days at a time until it inevitably breaks again, and again, AND AGAIN! \n\nIt takes me 40 minutes to load and start the damn game (the modded experience), imagine how many times I've loaded up the game, only for it to be arbitrarily broken, either at the hands of the devs or some modder, completely ruining my evening, and you can probably deduct about 700+ hours of my game time, because most of it was spent WAITING! OFTEN IN VAIN!\n\nBut that's just the shitty steam workshop experience isn't it, well that's the thing, Rimworld without mods isn't very appealing at all, it's boring, bland and broken in ways that only mods will remedy, heck I used to have a mod specifically just to change the power consumption of light bulbs! That's all it did! It took them literal years to put that change into the base game! \n\nAnd if I wanted to have to download mods from some external site, I might as well not have bothered with steam. Alternatively, one option would be; download the mods from steam and then move them over to the mod folder just so they won't update and break everything, except the folders are named with nothing but randomly assigned numbers making that a tremendous hassle that I just can't be bothered with, and every update introduces twice as many bugs as they fix, breaking everything anyways, and then you can't download new mods because those are now built around those updates!\n\nThey've also recently introduced a bug requiring you to constantly validate your files, that they won't even acknowledge exists, so that's even more time wasted! Over an hour total's worth of time, just to find out; IT'S BROKEN AGAIN! I have spent entire evenings; validating, starting, fiddling with mod lists, restarting, fiddling with mod lists, restarting, never getting to actually play the game that I want to play. As you can imagine, this rant is the result of one such fruitless evening too many.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the single core processing, that it's built in Unity or that it eats memory for breakfast, lunch and dinner to the point that even after you've turned it off after playing for a few hours, you notice a considerable slowdown.\n\nWith every DLC released, it just gets worse and worse. He's going to run this game into the ground, until it's an unplayable mess, mark my words. If this game is to remain good, then just leave it alone! Let the community fix what needs fixing and above all...\n\nStop. BREAKING. MY. DAMN.

time in the game is closer to double what's displayed on my profile, and you want to know what it has taught me?\nThis developer absolutely HATES the people who mod his game for free. He's never stated this, but his actions with the development of his game seem to differ...\nI remember playing this game when it was still in early access, and being infinitely irritated every time a new update came out. Now why would I be mad about updates? Because for people who mod this game, and I'm one of the many who finds this game unplayable without mods, each update breaks every single mod you have installed, because the mods are rendered functionless until the author updates them to the current build. This acted like a sifter, each updates filtering out more and more flavor mods, because the author assumingly got frustrated and abandoned the mod.\nWhen the 1.0 stable build came out, it was a golden age for modding.... Every mod was now perpetually valid as long as it didn't conflict with others you had running. Finally you could reliably run your favorite, personally flavored heavy-mod builds and invest untold hours into them knowing the game will finally have the depth that its potential allows. No more miles-wide ocean that only goes skin-deep (the problem that invariably plagues vanilla rimworld).... This was when I loved the game.\nThen Tynan released the Royalty DLC.... This brought an end to the golden age of modding, ruined all my saves where I had invested countless hours into nurturing that stupid little colony through every hardship the game could throw at me. I was pissed enough to drop the game for the mean-time.\nYears later I come back thinking it should now be on a stable build with biotech having been released months ago (how many more DLC's can Tynan really fart out? This isn't Paradox Interactive.... right?) Now a week later after getting a good mod list together and giving the game another go.... Ludeon releases ANOTHER piddly little update adding almost nothing to the game, and it breaks all of my saves and my entire mod list. Now it refuses to load my earlier saved mod-list, and keeps all of my 88 or so mods in a constant state of \"now downloading\"...\nI believe I've found the fix through a pinned discussion link, but after dropping $25 on that damned Biotech DLC, I have absolutely no desire to spend another 2-4 hours just trying to resurrect my saves when Ludeon will just break them all again a month or 2 from now when they release the next piddling update.\nLudeon/Tynan, you are ruining your games by actively discouraging the mod base... the only actual life and soul behind the game you created...

colony on an alien planet. Rimworld has some pretty good graphics for a top-down colony sim, they're unique and leave the game easy on the eyes for continuous play.\n\nRimworld has an interesting relationship with its resource management. While it does provide a satisfying processing cycle for crafting items and gathering resources, the scarcity element entirely goes out the window once certain requirements are met. This leads to my believing that the game is intended to go from a 'survival of basics' (food, cover, medicine) to a 'survival of malice' (where pretty much the only threats are heavy disease and raids, which scale up in unfairness.).\n\nThe game's Steam Workshop is a highlight, with a thriving community of modders creating new content and expanding on the game's core mechanics. This adds a wealth of new options and customization to the game, with plenty of mods adding tons of new content, storytellers, etc. However, Rimworld's position as a 'story generator' usually doesn't amount to anything. While the game's basic survival formula is engaging and challenging, the story system rarely produces anything noteworthy outside of this formula. Without player intervention, most games will go extremely similar, with very few notable events or storylines emerging.\n\nDespite the general repetitiveness of its gameplay, Rimworld remains a standout survival game that offers satisfying resource management gameplay. With its active Steam Workshop community, the game offers a wealth of options and customization that allow players to tailor their experience to their liking. If you're looking for a challenging survival game, Rimworld is an excellent choice, just don't expect the game's story system to provide much variety or surprise.

Rimworld's a story generator, so I thought I'd share my story. I bought rimworld around two weeks prior to writing this, and set up a small colony. The first animal my colonists tamed was a 212 year old tortoise, who I named \"Old Timer.\" We set up a small farm, and once we found a female tortoise (who I named \"Henrietta Peach\"), they had kids. And their kids had kids. Soon enough, I had too many tortoises than I knew what to do with, so i tried selling them, and the nearby colonists loved them. But things took a darker turn.\n\nAround 5 days after buying rimworld, my IRL dog, of 15 years, passed. It was sad, but what hit extra hard was old timer's death only a few hours later. Both were blind, both had bad backs - it hurt, and I cried. I dug a big tomb in a mountain for old timer, and laid him to rest in it. But this is not where his story ends.\n\nA few ingame hours later, I got a quest with a ressurection serum as a reward. In that moment, I knew what I had to do, as the end goal of my playthrough.\n\nI couldn't save my dog from old age, but I sure as could save this turtle. Old timer was going to space.\n\nAfter quickly gunning down some tribals and getting the serum, I needed a way to keep old timer from dying all over again while I aquired the supplies for the ship. Luckily, an ancient ruin was on my map, and after an intense fight with some killer robots, I safely placed him in a stasis chamber the robots were guarding.\n\nNot much happened relating to him. Henrietta died of old age herself, and over the four or so years it took me to complete the ship, old timer's children numbered over 500. i made regular trips to the nearby towns to trade tortoises for the ship's supplies, like plasteel and uranium, and at long last, I placed old timer in the now-finished ship and turned the reactor on.\n\nWhen you power on the escape reactor, rimworld basically becomes a sort of wave defense game, with a new posse of enemies coming every day for 15 days or so while the reactor charged. This wasn't a big deal - I had troops in power armor with miniguns, and we made it to the end of the 15 days without any deaths. Right as the reactor was at full power, and I told my colonists to enter the ship, things took a dramatic turn. A solar flare knocked out all my defences, leaving me without any kind of fire support. I hurredly got my colonists in the ship, but right as the last one was making his way across the fields to get to it...\n\nPirates airdropped into my base. I was screwed.\n\nI was about to launch without him, when salvation came in a way I hadn't expected: A tortoise (number 493, to be precise) didn't take too kindly to someone coming out of the sky and attempting to shoot his keepers, and bit a pirate enforcer on the leg. This caused the pirate to hit him with his club, and after that the OTHER pirates started shooting the hundred or so turtles in the base, who promptly attacked back. And, in the ensuing chaos, my last colonist boarded the ship and we escaped.\n\nOld timer, a blind, crippled, undead tortoise repaid me for saving his life - by birthing countless decendants to not only fund my escape, but who also protected me in my darkest hour of need. This game is a gift, and I cannot reccommend it enough. Even if you reload saves to keep the story going how you want, it's still a story worth telling.\n\n10/10: The first game to make me cry.\n", "timestamp_created": 1632977089, "timestamp_updated": 1632977089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1724, "votes_funny": 213, "weighted_vote_score": "0.987842917442321777", "comment_count": 51, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107411409": {"recommendationid": "107411409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985188017", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 172776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1004, "playtime_at_review": 70598, "last_played": 1696132655}, "language": "english", "review": "My wife doesn't like or play video games.

The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans.\nNow and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours.\n\nAs if ...\n\nRemember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz.\nThe harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way.\n\n[i] But then came the tortoise.\t[/i]\n\nWaltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise. [b] Nope!\t[/b] I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest.\nAt last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him. Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on.\nBut apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again.\nWhile she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both. Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement.\nIn the end it was all too much.\nTali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries. Rain started falling down, putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first, Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end.\nTraumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it. So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked. With the solar panels a loss to the flames, the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath.\n\n\n12 / 10 - Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs; looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ...).\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far :-)", "timestamp_created": 1484728785, "timestamp_updated": 1484729311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 891, "votes_funny": 274, "weighted_vote_score": "0.9724845290184021", "comment_count": 51, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62869755": {"recommendationid": "62869755", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964234833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 12655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12184, "last_played": 1584499593}, "language": "english", "review": "I still get misty when I remember my pet raccoon Willy.

All was well- until a band of savages laid siege to my settlement. I barely survived- but resolved to increase my security, installing several auto-turrets around my perimeter. This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time, but I needed a longer term solution- so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements.\n\nI wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon. When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland, I did not hesitate to inspect their wares. I wanted a slave, but not just any slave- he should be foreboding, brutal and utterly without mercy! And that was when I found him. His name was Skint Mcgruff. He was a feared crime lord when they captured him, infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him. I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in. I fed him (alas, not the human meat he desired, but nutrient paste, made from potatoes- poor fare, but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him.\n\nBy now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form, and so I presented the idea to him the very next day. He was keen- particularly about the notion of having retractable claws- and so the work began. My medical droid handled most of the surgery, but I crafted the bionic components myself. It was a long and grueling process, but eventually, he was complete. More machine now than man, I felt it necessary to rename him... to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more, and thus I named him C.A.N.N.I.B.A.L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs). He is my pride and joy... bionic eyes that can see even in the dark, bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah, and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes, and of course, I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward.\n\nNow, I can finally conduct my research in peace...", "timestamp_created": 1496531728, "timestamp_updated": 1585424654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2214, "votes_funny": 468, "weighted_vote_score": "0.970357120037078857", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95959161": {"recommendationid": "95959161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050500558", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 15735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14357, "last_played": 1688115504}, "language": "english", "review": "Nine cats wandered into my colony and I was happy\n\nThe cats ate through my colony's food so quickly that everyone started starving and I was worried\n\nI killed, skinned, and cooked eight of the cats to survive out of desperation and I was sad\n\nThe one cat I kept started eating the cat meat on the floor and I was mortified\n\nOne of my colonists got too stressed and started smashing stuff, causing a fire that killed the final cat and I was angry\n\nI stripped the colonist naked and banished him to the forest as punishment where he was captured by slave traders and I felt nothing\n\nThis game is truly an emotional rollercoaster", "timestamp_created": 1626611659, "timestamp_updated": 1626611659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1055, "votes_funny": 502, "weighted_vote_score": "0.961880624294281006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26627644": {"recommendationid": "26627644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983108308", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 37088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 719, "last_played": 1682126465}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony.

At first it's very daunting as there is a lot to get used to, but each new discovery comes with a new way to experience the game, your story is always your own and it'll never be the same as before, lending this game to nigh-infinite replayability, and that's not even considering mods which are abundant, relatively easy to make yourself and very active. The developers constantly revise and improve aspects of the game improving it more and more as time passes, even your own ideas may be implemented if they're good additions to the game. The community is one of the best I've seen, where people joke around, share their playthroughs and wacky happenings whilst generally having a good time. I recommend this game if you like strategy, tackling positive/negative turn of events, planning things, and sandbox style survival games. If you're still on the fence for buying the game, watch a 'lets play' video and see madness that can occur, check out all the mods that are available and imagine the possibilities, it really is a great game.\n\n[b]Art 8/10:[/b] The art style is quite minimalistic, at first it may be a turn-off but the style works well with the gameplay, with the attention you need to pay to so many things on screen it's good that the textures aren't complex, as it'd strain your eyes, whereas this style is soft on the eyes and doesn't impede the gameplay, things represent what they're meant to be, and it's surprisingly easy to get immersed into the game with the simplistic graphics.\n\n[b]Story 10/10:[/b] This game is both heart breaking and hilarious, there is no set story, so things can go in any direction, you could have a trader caravan arrive to sell items just as a raid occurs, causing a massively shoot out between two major groups just outside your base, after which you can mop up all their valuables and turn their corpses into meals and skin, maybe for that human leather hat you've always wanted. Perhaps you start brewing beer only to have one of your pets drink some and get addicted to alcohol. Story is incredibly well done in this game, and with how fun it can be I'm surprised lots of other games don't use the same style.\n\n[b]Sound 6/10:[/b] The sound is basic like the art, the sounds work for their intended purposes, there's nothing spectacular to talk about nor is there anything unique, the sound it has is right, but it's not something the game is well known for and isn't made to contribute a lot to the game.\n\n[b]Gameplay 8/10:[/b] There are different types of games so I'll elaborate, for the style of game this is (a sci-fi colony sim) I'd say the gameplay is near perfect, and it can be perfected to a player's liking with mods, a lot of features from popular mods are incorporated into the game over time so the base game's gameplay will get even better over time. Things are placed using the UI at the bottom of the screen, and your colonists with build them if they have the resources, they can get the resources from your setting up of work orders (like cutting down trees, mining rocks, butchering animals, harvesting plants and various other ways). It's almost like you're the architect of a colony, telling them what needs to be done and when it needs to be done, it's quite nice as luck is a big factor, but foresight allows you to somewhat control your luck, and mitigate disaster, there's little that's more satisfying than diverting misfortune with a well thought out plan.\n\n[b]Mods 9/10:[/b] Mods are very good for this game, some change the game entirely (like changing the space-cowboy style theme to that of Lord of the Rings, Medieval, WW2 era and many others), whilst others change / add to the games features and tools, allowing for you to adjust anything you don't like into something you do like, and the modding community is quite active, if there's a good idea for a mod then it's likely already made, If you choose to buy it then I recommend trying the base game without mods first, as whilst they add a lot to the game, they also take away from the main theme, playing it without mods will help you understand the fundamentals a lot quicker.\n\n[b]Overall 9/10:[/b] The features individually would make the game an 8.2/10, but how they come together makes it a 9/10 for me, since RimWorld is the best game of it's type, I've looked long and hard for other games like it, and Prison Architect is the only game similar, but to me it doesn't have the random glory that RimWorld has. RimWorld is certainly worth \u00a330, hell it's worth \u00a350+ to me since I've got so much entertainment out of it, other games you may play for 200, maybe 300 hours, but this is one of those games which you can sink months into, and games like that are worth buying.\n\nThanks for reading my review if you did, I don't often write reviews but this game is just so good that I can't help but share my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1537307186, "timestamp_updated": 1537307186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 565, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.95996248722076416", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111494789": {"recommendationid": "111494789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033496271", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 4749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3756, "last_played": 1668640465}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like having a little ant farm, but all the ants are committing war crimes.", "timestamp_created": 1646371504, "timestamp_updated": 1646371504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 436, "votes_funny": 321, "weighted_vote_score": "0.959575414657592773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54465321": {"recommendationid": "54465321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031792985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 24331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3588, "last_played": 1670971642}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing this game for the first time and I want to share the story of how I realized it's kind of amazing.\n\nThe last of my three original colonists, a female trader named Onesan, died nine years after founding the colony. The story of her life on the planet is what amazed me and it convinced me this game is something special. It actually made me a little emotional. None of what I'm going to say is fake, this all happened.\n\nOnesan arrived on the planet with her sister Min, a 16 year old K pop star, and her best friend August, a miner. Min died early on from injuries she took during a caravan ambush. Barely a year after that, August bled to death from injuries she received during a very bad pirate raid on the colony. Onesan broke down often in the early years.\n\nBy year three the only person Onesan knew well in the colony was her husband, Steel. Onesan and Steel had gone through a very rocky courtship. It took two years of awkward back and forth flirting before Steel finally won her over. But after three years of marriage, Steel was seduced by another colonist, and Onesan separated from him. Despite Steel's cheating she never broke down again. She couldn't afford to. She was the colony's lead trader and negotiator. Onesan was always busy, constantly on the road between her colony and the friendly one nearby. During the periods when she wasn't on the road, she tailored clothes for the rest of the colony. Steel stayed on his side of the colony, working on armor and weapons. \n\nFor years they rarely ran into each other despite the relatively small size of the colony. Eventually, the relationship with the neighboring colonies changed, and the trade deals began to dry up. After her final return trip, Onesan was suddenly very eager to be with her estranged husband again. It seemed like all the time and distance apart helped her to forgive him. In a strange cosmic coincidence, Steel had broken up with the other colonist while Onesan had been away on her last trip. They got back together, and for one more year they enjoyed each other more than they ever had before. \n\nOn the day she died, Onesan was hunting near the edge of the map, far away from the colony. A large pack of manhunting arctic wolves entered the map almost on top of her. Onesan was ripped to shreds and bled to death before Steel and everyone else had even left the safety of the walls. \n\nAs the final member of the original colonists and the colony's informal leader, Onesan deserved the best possible funeral. A catacomb was excavated for her deep inside the nearby mountain, and a solid silver sarcophagus was placed inside for her to rest in. Steel constructed the sarcophagus for his wife personally. It was excellent quality.\n\nHe titled the sarcophagus Shadow of Onesan. The description reads:\n\n\"The sarcophagus is engraved with a picture of Ryoko 'Onesan' Minase practicing construction skills with visible exhaustion. Hundreds of cowboys watch with amazement. The work seems to represent suffering. The lower part of the image is dominated by a large group of shamans. This representation tells the story of Onesan becoming a master at construction tasks on 5th of Septober, 5509.\"\n\nYou can see a screenshot I took of it here. https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/781857270461047007/2BD4EB8FCD3C4627D00A25CDB42AC71B4F179355/\n\nI'm not sure why, but Onesan's death did not make Steel upset. I know she was important to him, though. He would leave his work at the machining bench all the time to visit her sarcophagus. He'd always be there for a long time, staring down at it. I've been paying closer attention to him since Onesan died, and as far as I can tell he hasn't flirted with any of the other colonists since her death.\n\nEventually I decided that Steel was going to focus on leading Onesan's people off the planet. Now he sits at the research bench every day, slowly unlocking the path to the stars. \n\nI like to imagine that someday when the ship is ready he will send her people off, but instead of going with them he will stay behind on the planet to be with her.", "timestamp_created": 1564983451, "timestamp_updated": 1660796751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 659, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.958927631378173828", "comment_count": 32, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119331574": {"recommendationid": "119331574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300268359", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1037, "last_played": 1684521713}, "language": "english", "review": "\nfirst time playing rimworld, finished tutorial\nstart a new colony, find a male rat and name him Ratatouille\nnot even a few in-game days later, get attacked by a raider\nRatatouille ends up being the first to attack the raider\nraider kills Ratatouille, but not before my loyal pet rat could get a few good scratches/bites in\nnot even 10 seconds after raider kills Ratatouille, the raider passes out from blood loss (and later dies) just from the sheer amount of rat bites/scratches\n\nRatatouille risked his life to save my tiny little colony that was just starting out.

And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]", "timestamp_created": 1510020807, "timestamp_updated": 1650555657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 566, "votes_funny": 598, "weighted_vote_score": "0.952034711837768555", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43429266": {"recommendationid": "43429266", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978098899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 92920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33104, "last_played": 1694605359}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been fiddling around with challenging game modes rather than the stock three. So I began a game with absolutely nothing other than the starting colonist, no food, no weapon, no silver. I've then opted then to go for a mountainous region cause it's easier to defend from attackers.\n\nThis is where things get interesting, normally what happens now is you get to choose your colonist. I thought \"Right, i want a good miner, someone who can farm relatively well and I guess a good fighter to start off with\". Off I go cycling through the colonists where I stumble upon Patrice. Patrice was shit at everything, I'm talking zero's, one's and two's across the board, with the exception of Art which was seven and Social which was bloody eighteen.\n\nI thought to myself, how the hell does she have such a high social skill so I read her backstory. Now Patrice was just twenty years old, very young but she had done so much. Patrice wanted to sing for everybody, luckily for her, Dad was the CEO of an interplanetary corporation and set her up as a Childhood Idol. Patrice sang her poor heart out for everybody and made her parents proud. Until her mum died, dad was beside himself, lost in his thoughts, Patrice at this stage was developing into a woman and 'offered' herself to dad as a replacement for mum which he accepted....\n\nThe shenanighans went on until the corporation executives discovered Patrice and dad's secret and gave dad an ultimatum, \"Give us your daughter or we go public with what's been happening between you two, ruining both your lives in the process\". Dad agreed and sent poor Patrice away.\n\nThe executives kept Patrice in an orbital station on the galactic fringes far away from daddy, where they used Patrice for a new kind of job, if you know what I mean, say hello to Patrice's adult background Pornographic Idol. Yes you read that correctly, Patrice was now sold into sexual slavery. But it wasn't all that bad, she wasn't a typical 'whore' as it where, more like a Companion from Firefly where she selected her clients. She became very popular amongst the nobility of the region. Attended balls and had a cult following, much like her childhood.\n\nI thought to myself \"Holy crap Batman WTF did I just read?\". This story was absolutely nuts, I had to try to help Patrice live a better life. Off we went to Patrice's new home. I'm assuming at this stage she's been rescued by some unknown benefactor. Anyway, Patric lands right in the centre of a small clearing surrounded by mountain with only one opening and fertile land within that area too. \"Score!!\" I thought as I got her to work setting up a shelter, bed and torch. Bloody hell wasn't this a task for her? It took two days to complete this menial task but together we persevered. Eventually she completed this task cutting down a dozen trees in the process and skilling up two levels in construction.\n\nThen the feral rabbit came knocking, \"Crap\" I had to get her to safety, fortunately this rabbit tired itself rather quickly and left Patrice alone after it slept. I got Patrice to fashion herself a club to use and just in the nick of time, well I say nick of time but it took her a whole day to get this done too. At this stage she hasn't even gotten to setting up a farm, luckily there are heaps of wild berries around.\n\nA visitor arrives and Patrice says hi but she has no goods to sell so they leave in a hurry, as they are leaving sirens roar as we're under attack. The attacker has a shiv, loves to fight and has eight skill. \"We're finished\" I think as the attacker runs down towards the village but attacks the visitor, the visitor manages to put a solid slug into the attacker but is killed in the process. The attacker is wounded but proceeds to move towards Patrice, I order Patrice to stay behind the door ready with her club. The attacker busts the door down and charges in but after suffering from blood loss Patrice is able to knock him out with a single swing from her club.\n\nPatrice locks him up in her room after fixing the door and manages to stop the bleeding thanks to some bandages the visitor had. Then I got to see Patrice do what she did best, talk to people. You see what normally happens is these attackers are hard as nails to recruit to your village, with some taking days and even seasons before joining your community, Patrice didn't even need food to entice him, as soon as she walked into the room he instantly switched sides and became Patrice's bitch. \n\nPatrice was a God amongst men as she began her new dynasty, Patrice settled into her new roles as town artist and socialite, while minion one got to work erecting a wall, finishing some farmland and contructing a kitchen and dining room for Patrice to enjoy, all in a day's work as it were.\n\nPatrice gathered up the supplies the visitor 'donated' equiping herself with a rifle in the process and set to work skilling up. It was like a switch was flicked, now she had a minion to dominate she finished everything with precision and haste. She developed a taste in gardening as the minion went to work digging out the tunnels, constructing two cells for conversation duties and completing a new throne room and Queen's chambers for Patrice.\n\nThis is where the story of Patrice ends..... for now... I'm actually looking forward to resuming the tale of Patrice.\n\nRimworld can be full of trash, normally I would look purely at the stats of a character to pick them for me but Patrice has changed my attitude here, now I look at the stories these colonists have as the main driving factor in selecting them.\n\nEdit: Just getting my point for a review, listing Rimworld for GOTY\n\nFYI I have the Patrice save file, played a touch, she's still alive.", "timestamp_created": 1531163036, "timestamp_updated": 1542872948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 608, "votes_funny": 223, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950691521167755127", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36646516": {"recommendationid": "36646516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012478199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1640, "last_played": 1513785593}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a colony, GREAT colony. Had Olga the spy, the fucking best. \n\nI sent out a caravan to go save this guy who gets downed outside the borders. So the colony splits into two. Little did I realize, only one person I left behind could fight fires, Jess the cook. The caravan lead by Olga finds the dude, fixes him and they get dragged back after a extra day of getting split up before returning to the colony. \n\nMeanwhile, at the main base, a pack of MANHUNTING RABBITS decided to swarm the colony. No big deal. All the rabbits get funneled in and get slaughtered. Acouple people get bit and have to be patched up. So lots of people are sleeping off being covered in rabbit bites. Suddenly, there's a heat wave. Lots of rabbits lying in the open on the floors, and people spend all night stuffing rabbits into the freezer before they rot. They go to sleep late, whatever. There wasn't alot of meat left.\n\nQUEUE TRAGIC AS FUCK EVENT- there is a fault in the electrical system. Dead. Center. In. The. Colony. Jess being the only one who can fight fires gets out of bed as quick as a man covered in rabbit bites can and starts putting out the fires, but not before the fire has already spread into the warehouse and then subsequently to the lower housing area- that happens to have wood floors and all wooden beds. Jess is attempting to fight the fires alone for hours, but not before it becomes too much and begins SUPERHEATING THE FUCKING COLONY to 1400 degrees in certain rooms. He has to take breaks running in and out of the compound as he tries in vain to fight the fire. Finally it's called to just let the colony burn. Everyone evacutes the building, it can be rebuilt. But not before people get trapped inside. Colonists braving the superheated building attempting to find fallen comrades pull them outside while receiving burns from the superheated air.\nThe caravan returns, a billow of smoke is seen. The returning colonists who don't fear the fire begin fighting it as best as they can. The warehouse is lost at this point, but losing the fridge would be a death sentence. They lock up in the fridge and begin putting out fires as they come. It isn't enough. They get pulled out and collapse on the ground outside, those not trained in the medical arts doing their best to traige as the wounded come in. \n\nTony doesn't make it. The combination of the colony turned crematorium with the heat wave occuring outside puts him under. He stares vacantly into the rain beating down, appreciating the irony of the situation. Tony outreaches to his trusted alpaca companion, Animal. He was never good at names. He came from a group of tribals. The alpaca gives a 1000 yard stare back to his human compatriot. Realizing the man who had trained him had passed, Animal slips into a state similar to a man wandering in sadness. Maybe Animal, being far more intelligent than humans believed granted upon a simple llama, wondered what gods would cruely taunt those who needed water to extinguish the flames that consume their home in the night.\n\nThe fire burned. Like a bright star on the blackest night. All the colonists could do was watch many yards away as everything they had helped to create together be consumed by the raging inferno. It would not be quick. The colony was a mountain converted into a grand residence. It took nearly the whole night until it was safe enough to stamp out the embers. The rain still pouring down on the faces of those who were barely able to move. Of Animal, who stared his thousand yard alpaca stare into the smoldering ashes of what was once a home.(edited)\nAs the fire was put out, nearly every colonist was suffering from heatstroke. Olga, Jess, Niko, Charna, Charles, Lucy, the new colonists Malakor and Miles. They all were hurried into the freezer. Still somehow working became the new triage center. Infections from burns began to set in. Many things were lost, the fire consumed all, including all the weapons left behind colonists felled by the inferno. It wouldn't end well if they were attacked, but luckily they all for the most part survived and had enough food and medicine to rebuild. \n\nKNOCK KNOCK- Who's there? The Federation mother fucker.\n\nBomb bots began flooding in from the north. Many, too many. No one had time to react. Only two of the colonists were even armed at the time, few guns were scattered around in the home, somehow surviving the brutal flames. Olga and Malakor took a position against a few rocks as Lucy and Jess frantically searched for weapons. Olga the best shot in the whole colony, readied her sniper rifle but already knew what the outcome would be. While waiting as the bots began to stride quickly across the farm fields, there was a time for a brief conversation between the two. Malakor laid his hand on his husky Senaca, comforting her for the last time. The conversation had a good final affect on morale as the two were swarmed and disappeared into a brilliant explosion of red mist and scrap metal. Senaca somehow survived the intial explosion but it mattered not. The Federation didn't spread so far and wide because of mercy.(edited)\nLucy and Jess having retrieved weapons, made their way outside but that would have been the final nail in everyone's coffin. A series of chain explosions ripped through the hallways. The structure supporting a mountain was no longer able to bear the weight as the night before left it weakened. The mountain collapsed. All those left trapped in the triage freezer perished instantly. \n\nThe fields of healroot swayed. They wouldn't be needed any longer. The wind turbine would eventually fall into a state of disrepair and crumbling. Looters would come and pillage anything not nailed down. But they would return to their colonies. Speaking of a single being who survived. \n\nA lone alpaca, with a saddlebag strapped to it's back.

So, I'll classify RimWorld as a lifestyle instead of a game. I was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game (almost) daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime (before the game was avaible on Steam). So yes, I'll recommend this game and give it a positive review. \n\nThe best way that I can describe RimWorld is the aesthetics of Prison Architect mixed with elements of Dwarf Fortress set in a Firefly styled Universe. In it's heart, it's a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from \"civilization\". You make the decisions to equip, shelter, feed, and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions. \n\nSure, the game is still in Early Access (Alpha 14 at the time of posting), but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple AI types to \"guide\" your gameplay. The game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game. The modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated.\n\nWith that said, the game may be a little daunting for new players. There are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn. My suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes. When your colony dies, restart a new map and learn from your mistakes. Losing is fun.\n\nAll in all, it's worth the $30 - even if $30 is expensive for an indie game. I mean, you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist's lungs. \n\nAs I said before, I did purchase the game through kickstarter, but the developer added me to the game as a character - so I didn't technically get this game for free, but I did a bit of a bonus.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/prfNPt23G4A", "timestamp_created": 1468604840, "timestamp_updated": 1468684815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 768, "votes_funny": 58, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950134575366973877", "comment_count": 45, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26221929": {"recommendationid": "26221929", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973757779", "num_games_owned": 779, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 390182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4479, "last_played": 1692914961}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy Dwarf Fortress. But I felt disconnected with my dwarves. Honestly, 80 dwarves in one fort, and I'm supposed to care about how my Baron feels?\n\nThen I tried RimWorld. I got it October 20th of 2016. And. I pretty much played it for near 20 hour stretches. Until that Sunday night when I realized, \"I have work on Monday.\"\n\nMy first colony was thrown together in something of a huff as I didn't know what I was really doing, but the game is very straightforward so once I figured things out (and the ingame helper is a nice touch, Devs. Kudos), I was grooving.\n\nMy two main colonists were a fighter and doctor, plus a crafter. They got along. All was well. Between the mining, expanding, animal taming, it all felt very easily managable. There were a few mistakes, but the colony thrived.\n\nUntil he came along. The pyromaniac. He would occassionally start fires, usually after being rebuffed by the good female doctor who had her eyes on someone else. Often this would lead to him being arrested and thrown into a cell. If the fires were set away from the compound, then that was fine.\n\nIt kept getting to the point everyone was tired of his abrasive attitude and having to put out his fires. Literally. His mood would always tank after the tribal and pirate raids, yet he seemed ecstatic when it came to lobbing his molotov cocktails at the would be attackers.\n\nThen IT landed. An AI Core. The crafter had gone out to retrieve something, and that triggered the core. Out slothed a slow moving, minigun armed slug. Everyone went on alert and was ready to fight, armed with the pistol, rifle, and knife that remained. The fighter died in a hail of bullets. He died. Blown literally into pieces infront of the good doctor. She went berserk, broken at the sight of her lover ripped to pieces. For all of the 5 seconds of rage the slug allowed before she was mowed down as well.\n\nThe crafter turned tail and ran. Fear had overtaken him. He dashed into the recesses of the compound. The pyro had long since lost his mind, laughing and setting fires, about the colony, then in the compound. The first to burn up were the dearly dismembered lovers. The crafter tried to fight back the impending flames by was consumed.\n\nAs the slug advanced, our moronic miscreant looked to the slug, then back to the flames... It was a simple choice in his mind. The loving, warm embrace of a firey death. The single thing he loved more than anything else in his life. A deep laugh emanting from the depth of his core as he leapt into the raging inferno.\n\n\n\n\n.... Meanwhile I'm sitting here watching this all unfold sipping a red bull like, \"... THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME.\" Rolled another colony and was up till 5:30am the next day still playing. This repeated ad nasuem all weekend in a variety of scenarios, now enabled by some mods, because hey, themed plays are fun. Especially the Cannibal Run. Oh man. That was... That was really bad.\n\nThen monday morning I show up to work looking like I'd been partying all weekend: \"Dude are you okay? You sound like shit. How much did you drink?\" \"... Rimworld.\" \"Huh?\" \"... I was playing RimWorld. All weekend.\" \"Oh. Is that a game?\" \"Yeah.\" \"S'it any good?\" \"... Yes. Yes it is very good.\"\n\nSo that's my review of RimWorld. The first game I have played in the last 10 years that has managed to keep me up past 2am (when I usually pass out), through consecutive days without any pings of boredom or tedium. That hasn't happened in a very long time.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me? I have to plan out my Squirrel God playthrough. A mad human colonist with a bomb in his head, and ascetic tastes for squirrels. To raise them, to eat them, to create and command an army of them. And DEATH. DEATH TO ALL WHO OPPOSE US!! .... Maybe he'll let in the occassional boom rat. We'll see. Either way we're gonna have a lot of fun, am I right? :D", "timestamp_created": 1477432862, "timestamp_updated": 1477432862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 396, "votes_funny": 205, "weighted_vote_score": "0.949880719184875488", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32864623": {"recommendationid": "32864623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024524401", "num_games_owned": 1033, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 3278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1513, "last_played": 1539984473}, "language": "english", "review": "You're reading the reviews thinking: \"Damn, some of these people have like 300+ hours on this, they must really like it.\" Then you're looking at the price thinking: \"That much?\" Definitely worth it in my opinion. And I've only played for 20 hours (and have gotten not too much done, because there is so much to do).  It's the best base-building survival I've played yet. You get attached enough to some of your colonists that you become sad if anything happens to them. \n\nYou can build your colony however you want to. Think of it like a top-down minecraft. You're not limited on how you want to build your base at all, except you can't build multi-leveled buildings. (Two-story).\n\nEvery colonist has their own personality. IE: My hunter Lumine is probably one of my most useful colonists. She can snipe targets from long distances with perfect headshots. However, Lumine is staggeringly ugly and has an annoying voice. So my colonists don't really like her much.  My surgeon Toni has been through so much. She has gotten her leg and arm ripped off, so I've operated on her and given her a metal arm and leg. She is literally Edward Elric, except instead of fighting Scar she is healing Scars. \n\nDifferent Survival Elements. You need to keep your colonists cool when it's hot, and warm when it's cold. You can do this in different ways such as crafting them the right clothing, and having heaters/coolers. Your colonists need to eat. You can have them eat raw humans and animals like savages, or you can have them butcher animals, and cook different meals so that they can stay healthy. You need to build a freezer so that your food won't deteriorate. You need a medical room for the best effective chances of successful operations and treatment. You'll need to build wind turbines and solar generators so you can give power to the things in your base that require it. You need to build a research bench and research new... well, basically everything. So the game doesn't just give you everything that's available. You have to work for it. \n\nIn the regular mode of the base game, you start off with 3 colonists. And you stick with them for a while and think: \"When am I going to get more? This is kind of slow since I only have 3 people.\" Next thing you know, you have like 10 people who are all doing their own jobs. Be it people you recruited, or people who fell from cargo pods from space.\n\nAnd I've only been talking about your base. This game has an entirely randomly generated world that your colony is in. Which means trade caravans will visit you, different tribes will visit you. You can visit them by forming caravans of your own. You can even raid other bases. You can eventually build comms equipment to contact different trading ships that are in orbit, or the different outposts nearby. And you will get raided by a lot of different outposts as well, which means you will have to set up defences. You can take prisoners and either recruit them, release them, eat them, or harvest them for their organs. Yep. Don't want those perfectly good kidneys to go to waste now do we? If you don't want to take prisoners, you can have your colonist slit the injured guys throat. It's cold, man. They just walk right up to the injured fella and either shoot them until they die, or brutally stab them to death.\n\nNow one important thing that this game offers which any good game offers: Mods.\nTo me, mods fill the important content that the developers have not added yet. More turrets, more organized menus, more furniture, more everything. Even the option to show visitors hospitality so that you can better establish friendship, or even recruit them to your colony!  I can't imagine playing the game without some of the mods that I have installed. Not that the vanilla game is bad, it's just that some of the mods are so useful and necessary that I wouldn't want to play without them. And none of the mods I have are cheats either. You need to use your valuable recourses in order to craft everything, including objects from mods. So definitely check the workshop out once you get the game. \n\nThe only negative that I have so far isn't very much a negative of the game but just me being a little whiner.\nSometimes, some of the random events are very highly not in your favor, and completely unfair. Which will result in you reloading an autosave or main save, just to prevent the event from happening. When you reload a save, that event that played out gets replaced with a different random event. So you're getting raided by a bunch of people while half your colonists have severe illnesses? No worries! Just reload a save! It's saved my colony a bunch of times. Sometimes I've let some of my colonists die and I've continued the game, but most of the time I just reload an autosave to prevent their deaths. It's an easy way to cheat the system. \n\nOverall, it's a great game. There is a reason you're seeing people with hundreds of hours on it. Every single player's game is different. Different bases, different colonists. So many outcomes. It's why you see so many people posting their stories on their reviews. It's a game that I didn't even know I wanted until I played it. Amazing community. Especially the modding community. It's making the game so much more than it already is. \n\n10/10 would have one of my rookie hunters shoot at a hare 40 times point blank, only to miss, give up, and go stargaze. \n\nOh and don't let your colonists go on a mental breakdown. ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE PYROMANIC TRAIT. My god. Freakin Engie, literally sets fire to everything she helped build. Try to arrest them or reload a save.

And warcrimes.\n\nOne such case: my faction was raided by the ruthless pirate faction - one of their largest raids yet. They were throwing everything they had at me. Powered armor, miniguns, plasma weaponry. It was a hard fought battle. But something caught my eye at the start, a particular soldier with remarkable stats and the best geared of the group. This man was the faction leaders son. \n\nNot long after their raid turned south i began harvesting organs from the survivors as per routine. But I had something evil planned for the son. I decided to turn him into my only prisoner. I removed his limbs and left him with only what he needed to live, and fed him his fallen comrades from the most recent raid. After all was done, I loaded him into a cargo pod and launched him at his fathers homelands. \"To send a message.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before they responded. Hard. A raid of immeasurable size came back, the son that I had launched at them prior was with the group - with him his father. His limbs restored with advanced bionics far beyond any mundane soldier. Randy Random the god of my world, had decided that my evil acts would not go unchecked; A solar flair hit my base at the same time, knocking out my defences. Leaving my 5 super soldiers versus their army. It was a bloody fought battle.\nThe faction leader was one of the first to fall, and their numbers were thinning. A wrongly placed missile wiped half their own, but took out 2 of my super soldiers in the blast. One died to shrapnel to the skull instantly. The other clinging to life on the ground. My three other soldiers were dropping one by one, until the enemy faction decided to flee, attempting to take what they could and leave after facing such casualties. The son of the faction, ready to leave to take up his fathers position of leader had planned to take one of my super soldiers of his own, but I couldn't face to let that happen. Beaten and bruised I had a single soldier still standing whom ran to face the son in a one on one, hand to hand fight. Mano a mano. My soldier, their arms fitted with blades within their wrists like some kind of horrifying techno wolverine, the enemy stood strong, head to toe in bionics like a bloodied terminator. The first punch was thrown by my soldier, ripping his arm off in one. But machine parts don't feel, and he didn't flinch to the pain. He threw his one and only punch. Powered by bionics a servo punch so strong it ripped my soldiers bionic jaw off in one, dropping him to the ground. \n\nAnd that was how my colony of 5 super soldiers ended.

Sounds like a scam to me.\"\n\nWell, as it turns out, I bought it anyway. And for what the $30 is worth?\n\nIt's a fucking scam.\n\nThe game plays out where you have a couple people on a ship, or something, and crashlanding into what is pretty much a space version of the wild west.\n\nThese pawns are what pretty much what you use to play the game. You essentially kind of psudeo-control these pawns that don't have functioning brains, and you set up schedules, work priorities, all that colony simulator stuff. The entire game is just based around managing your colony; at least, that's what my first impressions were.\n\nA random bandit raid comes 30 minutes into the game. Only one guy. Probably a self-proclaimed pirate. No big deal, my pawns just gunned him down.\n\nNow, we have this unslightly guy outside of our base, bleeding out because he thought he could 1v3 my colony like he was some Metal Gear assassin sort of guy.\n\nOh, then I checked his stats.\n\nYou see, in this game, pawns have these designated stats that are all trainable. These stats are sort of like an RPG trope ordeal where you have to train them at those skills so they get better stats. The pawns I started out with, one was an okay constructor, the other a doctor, and the third one was not good at anything, but she could still kind of get the job done.\n\nNow, this pirate?\n\nHe had the most atrocious stats I have ever seen in my life. In fact, he was only good at one thing, which was punching. Couldn't even help with the farm or anything because he was 'incapable' of doing so. Any sort of skilled labor just wasn't his thing.\n\nStill, I decided to tidy him up, and try to recruit him. After all, you may be only good at one thing, but we sure as hell need a janitor to clean these dirty as hell rooms, since the dirt and grime was pretty much pissing off my pawn's moodlet bars.\n\nFew hours go by, and I'm already invested into this brawler janitor guy. You see, my colonists wanted everything. They wanted a good looking bedroom, a place to lounge in, some horseshoes to play with, but not the janitor dude.\n\nHe was an ascetic. Gave him a garbage room with dirt as his floor and an awful bed. He didn't mind it. No, in fact, he was happy with it. This guy pretty much never had a crappy mood and just did his work, no questions asked. Cleaned the kitchen, the dining room, the bedrooms, the farms, the outside, without a single complaint. I liked him. He was cool.\n\nOur colony started booming. Naturally, when any colony starts to get rolling, they start rolling hard. And when the colony gets rolling, the money starts rolling right in.\n\nYou see, we were the biggest dealer in corn that the world had ever seen. Every time a trading caravan from a neighboring colony came in, we got ourselves a giant wad of cash for every harvest of every year. And with that giant wad of cash, as any functional human being would do, we started spending that on a bunch of cool as hell stuff. \n\nShield belts. Charge rifles. Bionic body parts. Gigantic statues. And of course, an EXCESS amount of chocolate. Because why the hell not.\n\nWell, of course, since we were pretty much balling on money, people started to take notice. And, unfortunately, not all of them were good people.\n\nPirate raids started to come in, and we fought them off every time. Every time we finished a raid, we'd go ahead, and try to recruit some of these guys. Some of them joined, others were still hesitant. Sooner or later, we had a massive prison size of 11 people, and 7 people as colonists. With that population, food was bound to dwindle, but I figured that it wouldn't have mattered since we were in a tropical rain forest, where food was everywhere, and farming season was pretty much all the time.\n\nI was woefully unprepared for the events to come.\n\nSome other city thought that it was an absolute GENIUS idea to use their chemical radioactive fuel or whatever, and as it turned out, it wasn't so genius after all. My entire region was poisoned. By toxic fallout.\n\nThing is, it's impossible to grow crops outside in a toxic fallout. So my entire crop system started dying out.\n\nWell, I figured, maybe we can hold out on food stores for a while, and I did just that.\n\nFood stores cut in half after the first week. Toxic fallout wasn't letting up any time soon, so I was forced to let go of the prisoners outside to fend for themselves. My colony was going to be eaten out of food, and I wasn't going to let my colonists starve just to feed some idiots who do not understand the gloriousness of my colony.\n\nLuckily for me, the fallout lifted right before our food stores would hit zero. Of course, right after that happened, I started hauling ass, telling my pawns to get to work farming right away so we would have food again.\n\nThen, a ship crashlands straight into the north side of my base.\n\nI had no idea what that thing was. It sat there for a few days, humming some weird crap, then I noticed that it was making snow. And killing plants around it.\n\nIt was the same god damned 'toxic fallout' thing, but this time, it was spreading from the ship.\n\nI hated toxic fallout. It forced me to let go of all the prisoners I was about to recruit. It made me lose farming time that could have been spent farming corn.\n\nSo naturally, with my hate for this poison ship, I woke up my colonists, and then attacked the ship.\n\nWhat happened next, I couldn't believe it.\n\nRobot aliens. Counted 4 super-sized centipede slug things and 5 scyther robot things. I have never seen robot aliens up until this point, so I had no idea what these things were capable of.\n\nWe started shooting them down.\n\nThe mechanoids were not fazed.\n\nOne of the scythers took a shot. Aimed it. Fired.\n\nMy best shooter instantly died as the charged weapon shredded his brains out.\n\nI was forced to move retreat back to the base, where the sandbags were so they could take cover.\n\nMeanwhile, the centipedes just arrived as reinforcements after the scythers were sniping my main defending force off one by one.\n\nThe centipedes started mowing everyone down; colonists died left and right.\n\nThe only people left at this point was the doctor, who was bleeding out fast, and the janitor, who was rescuing the doctor to the hospital.\n\nIn a last ditch effort to try to save what I had left, I sent my janitor to rush into the fray.\n\nAs he charged in, a scyther instantly broke his shield with a well-timed shot. The janitor cleanly swiped off the scyther's neck, downing it, and then moved onto the next scyther.\n\nA bystanding scyther, watching this take place, takes fire only to accidentally shoot his ally directly in the thorax.\n\nWith it down, he moved towards the last scyther.\n\nThis time wasn't so lucky for him.\n\nThe fourth scyther sliced at his right arm, destroying it, as the scyther dodged his attacks, and sliced again at his neck, swiftly decapitating his head clean off.\n\nIn a manner of minutes, my entire colony was dismantled. The buildings were razed in an inferno, and all my colonists had died, save for one. The doctor, whimpering in the corner of the hospital; the floor soaked in her own blood.\n\nI watched for the last few minutes as she bled out, and died right there. Alone, as the building around her burnt into ashes and crumbled.\n\nI felt bad. My colony was short-lived. I thought I had it all. I thought I was invincible. Hell, I survived a toxic fallout. Of course I thought I was invincible. And I was so invested into that colony too.\n\nSo, I decided. This game is a god damn scam. What kind of sane developer makes me feel this emotion, in a video game no less? A crook, that's who. For $30, you made me suffer. You made me addicted to this game, to the point where I have played for a total of 300 hours as of this review.\n\nAll I can say, Tynan Sylvester, is that you are a crook.

Vanilla Rimworld is amazing; yet the DLC and especially the mods make this my favorite game of all time.\n\nAs others have pointed out, its all about the \"headcanon\" (the story you make in your mind as you play). My first game included a young man, a young woman, an old man, and a dog. The two young people fell for each other, and the old man was the animal handler so I assumed it was his dog from the start. The lady is out harvesting berries and an event occurs: \"Mad Chinchilla\". Apparently, this chinchilla did not like the lady picking berries, so it attacked her. This doesn't seem like a big deal, and it normally would not have been.\n\nExcept this lady was a pacifist. She couldn't attack anything. So she takes off running. I get the old man to come to her rescue (he was the best shot and had a rifle). He meets her as she is running, and fires a single shot...\n\nHe shot the lady in the face. In my mind, this is because there was a backstory between the two of them, and he did not like her.\n\nHe then also killed the chinchilla. He brings the lady back to our single-room house and tries to treat her leaking facehole. His medical skills are lacking.\n\nWhere is the young man? He was off mining some steel. Not that he could've helped, because he can't shoot and his medical skills are also lacking. He enters the house just in time to see the love of his live die from acute lead poisoning to the face.\n\nHe snaps. Going into a rage, he attacks the old man. The old man goes down after being stabbed a bunch, but the dog...\n\nTHE DOG...\n\nHe saves the old man. He takes down the young man and kills him, and sits by his owner.\n\nHis owner is slowly bleeding out (You can have people self-treat wounds, but I did not know it at the time). He is unconscious, but seems to be stable. Until he gets an infection.\n\nThe infection eventually kills him. He never regained consciousness.\n\nMy colony failed. The End. To this day (3500+ hours later) whenever I see a dog, I assume it is The Dog. Sometimes he has found a new handler, sometimes the new handler is evil and The Dog pays the prices. Other times The Dog has returned to the wild. That's when I am happiest to see him.\n\n\n\nSee, the game is a story-telling device. Originally there was no winning, and to this day I have not ever actually finished a colony. I always either get steamrolled after 20+ hours or get bored and start over.

Early in my first run I realized that tamed animals sold for reasonable amounts of silver to caravans so I tried taming all kind of things.  Long story short I ended up with a raccoon that I constantly had to adjust zones for to keep him out of my hydroponics, walk-in cooler, gardens, etc. because this little critter would eat almost anything.  Well, to my dismay I soon found out no one wants a raccoon, not settlements nor passing trade caravans, and I'm not the kind of guy who just kills pixelated pets for no reason.  I set his training on the highest it would go and forgot about him.  Pretty soon I caught on to the fact that in good weather you could send your useless animals with your trade caravans and they would forage rather than eating anything in reach, and I kept hoping against hope I'd find someone to buy him.   \n    So I send this furry little parasite out on another trade caravan and for the first time I get ambushed.... by 2 man-eating Yorkshire terriers.  I have two colonists with rifles and reasonable shooting stats and they miss and miss and miss.  One of the terriers reaches the first colonist and while he isn't a danger injured colonists are a pain in the ass and I would guess even more so on a caravan.  Then, too my complete surprise, my raccoon intercepted the second Yorkie and held it at bay until one of my semi useless colonists finally managed to pray to the RNG gods and get a hit in.

It's purpose is to tell a story, whether of joy or sorrow, and it accomplishes this well. Let me share with you my favorite story so far, which lasted about 10-15 hours in real life.\n\nI finally made a colony that lasted longer than a year before the narrorator decided that this story was ready for a twist. 3 years in. Population is up to 7-8 people at the same time; work was getting done. Solid defense multiple blocks deep surrounding the entire base. Enough food to last for 2 years. Raiders don't stand a chance.\n\nRandy decides he's been too easy on me. First wave of raiders equiped with heavy artillery arrives. After hours, they blast a crack in my wall and flood in. My colonists have been waiting. Firing commences. Bullets fly, blood spills and bodies drop. The raiders grab 3 of my people before they retreat. I save one of them but the others are gone for good. Time to rescue and restore.\n\nHours after the first attack, the next raid begins. The crack hasn't been repaired because most of my colony is in the hospital. A few good soldiers answer the call for justice and defend the homeland. They quickly dispense of the second wave but sustain minor injuries. Time to visit the hospital.\n\nHours later the third strike falls upon us. This battle will be a last stand. I send those able to walk out to the battlefield, likely to take thier last breaths. They meet the aggressors at the door and unleash their weapons. This desperate attempt to save the colony ends like many wars -- neither side claims victory as we all strive to hang on. They capture two of mine, but we take down 3 of theirs.\n\nOnly three reamain, wounded and unconcious. Luckily, my doctor is still alive and well, making her rounds amongst the two soldiers. We survived the war . . . or so we thought. The siren wails again as a final wave of raiders enters the arena. These lone stragglers are equipped with shoddy wooden melee weapons, but the odds are five to one. My doctor greets them at the door with an LMG and fights to her last breath. The wounded hear her screams and answer the call. Using their guns as crutches, they hobble to the entrance and face certain demise. Their only thought, \"We're taking them with us.\"\n\nThey fight their way through the flames and rubble that they once called home, stabbing and shotting anything that moved. The raiders retreat, but we won't allow them to get far. Not today. They chase the raiders to the gates, cornering them against the wall. The grim reaper is amongst us. They fire as long as thier strength can hold the gun before falling to the ground due to blood loss. One soldier dies while the last man finishes the assult.\n\nWith every raider dead, the lone soldier returns to his room, passing his fallen comrades along the way. He eats his last meal and grab some Flake to unwind. He locks himself in the Rec room and lights up to ease the pain. He thinks back to the story that was told within these walls. The crash landing and the first walls. The famines and the feasts. The wars won and the people lost. He finishes his first pipe full and decides to light another dose of flake. His blood is draining as he slips in to an overdosed coma of ecstasy and joins his friends in the light. \n\nWith him, dies the legacy of this grand colony. Perhaps some day another weary traveler will stumble upon its walls and take shelter.  Maybe they will wonder of the epic tale that transpired, looking upon the works that his hands created. Or maybe the dust of the mountain will consume this town and its insignificant story. After all, in the end, we're all just dust in the wind.\n\nI love this game and highly reccomend it to anyone that enjoys games like Banished, Prison Architect and Don't Starve. Don't play to win, play to live.

I sent John because he was a fast walker, and thought it would be good to get there as fast as possible. Unfortunately, once I got there I realized my mistake; John had no medical skill. April couldn't walk. I quickly mined out a cave to be out of the elements, and laid April down to rest. In the meantime, I put John to work. Now John's not a great cook, but they needed something to eat being stranded so far from home. Luckily, a Lynx had recently killed a boar, so I had John butcher the boar and cook its meat over a campfire. Remember, John's not a great cook. He fed April while she was resting, and she got food poisoning. So she couldn't walk, and was throwing up. They had nothing else to eat, so John got food poisoning as well. \n\nI soon realized I needed a doctor to get out here fast, and with more food. So I grabbed about 10 simple meals and 5 medical packs and sent York on his way. In the meantime, John tended to April, and swept dirt out of the cave. When York was about halfway there, April was well enough to walk, so I sent John and her to meet him halfway. John and April had just enough food to make it to York, but then I realized they did not have enough food for all of them to make it home. So, here comes Orr. I took no chances this time, grabbed the rest of my food and quickly set off. \n\nBack at the settlement, Chef woke up one morning and realized no one else was around, so he did what he always did and just continued making meals. All of a sudden, an explosion occurred in the middle of the base. Considering it was all made up of wood, it immediately went up in flames. Chef attempted to tame the flames, but then the dog, Hilda, caught fire. I thought to myself, save the house or save the dog? Chef rushed outside to chase Hilda down and pat out the fire. She was saved. The house, not so much. However, for some reason Hilda rushed back inside, most likely to save her favorite bed. The flames engulfed her, and with no safe access Chef couldn\u2019t save her again. Oh yeah, I also had a random rat that died too. Rat 1. \n\nChef was dying of heatstroke, but thankfully it was winter, so he rested outside till he was well enough.

This is a 35$ game that could very well be worth 60$. The replayability is way up there, and you can play it however you want. It is a sandbox colony management simulator afterall. Wanna have a colony who's sole economy is reliant on human organs? Go for it. Wanna do a cannibalistic nude amazon-only colony that genocides males and leaves their corpses in mass graves on the outside to deter raiders? Totally up to you. Just wanna take it easy and come home from a stressful day of work to a comfy boring ol' colony? Hey, I ain't judging and this is getting off track, but you get the general idea. With Rimworld the only limitation is your creativity, time to murder, and sacrificing your [strike]soul[/strike]social life for just one more colony run.\n\nThe workshop community is enormous. So if you ever get tired of just a vanilla game or two, you can always dive into the rabbit hole to spice up your game more. There's things ranging from simple quality of life ui improvements to full blown overhaul packs. There's a mod for everyone on the workshop. I mean, there's even a mod for having catgirl colonists, I think you get the idea. \n\nRather you're a fan of colony management sims or interested in trying one, I think Rimworld is more than good enough for that criteria. It's easy to get into thanks to the various 'storytellers' mechanic that you can configurable to your leisure. But it can, and will, get despairingly cruel and unforgiving at even slightly harder difficulties. Which depends on storytellers as well. The best part is you can change them to your hearts content so if you're feeling overwhelmed by the difficulty you're able to tone it down a notch and play at your own pace without much of anu bad events in the way. There's even mods that add new storytellers for even greater enrichment of your experience. \n\nOverall, Rimworld has a speculator design philosophy. If it was a religion I'd be a devout follower. The stories that are generated from this game are just wonderful, and it's always great to read other about other people's colonies too.\n\n[h1][b][u]Additional 12/17/18 thoughts[/u][/b][/h1]\n[quote]At the time I made this review, I couldn't think of any shortcomings the game has. Other than the game can be, and will be, unforgiving if you're not prepared for disasters. However, originally, I wanted to point out that the game can get tedious in the end game department\n\n So let me make one point that I admittedly did not describe in the original review: You have the choice of several scenarios for starting a game. You have the classic mode, where you start off with 3 survivors of a crashed space liner that was destroyed above the orbit of a \"in the sticks\" outer rim system. In this one, your goal is to guide these survivors off the planet, which there are multiple ways of achieving. Either by constructing a spaceship yourself, or treking the planet and finding one yourself. I want to point out that this is in fact entirely optional and you are free to do other things as you wish. Be it conquering the other communities that inhabit the planet or whatever.\n\nThis was something I also forgot to mentionl being a management sim, you will be managing your colonist's day to day lifes'. From setting their schedules, dictating what jobs they will be doing, and everywhere else in between. Their skills will help you determine what role they will be performing in their activities. For the most part, they are capable of being left to their own devices, but you can also force them to do certain tasks above others; this is also where the job prioirty system come in, so you can have a single colonist mine for minerals, cook, make clothing, and everything else in a elaborate order. Every colonist has their own backtory that gives them unique behavior. You might have a drooling braindead colonist who hates mundane work and has skills of 0 in everything, so you might have a use of using him as [strike]cannon fodder during a raid[/strike] a planting seeds in your farms, for example.\n\n The other two starts is starting off with a single dude with a handsome amount of supplies, and another one where you start off as a 5-man tribe and researching is far worst because of the nature of this start. These starts are regarded as being extra difficult. There's also the choice of player made scenarios on the workshop if you ever crave more. Plus you can customize them to your hearts content and upload them for others to enjoy too.\n\nSo, what are these tedious things I spoke of? Well, if you're determined to get off the planet, finding the components for the spaceship isn't easy. The research required will take a tremendous amount of time both in game and in real life hours. You have to essentially research the whole tree to get the required tech. To add to this, without the proper mods, it is not possible to actually tell your colonists to research because research is regarded as something that is a 'long term investment', which I don't particularly agree with. \n\nFinding the ship parts can be risky since you must trek out of the safely of your colony over long distances to get these items, which may or may not be guarded by strong guards in the maps they are in. So if your colonist dies, that's food and any weapons they have wasted, and there's no way of regaining the items back. \n\nI hope this supplementary review was helpul for you, the ever so hesistant buyer and similar so-sos who think the original review still wasn't conving you at throwing 35$ at this amazing game without seeing some of the silver linings of it as well.

Jesus, get me back to Sims 4, thanks. \n\nBut when I finally got the hang of it, I was *obsessed*. I'm a person where the narrative is the most important aspect in a game. In RimWorld, the story is primarily in your mind. You see your colonists fall in love, breakup, get sick, die, get their limbs amputated, get kidnapped by raiders, bond with animals, throw parties, get married. They would all seem like random, unimportant flavor events, but you get attached. I once had to stop playing this game because I had a TPK due to a colony getting the plague and having no decent doctor. It was awful. A game where colonists can become attracted to another due to comments on their body hair shouldn't be able to do that to you, but whoops, it can and it did. For me, anyways.  \n\nNow, you do have to be somebody who can lovingly, patiently build something beautiful and watch it get ripped apart by aggro natives named Black Human and Purple Bear. That's all part of the game. Every time you make a bad call, or overlook something that blows up in your face, or learn the hard way that parkas are actually important, or have to eat your pet foxes because you got the blight during the last half of the growing season, you learn. You learn and you (usually) do better next time. \n\nOther amazing events I have personally witnessed/experienced in RimWorld:\n\n* 30+ kill-trained Yorkshire terriers rip apart a 10 person raid\n* a warg named \"Murderous\" go on a killing spree because her bonded master died of infection\n* Randy Random, on a single game day, give me a meteorite of silver ore followed by a manhunter pack of cats\n* Accidentally amputating a totally-fine leg from a prisoner you're attempting to convert to your team, because you shot off their other leg \n* Two sisters romancing the same guy, only to dump him on the same day\n* A wedding in a field of corpses, post-unsuccessful raid\n\nJust, get this game, if this description sounds like your jam.

If you are playing to \"win\" right off the bat, then expect a rough time of it. Unlike most games, this has the most unique series of systems that work both for and against you depending on how well you play. Often times, you'll find yourself frustrated, other times you'll be miraculously saved by a sudden stroke of good luck. Due to the nature of a lot of things, it's easy even for an experienced player to miss something which causes issues. For example, in my current playthrough, I had some of my military off to save a downed person and recruit them. While they were gone, a pack of foxes showed up ready to rip up some colonists. No big deal, but then the caravan got ambushed. Okay, and while dealing with that, an infection on a wounded character drew my attention. Once my medic handled the infection and my caravan defeated the ambush I thought \"That was easy.\" Suddenly, colonists at home begin dropping like flies... I forgot the foxes! So yeah, lots of pretty severe injuries, a couple deaths, but nothing I could do but carry on.\n\nAnd that's ultimately why you should play this game. Not for \"winning\" but for the stories. I've often gone through the forums and loved reading the tales people told of how catastrophically (or humorously) things went. From drunk kittens to pyromaniac lovers burning down an entire base together, everyone who plays has their own unique tales to tell and when you play, you'll have your own as well. Like the dreaded \"Deerpocalypse\" that ruined one of my absolutely best runs. I had two hunters, one during the day and one during the night. Well, the one during the night was still hunting in the morning even though he was supposed to be going to sleep... well, he managed to anger an entire herd of 10+ deer. The entire herd. Every. Single. One. He did not survive. Meanwhile, my main hunter was down with plague so I had my other colonists form up to defend the base. The deer smashed through the doors, destroyed our turrets, and begin shredding my colonists one by one before running through the base to ensure the destruction of all. Many bled out, and with the medic down, plague took my hunter... Learned a valuable lesson that day... be VERY careful what you hunt, when, and how.\n\nAs you play, you'll find your own little tricks and quirks, your own preferences, and eventually you'll get to modding the game. I own over 400 games on Steam alone, and I can honestly say that Rimworld's modding community is on-par with that of Skyrim. If something frustrates you (like \"ruined fertilized eggs\"), chances are there's a mod that fixes it. If you want to add extra challenge, get something to add more micromanagement like Dubs Hygiene mod, or want to find a new experience then grab an overhaul mod and turn Rimworld into Borderlands.\n\nAnd best of all, no matter your playstyle, there's really no \"wrong\" way to play. Often, I try to build an actual civilization, city, or community and just see how long I can survive. I've never once built a ship, never even tried. But why leave when I can stay and some day, build the greatest city in the Rimworlds. Or die trying. Oh, and one more thing. I've still yet to get either DLC (want to, no money though) so all my experiences are from the base game and mods. It's easily my most played game with 1799 hours of playing at the time of writing this review.
