It's puzzles are very well designed, there are a truly shocking number of secrets to find around the world, and the environment is genuinely visually stunning. The game is far from perfect however. Over the span of a single hour, The Witness went from my all time favorite puzzle game ever, to something I genuinely couldn't imagine picking up again. It's end-game puzzles are either extremely obtuse, pointlessly frustrating, or both.\n\nMy advice to those considering buying The Witness are:\n\n1) Don't try to 100% the game. Hell, don't even try for 90%. Get as far as you can while still having fun. The moment you stop having fun is when you should put the game down, because it'll genuinely drive you insane.\n2) If you get stuck on a difficult puzzle, don't hesitate to look up a hint or solution. Chances are the game didn't communicate what you need to do in order to properly solve it, and there's no sense in ruining good experiences with nearly impossible puzzles.\n3) If you come across a puzzle with symbols you don't recognize, that's the game telling you to go somewhere else. While the game is technically \"open world\", it tries to lock some sections behind difficult and unfamiliar puzzles.\n4) The Witness has no accessibility options, so if you have a sensory impairment (specifically hearing, sight, or color blindness), many puzzles (including some needed to progress through the game) will be entirely impossible to solve without help.\n\nIf I could just forget the entire last section of The Witness, I would, and this would still be my favorite puzzle game ever. But I can't, so all I can do is recommend others not make the same mistake as me. Don't try to 100% the game. If you can buy it on sale, do it, and only play for as long as you can handle.

My incorrect expectations made my playsession worse than it might have been.\n\nThe similarity between Myst and The Witness is limited to the existance of puzzles on an island.  Myst is a mixture of Challenges, Narrative and Discovery, working towards and end goal.  The Witness is doing something different.\n\nI will say, The scenery in the witness is gorgeous. It's very clear that much time and effort was spent making this island a visual feast at almost every point. Checking out each new location was a really nice, and I looked forward to seeing the scenery in each place at first.\n\nThe problem is the narrative. There's almost none. There's some visual storytelling with the settings, and you can unlock some video or audio clips, but they are not a coherent story, mostly philosophical musings. This wasn't inherently a problem, except the game was compared to other games that do have a driving narrative. I was expecting to find one, and it's lack started to become a problem. I eventually beat the game, just to see if I was missing something, and honestly, I wasn't. There's no meaningful narrative here.\n\nNow we get to the puzzles. The game advertises having 500 unique puzzles. This is true, in the way that a 400 page Sudoku book has 400 unique puzzles. Really, it has 500+ variations of the same puzzle. The game did a quite good job of iteratively teaching you each flavor of the puzzle, and should be applauded for that. However, there were a few really odd and annoying ones that felt like bolts out of the blue.  The puzzles are generally not integrated into the environment at all. You could just as easily have done these at your kitchen table as in the world of the Witness.\n\nLack of narrative and Same-y puzzles highlights the other thing the Witness lacks... Discovery.  There's very little worthwhile to find. There's not narrative to unlock. Most of the Island can be viewed without solving most puzzles. You only reward is... More of the same puzzle... This can be fine in a game, if you are not expecting anything else. Unfortunately, I was, because of how it was sold.\n\nI ended up finishing the game out of desperation that it had a redeeming feature. Unfortunately the ending only made me spiteful. It was the philosophical equivalent of \"Isn't it amazing that after we've conditioned you to do a behavior 500+ times, you do it again?\"\n\nOverall I found the game to be a very pretty but disappointing experience", "timestamp_created": 1665423930, "timestamp_updated": 1667235662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702547550201416016", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146421801": {"recommendationid": "146421801", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993436447", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2441, "last_played": 1694890492}, "language": "english", "review": "As egregiously pretentious as its creator and void of even the faintest resemblance of a story, but the serene setting and clever \"AHA!\"-moments make this island worth exploring nevertheless.\n\nAll puzzles required for the default ending are entirely detectable and solvable independently, without any outside knowledge or guiding.

His 2008 game [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/]Braid[/url] remains one of my favourite games of all time, and has been critically praised practically across the board by critics and players alike. While Blow himself (teehee, blow himself) does come across as a little pretentious at times - and the internet has not been particularly forgiving towards his insistence to force metaphors and philosophical musings into his work and online discourse - Blow certainly knows how to create a mechanically satisfying puzzle.\n\nThe comparisons to [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/244430/realMyst_Masterpiece_Edition/]Myst[/url][/i] become almost immediately apparent, the player finding themselves stranded on a serene island, entirely alone. The Witness is much quicker than Myst to establish any kind of overarching mechanic, immediately serving you up the main entr\u00e9e: drawing lines.\n\n----------------------\u25cf\n\n[h1]It's a metaphor[/h1]\n\nJust like an all-you-can eat pizza buffet, The Witness continually serves you slight variations on the same pizza, and Mr. Blow hovers over the table requesting that you cut the pizza in increasingly convoluted ways. Except he never tells you how to cut the pizza, he just kinda pinpoints some key areas and keeps telling you you're wrong until you're right. This game is hinges largely upon the player figuring out what the puzzle wants you to do without explicitly explaining the methodology. This process of determination is captivating, and even though it sometimes feels like you're bashing rocks together, once the rules of the puzzle click, solving a puzzle is tremendously satisfying.\n\nAlso like a pizza buffet, you always pronounce without irony beforehand \"I'll never get tired of pizza\", and then find yourself staring in dread at the last two slices sitting mockingly on your plate that you took before your body surreptitiously decided that pizza was no longer its thing. The Witness took a good few pies to reach that point, but at around the 13 hour mark, every bite had started to taste the same, and it felt like I was overdue getting the cheque. That being said, I've never lasted 13 hours at a pizza buffet before, and The Witness was just as enjoyable the first hour as it was the twelfth.\n\nThe game also looks as good as a freshly delivered pepperoni pizza on a cold winter evening, nuff said.\n\nI think I want to order pizza.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1667815886, "timestamp_updated": 1667815947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666107892990112305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139779690": {"recommendationid": "139779690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438873507", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 976, "last_played": 1692708967}, "language": "english", "review": "best puzzle game ever made. beat it by yourself even if it takes you years", "timestamp_created": 1686312614, "timestamp_updated": 1686312614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659367084503173828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134686055": {"recommendationid": "134686055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882879625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 806, "last_played": 1662092574}, "language": "english", "review": "SO MUCH FUN!

No other game has given me as many headaches as this one, so take it easy if you try it. Also the price might be a little high, so maybe wait for it to be on sale like I did.\n\nThere's barely any story or soundtrack, it's just puzzle after puzzle with a pretty interesting way of introducing the mechanics, where they don't tell you anything and instead make you explore to find more information on how to solve them. That's exactly what I was looking for and why I was so hooked on the game. If you like puzzles and want to challenge yourself I highly recommend it.\n\nThe island is neatly split into different areas, each with a different mechanic introduced to the player. This is my favorite part of the game, because of how you have access to most of them, and are free to leave a puzzle to come back when you feel like it. All of them are intuitive to certain extend, but most of the time will be spent figuring out what the game wants you to do. Clear some areas to progress and that's it. Also, some puzzles require you to tell colors apart or listen carefully to in-game sounds, which might worsen the experience to people with certain level of colorblindness or hearing problems.\n\nA few spoilers ahead since the endgame and postgame are worth mentioning... The endgame part mixes some of the mechanics learned throughout the island, but makes it so the difficulty is mostly lost, and instead you have these simple puzzles that feel like they were made just to be as annoying as possible. Like making the interfaces move, or barely visible, or blink with bright colors, or spin around. Multiple times I had to step out and leave because of head pains. After that, if you decide to keep playing and go for 100%, the game wants you to clear all areas from before and play a boring version of Where's Waldo with dots and lines. There's not much to this part since most of the puzzles here consist of \"stand in the right place\". The timed challenge, on the other hand, was probably the part I enjoyed the most, challenging your memory and knowledge of the mechanics of the game while trying not to run out of time, makes me wish there was more of that.\n\nIn the end, this game will be stuck in my head for a while because of the experience, including the satisfactions and frustrations it gave me.", "timestamp_created": 1680929696, "timestamp_updated": 1680929696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617187142372131348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132022845": {"recommendationid": "132022845", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055152564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4510, "last_played": 1675060422}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended for puzzle game lovers, but with some reservations.

However, I revisited this game recently and despite expecting to be disappointed again, I actually found myself having a very fun time with this game. There are some very serious flaws with this game though and I think some of these flaws help explain my vastly different experiences with this game.\n\nOne of the largest flaws in this game for me was the story, or the lack thereof. There was so little narrative in this game that for most of my playthrough I honestly thought there wasn't supposed to be one, despite what the store page seems to suggest. What little story does exist is all locked behind hidden content near the end of the game and it's fairly brief and not well communicated, so even when I did finally encounter it, I found it pretty underwhelming and disappointing. There are also random thoughts from various philosophical thinkers hidden around the map to listen to as well, which don't provide any narrative, but do provide some interesting perspectives to consider, although I did sometimes find them hard to follow, especially while trying to explore or solve puzzles at the same time, and those that don't enjoy philosophy likely won't get much out of them.\n\nThe very creative puzzles that exist throughout the island of The Witness are where this game really shines. The general concept is fairly simple, and involves tracing a line through a maze from a start point to an end point, but the game quickly begins introducing a plethora of unique and interesting additional mechanics and rules, many of them making creative use of the environment to help you solve them. For the most part the game does pretty well at introducing new concepts to you with puzzles that gradually increase in difficulty in different areas, and the game does encourage you to revisit puzzles later if you don't have all the information you need to solve one. There were a few puzzles that were not communicated well or had unintuitive rules that were easy to forget, there's a few that are insanely slow or tedious to solve, and I also didn't enjoy some of the puzzles near the end of the game that relied on some annoying visual tricks that just made them really hard to look at (epilepsy warning for some of those puzzles as well). Thankfully those puzzles were by far the minority.\n\nIn addition to the regular puzzle panels that you find everywhere, there are hidden [spoiler]environmental puzzles[/spoiler] that are cleverly hidden throughout the island. These puzzles were my favourite puzzles to solve and I really enjoyed hunting for them and trying to figure out how to solve them. However, this brings me back to my first playthrough that I really didn't enjoy, as I never discovered these puzzles during that playthrough, and I think that highlights another major problem with this game. The open world nature of this game means you can easily miss things and end up missing crucial information on how to solve puzzles or even that some puzzles exist, leading to frustration or missing large parts of the game entirely. I think I just ended up doing things in a different order during my first playthrough and that resulted in me having a much worse experience. I think this game could have used more guidance to instruct players on where to go, or at least to indicate where good places to start are, as the freedom the game offers can definitely result in a worse experience overall.\n\nThe visuals in this game a very good. The island looks great and the sound design is very good as well. There's also many neat tricks of perspective hidden throughout the island, where looking at something from a certain angle reveals something neat you wouldn't have otherwise seen, which were pretty cool. The game also ran well and I didn't encounter any major issues during my playthroughs.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a fun puzzle game with a simple concept that is used in a large number of interesting and creative ways and a visually and auditorily stunning world to solve them in. Despite some puzzles that were poorly explained, tedious, or visually nauseating, a lack of direction which can sometimes lead to frustration, and an almost complete lack of narrative, I still enjoyed this game (the second time at least). This game definitely isn't for everyone, but if you like first-person puzzle games, I'd still recommend giving this game a try if you can get it on sale, as I think it gets more right than it gets wrong.", "timestamp_created": 1665951057, "timestamp_updated": 1665951057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596412539482116699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137373078": {"recommendationid": "137373078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077368605", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1682196873}, "language": "english", "review": "My new favorite game ever.

The world is shallow, you are weightless, and your actions mean little. Contrary to the store page summary, you do not 'regain your memory' or 'find your way home'. I don't think these are spoilers, because they are absent entirely - the subject of your memory or journey simply doesn't come up. Some Googling suggests that this is perhaps partly referenced in a secret post-game area, but: too bad! That's not the game! You have to put it in the main bit!\n\nThe story, if you can call it that, is sadly a pretentious bust. Recitals of abstracts from astronauts and 15th-century theologians do not a narrative make.

A recurring sin is that obfuscation is mistaken for acumen. The difficulty curve more generally is off-grade and poorly designed, with low levels of the satisfaction payoff that it should provide. The many layers of mechanics do not change that the core challenge is repetitive, and occasional dynamic features are clunky. \n\nIf I had paid full price for this I would be really annoyed.

The problem is that you get an  uneven experience when you combine all those things together. There are times when the game pleasantly hums along, but other times when it drags for long periods.\n\nYou start out in a somewhat restricted area, but once you pass this area, you're set loose on a semi-large open world island. You will find & solve puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. These are all line/maze puzzles (so you better enjoy those, as there are around 650 in the game). The island has various areas often containing series of puzzles unique to that area as well as some shared ones. The final puzzle in an area will open a yellow box which shoots a laser to the top of a mountain. You need to activate at least 7 of the 11 lasers on the island to get to the end game area, where you'll then proceed to hit some of the more annoying puzzles in the game.\n\nTo start with the list of issues is that the game implies that there is some grand mystery as to what is going on here. There isn't. In fact, there's no plot/story. The most you'll find are tape recorders containing pretentious nonsense. This ends with you being sent back to where you started and the puzzles all being reset. The secret ending is some guy wakes up in reality, falls over a bunch, touches some things and then taps some stuff with a spoon. Amazing!\n\nThere is no hand holding for the puzzles in this. The starting puzzles are tracing a line through the maze to the end. After this, you'll find puzzles with black & white dots, colored dots, small black hexagons, tetris shapes, sunburst symbols, etc. Some areas have short tutorial segments that teach you the basic rules for one of the rule sets. You will run into puzzles you're not currently able to solve, forcing you to go elsewhere. Most of this is fine except for the fact that the island takes a bit to get around and there is no map (except on the boat which functions as a sort of quicktravel system, except it's slower than running to your destination). The only real use for the boat is to get to one island which is separated from the main island.\n\nThe game has several issues with the areas and puzzles. It's difficult to talk about them as doing so provides minor spoilers. While you're often shown basic rules for puzzles, many of them have more advanced rules, which are completely reliant on you to figure out. Some of these require a bit of a stretch on your part. Some puzzles are based on visuals/sounds and even these will often require you to make a leap. If you fail some puzzles, the screen for that puzzle will turn off, forcing you to go back to a previous puzzle and re-solve it to get the screen to turn back on. These are usually ones based on you needing to notice something. The desert area is entirely based on luck as to whether you'll figure out how to solve the puzzles in that area. [spoiler]The solution for the puzzles only appear if you stand in certain spots, causing the sun to hit the screen in a way that it shows you how to draw the answer.[/spoiler] There was one area in the game (the jungle) where I was unable to start solving the puzzles because of stuff like this.\n\nThe worst puzzles in the game by far are the ones involving the tetris shapes, of which there are many. These don't start off too bad in the area you learn them, but you'll find plenty of puzzles which contain 3, 4, 5+ of these shapes on them. These aren't so much difficult as they're time consuming, requiring you to run through pretty much every possible permutation until you happen to stumble across the right one.\n\nThe environment also contains puzzles. Fortunately, these are all optional. If something in the environment looks like a circle (or can be combined/viewed to make it look like a circle), odds are pretty good it's a puzzle of some sort. The swamp area can be very annoying as it contains moving platforms which take a good 30+ seconds to very slowly move back and forth so you can get from one side to the other.\n\nThe Witness is an alright but uneven game. Sometimes you're going through puzzles at a good pace, other times you're stuck on one for a long while or have to go to some other area because you can't figure it out. Some puzzles make you feel smart when you figure out whatever the rule is or notice whatever it is you needed to notice. Other puzzles you'll know the rules, but are time consuming annoyances requiring you to try to fit things together in a ton of possible ways until you happen to find the one that actually works. Ultimately, the Witness goes on for far too long for what it is. The number of puzzles could've been cut in half and the game would've been far better off for it. It would've also helped to cut the time consuming brute force 4+ tetris piece puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1667138738, "timestamp_updated": 1667138738, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543844223022460938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145364146": {"recommendationid": "145364146", "author": {"steamid": "76561199543679041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1693463340}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm new to gaming, and a good friend recommended this game.

The only reward is more puzzles. You complete puzzles so you get to complete more puzzles so you can complete more puzzles. It is like a big Sudoku book, and once you complete one you get to complete 5 more. Each book twists the formula a bit, but by the end of the last Sudoku book you won't want to play Sudoku anymore. (Maybe this game is best experienced, where you complete one puzzle a day or only play when you have nothing else going on or only complete one section a week/month/year or something. I don't know...)\n\nIf you are someone who finds puzzles to be something that pads out a game, someone who sighs gently when they get stuck at a puzzle in a story game, or only played Portal 2 for the witty dialogue and story first and the puzzles second... then do not play this game.\n\nIf you do enjoy puzzles, then go ahead and play the game.

It\u2019s bad enough that I think going back to the first Professor Layton and solving all those stupid-ass sliding puzzles all over again would be a better experience lmao.\n\nI actually really enjoyed the first 60% or so of the game, but the other 40% completely soured the whole experience. It actually starts pretty fun, but the more I progressed, the less and less energy and motivation I had to keep going. The annoyance over some stupidly difficult and/or bullshit puzzles plus their general repetitiveness really starts to build up after a while. Oh, and speaking of horrible puzzles, thank you devs for putting a fucking puzzle with crazy flashing rainbow lights not soon after the ones that seems specifically designed to cause motion sickness, I greatly appreciated the headache \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nThere are also puzzles that are apparently literally unsolvable if you have color blindness or hearing impairments, which as we all know is always a very good sign of great game design lol\nAnyway, after some point I started straight up looking up every solution because I couldn\u2019t be bothered anymore. The sole thing keeping me going was some form of sunk cost fallacy. I kept hoping that the terrible parts were just temporary and that things would go back to being fun again, but they never did.\n\nOh and btw, did you know this game apparently has a story?? Well, I only do now because I googled it, since the game puts near zero effort into even implying it does. In fact, I bet most people only know there\u2019s supposed to be a story here because the devs came out on interviews saying so. Allegedly, the idea that there\u2019s narrative here is apparently \u201cimplied\u201d via the use of ridiculously-hard-to-see cassette tapes scattered around the map, which are also so well hidden I believe most sane players upon finding them would think they are just neat completely optional collectibles/easter eggs at best. I think I found 2 or 3 of them in my entire playthrough by the way, and there are [spoiler]over 40[/spoiler], so I guess you really need to go out of your way to spot them, huh? lol\nAgain, I\u2019m not sure how the players are supposed to figure out there is a story when the game literally doesn\u2019t tell you anything of the sort (or anything at all for that matter) since the game appears to have an intense aversion to telling you stuff directly. I guess being terrified of words must really be part of the game\u2019s minimalist philosophy lol\n\nHonestly, the game as a whole just feels very pretentious and seems to think it\u2019s smarter than it actually is (it really isn\u2019t lmao). From the tapes that contain readings of stuff said by philosophers, scientists and whoever else, to the minimalist puzzle design that is apparently somehow meant to make you question your \u201cideas\u201d and \u201cinterpretations of reality\u201d or whatever, everything just screams \u201chey guys, look at how smart my game is :))))\u201d. It\u2019s just too much. Way too much lmao.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t know what else to say at this point. In short, it feels as if the game was so busy being focused on being \u201cminimalist\u201d, \u201cphilosophical\u201d and \u201cartsy\u201d that at some point it completely forgot to actually be enjoyable. Maybe I\u2019m looking at this through the wrong perspective (heh), but I\u2019m also not willing to go back and experience anything from this game ever again, as I\u2019d rather go play something that I feel actually respects my time and me as a player.\n\nJust go play another puzzle game like The Talos Principle, it's a better use of your time and money. Or don\u2019t, maybe you\u2019ll like this shit lol.

I loved Jonathan Blow's talks on conferences and I love his philosophy, but this game.. It's just bad, sorry.\n\nNavigating through the game is pretty much impossible, you never know whether you're supposed to be solving a puzzle or not which can get you stuck for hours if you think you're supposed to solve a puzzle when you're not, or even days if you thought you were not supposed to solve a puzzle when you were.\nThe puzzles themselves, the graphics and the whole atmosphere is really good, but it's not good enough to overlook the basic failings of this game.\n\nThe navigation in this game is so very tedious and unintuitive. One could either spend years looking through the terrain trying to find every hidden thing or one could try to follow a sort of natural path instead which would lead to not only missing majority of the puzzles but also eventually into a dead-end. Getting into one such dead end would require a lot of backtracking and remembering where things were, which would be nearly impossible since the journey would've taken a few days by then and this game doesn't have anything particularly memorable.\n\nThat's on top of the fact that there is no save feature, only load. And the autosave overwrites the current loaded one, making it impossible to backtrack without solving the same puzzles over and over and over and over. And what's even worse, the autosave frequently (always, in my experience) happens in the exact moment you fail some sort of a time-based challenge, of which there are way too many to keep backtracking every time.\n\nThe core design of this game is something I personally just genuinely despise. It's not just puzzles. You have spend hours on finding the puzzles, then you have to spend hours on checking whether the puzzle is solvable without external clues, then you have to spend hours finding the clues. They could be visual clues, auditory clues, spacial clues, luminal clues. And you never quite know whether you need them or not, so you pick up on patterns that aren't there, or miss other patterns entirely. Once you've gone through this process for one line of puzzles, all of the remaining puzzles in that line are dead simple and boring, with no real reward.\n\nThe whole experience feels like the game trying to convince you it's really clever while actually only obfuscating the simple, boring puzzles. Or alternatively, from what I know of Blow's approach to developing this game, it feels like he saw potential in the simple concept of line puzzles and attempted to extract the deeper meaning and the emergent complexity into a puzzle game but ended up forcing incompatible concepts onto it just to complete what has been started.", "timestamp_created": 1684163837, "timestamp_updated": 1684163837, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528755366802215576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127734960": {"recommendationid": "127734960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975655237", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2418, "last_played": 1669962181}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable, tranquil, challenging too.", "timestamp_created": 1669954339, "timestamp_updated": 1669954339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528741598129272461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139250906": {"recommendationid": "139250906", "author": {"steamid": "76561199119389723", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1316, "last_played": 1685909388}, "language": "english", "review": "A game you should see. not play.

It makes you learn by doing, and once it finishes building that basis it reinforces it through harder and harder puzzles, questions that are very interesting to answer, and it truly makes you proficient. The witness, to quote electron delta's review of this game, asks you to \"Stop looking, start seeing.\" It does a good job at it making you able to see a solution very quickly.\n\nHowever, this is also one of the worst puzzle games I have played. Some of the puzzle types require you to sit in just the right location at just the right time, others are one-offs that require thinking in an entirely different way for a challenge puzzle. The game promotes not needing all of the lasers to enjoy the game, but requires all [spoiler]eleven of them to access the challenge area[/spoiler]. The game's downsides are not enough to hurt the positives it does.\n\n[h3]From here on out, there will be spoilers. Read at your own risk[/h3]\n\n[spoiler]There is one more horrible thing this game does, the environmental puzzles. The moment when you first see them, high atop the mountain looking down at the river, the panel next to it. The environmental puzzles add such a good dimension to the game. However going for all 135 of them is not a fun experience, some of them you need to align the clouds just right to see the line in the negative space, others you do the same but with trees, the red and purple flowers in front of the castle form puzzles, they are truly everywhere. This hunt was a truly maddening experience, the obelisks help but it has a lot of \"right place, right time, eyes on a swivel for anything remotely resembling a circle.\" And all of this is without touching on the environmental puzzle that takes 57 minutes to complete. And while you wait for the full moon to cross over that theatre screen and become eclipsed, you hear a GDC talk about easter eggs and about looking too deeply into things, all this is while you are solving an easter egg itself! The environmental puzzles are the best part of this game and the one I would most like to remove.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]The Challenge, the record player, and the puzzles needed to unlock it are the truest final boss to this game. The cavern is filled with new puzzle types and ones that use mechanics in new and interesting ways, it makes you truly think again about everything you've learned so far. And the challenge? It forces you to solve puzzles sight unseen, with around 7 minutes to solve around 20 puzzles. Using an early pathfinding puzzle with two hexagon dots to define the maze you traverse later on it s very good decision. The puzzle panels which ask you to spot the fake reinforces the \"start seeing\" mentality. Your rewards for completing this is the solution to truly leave this place. What does that \"3-2-1\" mean? Why does it undo my progress? And then hopefully you see it, you are able to touch the sun and unlock the final ending.[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, The Witness is a beautiful puzzle game that tests the player's skills and patience.

There are definitely many pros as well as cons, so I'm gonna try to lay it all out and I'll leave it up to you as to whether or not its worth your time:\n\nPros:\n\nThe game itself is slow and calculating to the point where it teaches you the mechanics of the puzzle systems piece by piece, slowly building upon whatever you've previously learned and expanding it to vast proportions. \n\nIf you ever find yourself unsure of how to proceed because it seems the game just hasn't provided you with enough information to solve the puzzles, there is a chance the solution to the puzzles can actually be found in the environment around you. Some puzzles require you to adjust the camera angle just right so you can see the solutions illuminated in the sun's light, while other puzzles may require you to raise or lower the room's overall water levels so you could see the solutions in the water's reflection.\n\nThere is zero background music, giving you the player a vast natural ambiance to help you focus with zero distractions. \n\nThe game is long, and brilliant. If you've got nothing but time on you're hands and wish for something that would serve as a simple distraction, this game would be the best damn thing for you. It is so easy to loose yourself in this game, forget the world around you and immerse yourself in the shear intricacies of life within this game. \n\nCons:\n\nThis game is super intricate with it's environmental hints and clues to solving the puzzles, so intricate in fact that anybody who isn't excessively observant enough may find themselves in a situation where they may begin to feel inadequacy towards their own capabilities. \n\nThe game-play is long and slow, so much so that if you're a gamer like me who plays games with the intent to record and upload for the amusement of an audience, I can not recommend this game for you. It's too long, too quiet for audience interest, and while it may seem like the game has some intriguing lore or story of some sort, it's never properly explained and leaves the players feeling cheated in some way. Like you've arrived at the scene of some great apocalyptic disaster, and there's nothing and nobody left to explain to you or help you understand what happened. \n\nSo, all in all it is a good game.

The other 50% are the reason I am not leaving a positive review. The non environmental puzzles take SIGNIFICANTLY more time akin to staring at a Sudoku puzzle trying to figure out the \"one correct\" solution rather than searching the beautiful surroundings for clues. If you are someone else who has played this game I am specifically lamenting the block puzzles being put seemingly everywhere after they are introduced and seem to be padding the game up until the end.\n\nOpening the last area has one of the more cool environmental puzzles but this leads to a series of non environmental puzzles to beat the game that I can't bring myself to complete. They are the same puzzles you complete the entire game but with annoying \"broken parts\" just to slow you down entering in the solutions.

The Witness is a unique experience, and I've never played another game quite like it. On the surface, it's a puzzle game, but there's so much depth to the world and the puzzles. The community is very much against spoilers, and so am I, so I'll try to structure my review with that in mind.\n\nYou spawn in a chamber with a simple puzzle: connect the starting circle with the end of the puzzle. The starting area kind of serves as a tutorial for how The Witness puzzles work in general. As you explore more of the island, the puzzles become more complex, with different rules being added to them. These rules and patterns recur throughout the game, and sometimes combine to create even more complex and challenging puzzles. The game does an incredible job at teaching you the new rules by starting with very simple puzzles containing the new rule, and then moving on to slightly more complex versions. I never truly felt lost with a puzzle, except for a couple of them in one zone, where I feel like that zone's rule could have been taught a little better.\n\nAlso littered throughout the island are several hidden puzzles that require you to be standing in specific locations and looking at specific angles. They're super satisfying to find and solve, and I still haven't found all of them, despite being a speedrunner for the game. Another thing you'll find are little recordings, all of which are philosophical and scientific. I was always quite fascinated by what the people had to say. They added just that little bit of extra wonder to the world.\n\nIf I were to rate The Witness on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be a solid 9, maybe a 9.5. It's extremely satisfying, and I always want to come back for more. There are a few things that keep it from being perfect, but I can't even begin to describe what would need to change. I think the only change I would want to see that would give it a 10/10 is for (spoilers ahead) [spoiler]the swamp area to have its rules explained a little better - the puzzles create an ambiguous understanding of the rule that could go one of two ways.

I find this game similar essence of the Talos principle, the only difference is that Talos gives us a narrative, a reason to continue so we can understand more, and learn more. In the Witness you have actors reading quotes from famous philosophers and a very tiny narrative that is explained only at a secret ending. \n\nI have played the witness a total of 3 times\n-first when it came out, played for 4 hours got bored and left. \n-Second time was 3-4 years later, I wanted to play, and enjoy the game. And for a time I did, but then I resorted to guides as I found some of the puzzles just annoyingly tedious and lacking fun. Finished the game with guides. And felt... meh. \n-Third time was this week, wanted to achieve 100% in the game. I came close until I returned to the tedious and annoying puzzles. And once again I resorted to guides as I found myself hitting a spiky brick wall that leads to an even spikier brick wall. So, I finished the game again feeling meh. Didn't even 100% the game. \n\nI love puzzles. One of my first games was Myst so I find them incredibly enjoyable. But The Witness lacks in engaging the player whilst also not caring about the player. You can spend two-hours on a single section of puzzles and feel as if you've just clocked out of a shift from an office job. Now that's not me saying I want confetti and someone petting my shoulder and whispering \"good job\".  Because I don't want that. I want to feel enjoyment and purpose in solving these puzzles. Which you do not get. \n\nWhat you do get is a false purpose, once you activate one of the lasers you feel a goal has been set by the game. The mountain. The final location. But that isn't true, you can go there from the start of the game. and enter after 7 lasers. Once you enter the mountain it feels like a test that makes sure you remember every rule so far, while twisting them to make them fresh again, It doesn't succeed in that, what it does is make them even more annoying.  So that's when I pulled the guide and rushed through the puzzles, couldn't be arsed anymore. Once I got to the elevator I just felt empty and tired. If this is by design, then good job, you have bored and annoyed me in my free time. \n\nThis may come off as only a negative review, so let's jump to the positive things.\n  -The game is utterly beautiful, every part of the island feels, looks, and sounds amazing. \n-Some parts of the island are fun, like the castle, and the desert.  And that's it for me. The rest felt just either too fast or too annoying.\n-Hearing Ashley Johnson whispering philosophy in my ear makes my fucking day. This game unlocked a new kink for me. \n\nSo back to our problem, The Witness fails in being... well... a game. It feels like more of an experience than actually playing a game. Every time I go back to it I feel as if I'm experiencing something. Not necessarily something good. The game's true story is that you are a developer testing the game (Super meta). The secret ending is you coming out of the machine fully insane and obsessed with the line puzzles. And that's it. The voice actors are also devs of the game, but that's technically not canon. If you go on youtube and hear all of the audio logs. You will find them commenting about the logs and the game.  Proving they are aware of the island and you. But because the narrative was scraped. We are left with an empty story and a pointless adventure. \n\nAnd so, the essence of Talos comes here.  A game that acts more like a game than an experience, Talos gives the player a goal and a mystery to solve. And they give you answers that fit. In the Witness, you can ask all you like but you won't get an answer. \n\nIf you only want to solve line puzzles for hours and hours. Go ahead, play this. But if you are looking for something more than line puzzles and philosophy quotes. Go and play the Talos principle.\n2/5", "timestamp_created": 1677001140, "timestamp_updated": 1677313995, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518025577068328857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137380722": {"recommendationid": "137380722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103583536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1682870172}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, I was really excited for this puzzle game.

This issue shouldn't be overblown--the greatest challenges in the game have little to do with IQ and a great deal to do with stretching your mind a bit and seeing things in a different way.  Nevertheless, some aspects of the game feel a little bit like the kinds of puzzles you might see on an IQ exam.\n\nMost importantly, though...\n\n3.  People in a hurry.  This is the big one.  The game expects you to take a leisurely approach:  put down your copy of Marcel Proust, sip a glass of wine, stroke your chin a bit, and enjoy slowly turning around the puzzles thrown at you.  You *will* get stumped on occasion.  And if you're eager to make quick progress every time you sit down to this game, you will probably be frustrated.\n\n*  *  *\n\nJust as an aside...the various messages have a similar arc to them.

There are people who adore the game, and there are people who hate it. There are people who view it as a pinnacle of the artform, and there are people who think it's pretentious garbage. Me? Personally? I find The Witness to be a brilliant game. But you might disagree.\n\nThe majority of The Witness is solving puzzles. A vast majority. They are good puzzles. They are thoroughly engaging and clever puzzles. Some of the twists on mechanics are outstanding and mindbending. Almost all the puzzles are designed in a way that make solving them impossible unless you understand the mechanics. They're the investment of the game, and they're truly fantastic. An amount of the puzzles, unfortunately, are designed in such a way that kind of throw colorblind people (in certain, specific areas) and tone deaf (or deaf people at all) people under the bus. Even if you aren't one of these, there is a possibility to get hung up because you don't pick up on what the designer wants you to pick up on, whether it be the perception of shapes, the perception of mechanics, or perception of the world. These, while often fun, put a lot of expectation on the player to perceive things like light and sound the same way as the designer, which is quite a burden for the player to bear. (Also, the ship puzzle sucks. You'll understand if you play it.)\n\nDo you like puzzles? If you don't, do not play this game.\n\nOne thing I greatly appreciate about The Witness is how much of a learning experience it is. Many puzzles are based on rethinking mechanics you already thought you understood in completely different scenarios. In certain moments, I audibly exclaimed something like \"Oh man!\" at the new way I looked at things.\n\nThe other percentage of the experience consists of walking, and listening to audio tapes, and occasionally watching a video. The audio tapes are usually some thoughtful quote for you to chew on. The videos range from really interesting to... uncomfortable, honestly (four of them are neat, two of them are... just strange.) The Island itself (the location of the game) is colorful and beautiful. There are plenty of nice sights to see, and mystery to ponder, even if theres no real answer. It's a little boring, all of it, but it's pensive quiet time, and serves as a set for the secret second half of this game.\n\nBecause there's this other half to that percentage. I have a love-hate relationship with this half of the game.  Without spoiling anything, I will call them \"secret puzzles\". They are not necessary to complete the game, and serve (unfortunately?) no mechanical purpose other than gratification. A lot of them are easy to find, but many are so out of nowhere and convoluted that it feels more like a directionless scavenger hunt. It might be the case that these secretive puzzles are intended to bring together players outside of the game to trade secrets (a la Zelda on the NES, or PT), in which case, the game succeeded. It's likely that it's the case that these are part of a kind-of meta narrative (something that becomes evident when watching these videos in the game)And that being said, some of these secret puzzles are jaw-dropping, even if I couldn't sleuth them out on my own. They are creative and unique, evoking those \"Oh man!\" responses frequently. But there is still that dissonance. \n\nThe Witness is a good game. If you don't like puzzles, don't play it. If you do like puzzles, maybe play it. \n\n(This review kind of sucks but I wanted to say something.

As has been noted, it is a fiendishly difficult puzzler.  It has garnered many negative reviews, mostly from people expecting it to be a puzzle-adventure game, which it is NOT.  It has suffered in it's comparisons to Myst, but it really isn't like that at all.\n\nEVERY SINGLE PUZZLE consists of drawing line-path through a grid or symbol.  Every one.  Nothing else.   Every interaction with the world is triggered by drawing a line-path through a grid or symbol.  You cannot interact with the world in any other way.  The environment itself often plays a key role in the puzzles, whether it be clues to the puzzle lurking in the environment, or driving the solution of the puzzle itself.\n\nYet... and here is why the game is great and totally worth the $40 price of admission... something subtle starts to happen to you as you complete puzzle after puzzle.   HOW you solve the puzzles -- the thought process required arrive at a solution for each -- starts to take on meaning and become metaphoric.  There is a palpable sense of MEANING in the puzzles you solve, and that is reflected and reinforced by ALL the environment details and art and media snippets found on the island.

It's easy enough to appreciate getting the solution after struggling with a puzzle for a while. Games like Portal make great use of this. Portal is about finding the solution that will let you move on. \n\nThe Witness is different. The Witness is a game about understanding puzzles. Understanding a puzzle is about more than just finding a solution. It's about knowing how the puzzle works. It's about knowing what makes a solution a solution.  \n\nYou could be shown the answer to many of the puzzles in the game and be immediately and totally stuck on the next puzzle. Why? Because you didn't [i]understand[/i] the puzzle. You don't understand why that solution is a solution. Without that knowledge, you cannot move on to the next puzzle.

I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is.

That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.

There's no pointing arrow. There's not even text, save for the subtitles of various unrelated audio logs you'll find on the island, which are mechanically (but not thematically) unrelated to what you're going through. The Island and its puzzles, via design and balancing, are everything at the same time: they're your tutorial; they're your test; they're your guidance. The whole island is your puzzle, your chest to crack open and treasure to pillage. Progress is your goal, your tool and your reward at the same time, one thin line after the other.\n\nAfter a brief and enclosed area that teaches you the very basic mechanics of interacting with puzzles, the world will open its gates and start teaching you how to progress via the puzzles themselves. Each area will present you with new rules without stating them, together with easy puzzles that serve the purpose of letting YOU, the player, the guest of the island, infer the rules on your own. As you progress through the areas you will start to understand the game's language, what it tells to you, and your mind will start deconstructing a new puzzle or even rule before you even start actively thinking about it. \nBut where do I go in this game? What do I do? You do line puzzles. The world will let you know how. The world will let you know where to go. Without saying a word, of course. Go out and explore.

It won't be for everyone, but for players who want something cereberal, rewarding and surprising, and an experience which doesn't lead you by the hand and show you exactly what to do at every turn, get it get it get it! 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1489051948, "timestamp_updated": 1489051948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 145, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868957996368408203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29733877": {"recommendationid": "29733877", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993078928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1307, "last_played": 1486349000}, "language": "english", "review": "I was really on the fence about this one... But in the end I have to just ask myself, how much did I enjoy playing The Witness? The answer is... Not so much. But I am quite aware this game is a quality product, shockful of stuff to look at, and beautiful words and imagery. It's a bit heartbreaking to give it the thumbs down then. It obviously took a lot of thought and effort to design those puzzles, repetitive as they may be...\n\nI'll start with what I enjoyed: The island is beautiful, colourful, and meticulously crafted, filled with details to find with your eyes and marvel at. There is at least 1 hour of quality video in the game, metaphysical and philosophical speeches and movie clips that I wouldn't have watched if they weren't in the game. I enjoyed those. I enjoyed the theme of the game and the feeling of awareness it's trying to convey. This appeals to me tremendously.\n\nHowever, it's a puzzle game... And while I don't generally enjoy puzzle games, the first Myst game is one of my favorite games. Just last month I was watching a conference from one of the guys who made Myst, and he said one of the core concepts of Myst was \"No arbitrary puzzles\". Indeed, in Myst, most puzzles make sense within their world. They are different from one age to the other, from one room to the other, they feel like they belong where they are... It's almost as if you're trying to understand how the people who inhabited these ages lived in order to solve the puzzles...\n\n... However, The Witness is an ode to arbitrary puzzles. An ode to one very repetitive arbitrary puzzle. It developes an incredibly clever Sudoku/coding/pathfinding mini-game that you have to decode, and puts it EVERYWHERE. Sure, you often need to observe the superbly clever environments to figure out the code to these \"puzzles on a pad\", but in the end, almost all of your time in The Witness will be spend looking at these pad puzzles. There are hundreds of them.\n\nOne of the intelligent things The Witness does is teach you its complicated puzzle-solving language. It does so magnificiently. I thought that, once I'd learned the language, I'd feel great and power through the puzzles.  Nope. Knowing the code is not enough. The game keeps hammering you with more complex forms of the same puzzle, with arbitrary difficulties thrown in. Often times you know exactly what you are supposed to do, yet you have to spend 10 minutes doing it, trying going different paths and whatnot... It's hard to explain without spoiling the puzzle system itself... But that's the key of my displeasure; you understand you're supposed to split these coloured pips from these coloured pips, you have to trace a path through it all... But the path never works, it's blocked by various things, it's annoying. The puzzle isn't hard because of the awesome code you decoded, it's hard because of the \"pathfinding\" element. And that element is always the same, over and over and over. It quickly became tiring, frustrating.\n\nI wanted to love this game. And in many ways I do. I thank it for the journey and its philosophy. But by the 15th hour, I couldn't take the puzzles anymore. I'd recommend The Talos Principle over The Witness. Like Myst, The Talos Principle also had the benefit of having an intriguing story. And some of its philosophy was engrossing also. I also hit puzzle fatigue in The Talos Principle, and it also suffered from arbitrary puzzles... The two games share that problem when compared to Myst. But it seemed less extreme with Talos, especially because it was backed by story.\n\nSo in the end, I don't necessarily \"not recommend\" The Witness. But you really, REALLY have to be a puzzle-game fan in my humble opinion.\n\nI do commend it for doing what it wants, with no compromise. I tip my hat off to the team behind this challenging and visionnary game. This alone almost makes me want to give the game a thumbs up.  But... I didn't really feel good playing the game because of its puzzles...", "timestamp_created": 1486350488, "timestamp_updated": 1486350602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 309, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867908596992492676", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32331384": {"recommendationid": "32331384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043784900", "num_games_owned": 1436, "num_reviews": 254, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 880, "last_played": 1497075560}, "language": "english", "review": "The easiest way to tackle a problem is more often to explain it as simple as possible, and the most succinct and fair way I could ever express the appeal of The Witness is to ask yourself: \"What/Who are you witnessing?\"\n\nWhen I look at an artsy game that knows it will appear provocative, or here in The Witness of being so pretentious it deflates any meanings made by others, I often ask why a developer would go to such lengths, either by gameplay or by story, to make something so unclear. The only answer I can accept is it's about introspection, not of a revelation inflated by the ego of the creator(s) but about the player's own understanding.\n\nIn short, to play The Witness is to witness how far you can manage the intangible hamster-wheel in your head spinning before you bail out with an answer or you give up to spin the wheel some other day. If you don't mind the struggle, then The Witness can truly be an enlightening experience it wants you to believe it is.\n\n[h1]\"How Do You Know What I Know You Know, You Know?\"[/h1]\n\nIn order to discuss what works and what doesn't work for puzzles, I have to talk about WHAT skills the puzzles test, not HOW they test your skills to their limits. I would compare this section to describe the themes of a book rather than spoiling the plot, so the experience itself is not tarnished and you can understand what I mean. \n\nFor the Witness, there are three core tasks you perform:\n\n1) Metacognition (\"How do you know what you know?\")\n2) Spatial Awareness (\"Frame-of-Reference\")\n3) Apophenia (\"The Tetris Effect\")\n\nAs someone who learned about childhood cognitive development, I think the term metacognition, \"to think beyond your own thinking process,\" is the simplest way to describe The Witness's biggest selling point. In order to get anywhere in the game you have to think about the hows and whys you reached an answer, and once you check your assumptions to be correct you have mastered the lesson. \n\nIn terms of gaming, imagine a Metroidvania where you are given all the abilities from the start but you're never told how to use them (i.e. Toki Tori 2). There are no arbitrary requirements like getting the Super Bomb; the challenge is not having the answer to the problem, but figuring out how the tool works as well as when and where it is to be used. That process is how the Witness works, and like any proper Metroidvania game you can sequence break it if you understand the rules.\n\nUnlike the unfair Myst comparison which operates by fiddling with various puzzles with little, if any, instruction, ALL puzzles in The Witness operate under the one explicit rule in an open environment: You draw a line from a circle to an exit-way. \n\nTo keep this idea from stagnating, the puzzles add new modifiers that either change how you read a screen or they incorporate an awareness of your surroundings for clues. This idea holds true not only for the environment itself but also the screens you work with, drawing your attention to more than into a flat-screen.\n\nAs for the open-world design of the puzzles, it is effective and not confusing because every location on the island tests one major skill, which is indicated on the boat's map, and the optional challenges (and the town) are there to persuade you to go explore elsewhere. The result naturally rewards the repetition of learning the codes/rules by clearing up misconceptions and the interconnected nature of all the puzzles sharing the same core gameplay helps you find connections.\n\nThis interconnected awareness on a simple idea is what many would probably describe as \"The Tetris Effect\" (another example is the Number 23 movie). You see the repeating patterns, the rules and the answers everywhere by the mere repetition of a simple task like drawing lines, which instills a schizophrenic view of the false appearance of meaning that only a video-game could make you believe is real.\n\nWhen all of these tasks blend so effortlessly together, the sense of reward you find makes the struggle worth the time, and in that regard The Witness succeeds at conveying ALL rules with zero written or verbal communication in a short amount of time.\n\n[h1]95% of the Time Right Isn't Good Enough[/h1]\n\nHowever, and this is a black mark on an otherwise flawless puzzle game, there are challenges that go too far to be reasonable for all players. You may be thinking I pulled a random number from nowhere, but out of 532 screen puzzles I required help for 31 either by a hint (or an answer) from a guide when I understood the rules or by having the right \"frame-of-reference\" to do the puzzle. \n\nThe latter problem is best explained by the controls; you are locked on your screen to do a puzzle. If you unclick it to get a better position, then your solution is undone. For this issue, some may argue that I could jot them down; however, it's the pixel-perfect angles for a few problems that I could not stand. As for fixing this issue, it would be nice if the game took a page from TRI by letting you deselect the cursor and move. (Yes, it would break some puzzles but I rather not let the limitations of the controls confuse players.)\n\nThe first problem is more a subjective concern as there are some puzzles that will be impossible for people hard of hearing, colorblind, prone to seizures/epilepsy, motion-sickness and/or have poor visibility due to the game's resolution or their eyesight. The frequency of these challenges varies by locations as well as their overall difficulty, which complicates an experience that teaches solely by observation.\n\nAs a result of both issues in a game with no guidance, this 5% of uncertainty, which I feel is being generous, is too much to instill doubt in the player's ability to complete every puzzle. \n\nThis is why I think the game tests the limitations of what you know by testing all learning styles, rather than focusing solely on one. As someone who learns best by seeing and by interacting, I struggled where a more abstract person would find it trivial; the result may be vice-versa, different and/or equal to another type of challenge.\n\nI would let this problem slide if not for how the game, not the story, ends.\n\n[h1]At the Mountains of Madness[/h1]\n\nYou may be wondering if you have not played why I discredit any meaning or narrative being real. It's because, contrary to what Mr. Blow says on Steam, to 100% complete this game it does not respect your time nor is every puzzle different.\n\nBy far the most absurd optional puzzles are the two-hour long videos you have to watch, and one is over an hour long. These aren't rewards as you have to watch them to complete a puzzle, and all six videos range from Richard Feynman to a guy who can't recognize time to a privileged woman asking you to give up on ambitions. Like the puzzles themselves, it's all about perspectives and discrediting any universal meaning behind them. \n\t\nOn top of the 532 puzzles, there are over 140 more you will have to do which do not teach you anything new. These puzzles, in contrast to the ones that teach you something new, are busy-work for only the most ambitious of fans.\n\nHowever, even if you only are interested in figuring out all the rules, the end-game content at the Mountain has the most asinine puzzles. It's a shame because between having the most frustrating puzzles there are also a few worth trying. This sudden fall of quality isn't a fair-challenge, especially when it introduces new health hazards, which will quickly erode any player-trust left. It is so sudden that it will make you wonder if the game has spiteful sentiments towards people who don't get it.\n\n[h1]I Love it; I Absolutely Hate it[/h1]\n\nWhen I think about my time with The Witness, I am reminded of how much I despise Dark Souls 1 after the drop in quality after arriving at Anor Londo; do you judge the game as a whole for the moments of bliss, or the fumbling fall to the end?

It didn't take very long for me to feel frustrated and underwhelmed with this game. At first I wanted to give it a mixed/neutral score (ignoring the fact that Steam lacks the common sense to give us that feedback option). My general impression was that the ideas were creative, but the execution came up short.\n\nOne of the challenges that either the player or The Witness has to overcome (depending on your point of view) is that the rules aren't going to be explained. If your idea of a good puzzle game is knowing your objective, and just demonstrating what you know, then this game isn't for you. Or is it?\n\nWhat I would argue is that The Witness was very deliberately designed to do something besides just be a game. The witness ISN'T about puzzle mechanics. It's about problem solving in general. It's about facilitating the change that takes place in your brain when you don't know; don't have a clue, but start asking questions; start testing ideas.\n\nThe Witness wants you to learn how to think for yourself. Not because your avatar has a backstory. Not because there's an achievement to unlock, or some time to kill, or even profit to be had in the business behind it. It just understands that thinking is very much the most fundamental part of being human. And maybe, fewer and fewer people are actually doing it (whether it be a side effect of technology, flaw in social and educational systems, or some other cause or influence).\n\nPlayed correctly (without a walkthrough, video, backseat gamer, etc.), the Witness seeks to cultivate your desire to confront what you don't understand, to foster confidence in your inate ability to figure things out, and to instill passion for knowledge by appreciating your own progress.\n\nThe Witness is not a conventional game. Expect to be disappointed if that is the lens through which you try to judge it. I wish everyone had the open-mindedness and patience to play it.

Many reviews contain spoilers at some level (including the top reviews)! The forums and community hub also do (even though there is a Spoiler subforum, there are still spoilers in the other sub-forums). I will try to keep this review as spoiler free as practical.\n\n[u][b]First and foremost[/b][/u], The Witness manages to evoke even in a seasoned gamer like me, the sense of wonder I felt when playing games like Myst for the first time.\n\nThat is, among other reasons, because the game is a gorgeous piece of virtual art. Most of us are no longer easily impressed by pretty, expensive, mass produced graphics. This is more than that.\n\nWhile indeed technically excellent, the world (well, island) of The Witness is crafted in a way that feels something like walking around in a masterpiece painting (or series of paintings, as there is considerable environmental variety). Aside from the overall beauty, there are so very many wonderful details to admire. I don't think I have played any other first person 3D game that approaches this level of artistry.\n\n[u][b]Second, the gameplay[/b][/u], which consists primarily of exploration, puzzle solving, and a sort of scavenger hunting is surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nThe classic CD-ROM game Myst is perhaps the closest comparison and the biggest inspiration for this game, but The Witness is much more accessible, less frustrating, more beautiful, and, I think, more rewarding an experience.\n\nIt is a game of epiphanies, repeatedly producing quite nice feelings of accomplishment in ways that not many games do, even most puzzle games.\n\nThis is largely because the puzzle solving mechanics are never directly explained to you, but the world presents you with ample visual and symbolic clues to make your own inferences. This is the core design principle, and, to me, indeed a key selling point.\n\nBased on preview videos I saw initially, I had significant reservations about the seemingly simplistic puzzle mechanic. Simple it is indeed, but it is presented in such clever, varied, often challenging ways that it never really felt tedious or overly repetitive to me (although, I am quite good at puzzles). And, yes, there is somewhat more to this than solving 2D puzzles on flat panels.\n\nGoing into more details about the mechanics would spoil the sense of discovery that is the highlight of the game, so I will not, but I will say that this game will exercise your mind in a wide variety of wonderful ways.\n\nIt's not an easy game. While getting to the \"easy\" ending can be done without much effort, the game holds substantial challenges for those that wish to take them on.\n\nDuring my playthrough, I ended up using three sheets of graph paper and taking numerous private screenshots for future reference. It's [i]that[/i] type of game - the type of game (almost) nobody has dared to make in decades.\n\nIt takes maybe a 10-20 hours to reach the easy ending, and another 10-20 to reach complete the second achievement. However, there is quite a bit more to do, and doing all of it, even with a guide, would take quite a lot longer.\n\nSo, to those of you wondering about the $40 price point, the game has [i]plenty[/i] to offer to justify it.\n\n\n[h1]Conditional Recommendation[/h1]\n\nI highly recommend The Witness to the right audiences. The trick is determining whether or not you are the right audience for the game.\n\n[u]Reasons you might [i][b]not[/b][/i] like The Witness[/u]:\n* You have a sensory deficiency (colorblind or deaf) - see Sensory section below for more details\n* You dislike puzzles.\n* You dislike thinking.\n* You want your game mechanics clearly explained to you rather than having to figure them out based on clues/cues.\n* You need games to have a coherent, \"traditional\" story. What is the game about? If you really must know, it's about [spoiler]epistemology[/spoiler]\n* You would be overly uncomfortable exploring a mostly static world with only some environmental audio, but mostly no music.\n* You want to be able to do everything in the game without help (note: help is not necessary for the achievements, though some may need it).\n* You want to be able to do everything in the game in a reasonable amount of time (note: again, not a problem for the achievements)\n(including this in spoiler tags so others do not inevitably point it out in comments)\n* You can't stand [spoiler]being \"lectured\"[/spoiler] on [spoiler]religion/science/philosophy/art/whatever.[/spoiler] This isn't a required part of the game. If you don't like that sort of thing, you can ignore it, but if you do, you will be [spoiler]partially \"missing the point\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere is a common complaint that, despite what I said, and despite the overall positive reception, that the core mechanic of the game (drawing a line) is too repetitive. I worried about this initially, but I after having played the game, I think it's fine and surprisingly well done, though perhaps not without some arguable flaws. I guess I have to mention that here because it's such a common complaint, but ultimately if this sounds like a concern to you, the only way to find out if it works for you or not without spoiling the game is to actually play the game for yourself.\n\nBesides these warnings, I highly recommend it to anyone else.\n\n[h1]Misc. Notes[/h1]\n\nThe game is actually \"optionally\" DRM free. The Steam version can be run without Steam, if necessary (although mixing offline/online may cause problems).\n\nBuying it at the Humble Store will give you a choice between DRM-free [i]only[/i] or Steam key [i]only[/i]..\n\nThe game looks nice on High settings, for which you would need to meet the moderately high recommended requirements. I haven't tried it in lower settings, but I've seen some people say that the game loses a lot when settings go lower, so the experience won't be as nice.\n\nIs this game \"indie\"? I would say so. Here's a relevant quote from Jonathan Blow (from Reddit AMA):\n\n\"I am not disappointed with anything from the game. If we had shipped it early, I would have been -- I would have stories like you hear from most game developers, \"well, we originally wanted to do X but we had to de-scope the game because it was obviously too ambitious\", or, \"we tried to do Y but we just didn't get it right and then we had to ship\". No, that is not how we work here. We built an ambitious game and we made sure everything was good and then we shipped it. When you aren't being forced to ship by a publisher or by financial constraints, you can feel free to make the best thing that you can.\"\n\n[h1]A Spoilerful Review by Someone Else[/h1]\n\nIf you've [i]already[/i] finished the game, or are for some silly reason resolved to never play it, then this is another review I'd recommend that discusses the nature of the game in a way that can't be done without spoilers:\n\n[spoiler]http://www.gamesradar.com/eureka-moment-what-witness-story-really-about/[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Sensory Info[/h1]\n\nThere are sections of the game where puzzles are sound and color based. If you have a sensory deficiency, you will not be able to finish those puzzles on your own. But, you could look up the solutions in a guide.\n\nSpecifically, the sound puzzles are: [spoiler]in the forest area where there are speakers attached to trees, etc, near the puzzles and for one puzzle in the shipwreck[/spoiler]\n\nThe color puzzles are [spoiler]in the greenhouse area on the sea facing side of the mountain and a few also in the village area[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1455404935, "timestamp_updated": 1456272228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823062360286712646", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22167740": {"recommendationid": "22167740", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964248641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3014, "last_played": 1514600584}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot begin to describe just how saddened I am by \"The Witness.\" I had been anticipating it for so long, but ultimately it's been an awful let-down.\n\n[h1]The short of it:[/h1]\n\nThe Witness delivered on its promise of beautiful visuals and challenging puzzles, but while it contains thoughtful (albeit \"borrowed\") philosophical content that's beautifully presented, ultimately the promise of a deep mystery to be uncovered was a bold-faced lie. The game had been hyped for years, and ended up so depressingly disappointing to me that In the end I could barely bring myself to finish it. It is a glut of repetitive, meaningless, storyless puzzle-solving in an otherwise visually compelling environment that would\u2019ve had the exact same impact on me had it been on the iPhone with pixellated 8-bit graphics. It wasn\u2019t a game; it was a task. And it wasn\u2019t one I felt any satisfaction from completing.\n\nThe description on the store states the following: \n\"You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.  You don't remember who you are, and you don't remember how you got here, but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home.\"\nEvery word of that is a lie, designed to draw you into an ultimately banal and repetitive walking simulator peppered with puzzles.\n\n[h1]The long of it:[/h1]\n\nI was anticipating playing The Witness literally for years, having followed the developer's blog from very early on. A rabid Myst series fan, I was chomping at the bit for another story-based puzzle game to sink my teeth into, especially when it was described as an island setting where you arrive without any understanding of why you're there. When it came out, I bought it instantly, literally purchasing a new gaming PC at the same time so I could experience it on modern hardware. (I was overdue for an upgrade anyway.)\n\nThe visuals are very pleasing to the eye in a bright and surrealistic way that walks a fine line between obviously unreal and bizarrely realistic. The lack of close-up shape and surface detail and overpowering color saturation mixed with believable reflections and lighting feel similar to the graphics of Team Fortress 2, oddly enough. Imagine if Aperture Science and a 5-star gardener with a degree in genetic engineering combined to create a manicured environment as an amusement park: Voila, you have the island from The Witness. It\u2019s a wonderful environment to behold, and was clearly an exhaustive effort to create. There\u2019s definitely a great deal of enjoyment to be had discovering the scope of the island and all its nooks and crannies.\n\nThe other area that the developers obviously spent a lot of time was the development of the puzzles themselves. Their logic is devious, challenging, and will require you to drag out a pencil and graph paper (or your chosen digital alternative.) There can be a high degree of enjoyment obtained from deciphering their cryptic composition, and the game does a very good job giving you just enough education on the rules to let you figure them out and reach that euphoric \"eureka\" moment. For a time it was wonderful, and at one point I even said to myself \u201cIf this could go on forever, that\u2019d be great.\u201d However, I was working off of the assumption that there would be a gradual revelation of the mystery of why I was there on this island, or at least some hints as to its purpose. As time went on, my heart sank deeper and deeper into despair as I realized that assumption was utterly and painfully wrong. It's clear they spent their efforts on the logic behind the puzzles and graphics engine, with no thought at all into building a reason for the player to actually _care_ about solving any of the hundreds of diabolical mazes strewn all around. I can\u2019t say that I hated playing this game, because I only hated it after I realized that everything I was doing was pointless. Up until that point, I was loving it.\n\nThe only content which can possibly pass off as having \u201cstory elements\" besides the unnerving statues strewn about the island are the live-action movies you can \u201cunlock\u201d by solving certain puzzles, all of which hail from a wide variety of sources and eras. Some are absolutely beautiful philosophical discussions on the nature of reality, human understanding, science, God, and cognition. Others are pure avant-garde art which can be thought-provoking, but ultimately only carry whatever meaning the viewer chooses to ascribe to them. Their most common feature, however, is that the game developers didn\u2019t make a single one of them. They\u2019re all from existing documentaries, interviews, and TED-like talks, and while I respect the developers\u2019 inclusion choices, they took absolutely no effort to incorporate into the game. There is one exception of original content, but it's so banal and drawn-out with no visual component that I nearly threw my controller in anger when I realized after sitting and listening to it drone on for almost a full hour that it's only message was: \"people like puzzles.\" The rest of the island is so devoid of meaningful story content that I found myself desperately trying to find and unlock all of the videos just to hear a human voice break the soul-crushing silence of the soundtrack-free environment. Indeed, the historical quotes and video excerpts are treats to someone who takes pleasure in philosophy and literature. However, if Jonathan Blow thought he could insert the words of great minds into his puzzle game to have them magically imbue it with deeper meaning, he's either deluded or just plain lazy.\n\nThis brings me to the thing which depresses me most: The Witness has no story, period. It's a beautiful venue with no party, no music and no people; a concept that actually has literal representation in the game at one point. After anticipating it for so long, the most powerful emotion I felt after completing The Witness was nothing short of betrayal. It felt like Jonathan Blow built it to lure in the kind of people who liked the games it was supposedly \"inspired by,\" only to troll them with a game that itself has no more mystery than a book of sudoku puzzles. I felt like I\u2019d been duped and lied to, and the \u201csecret\u201d ending doesn\u2019t help one bit in changing my mind, nor was it in any way original. In fact, it made me even more angry, because it is one of the single oldest (and worst) clich\u00e9 endings one can ever possibly use. You've probably guessed what it is just by me saying that...\n\nIn the end, The Witness has only one point: People like solving puzzles even when there\u2019s no purpose to doing so. It literally even *says this aloud* during the most disappointing piece of unlocked content. If you\u2019re the kind of person who just wants to use an expensive PC to do maze puzzles, The Witness is for you. Aside from that, it\u2019s nothing more than a walking simulator set on a beautiful island that would serve as a great demo for the Oculus Rift. The remaining \"meaningful\" content can be much more easily acquired from the original authors, or YouTube.\n\nI'm waiting for Obduction...", "timestamp_created": 1459459193, "timestamp_updated": 1529353449, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 806, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821345388889312744", "comment_count": 60, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30150353": {"recommendationid": "30150353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100933002", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1113, "last_played": 1487950904}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]I finished The Witness in that I got to the main ending. After experiencing the ending, I had to ask myself if I really enjoyed my time playing this game. In short, it's complicated.[/h1]\n\nI will say that I didn't know much about The Witness before playing, and I did this somewhat intentionally. It did something I have never seen done in a game in that it's almost anti-linear. I guess you could describe that as open-world, but even most of the open-world games I've played had a clear path you were supposed to take (especially those that don't give you access to the entire map from the beginning). The Witness silently encourages you to explore your surroundings. I would look around my immediate area and complete line puzzles until I would get to one I coldn't solve in a reasonable amount of time. Once here, I would walk away and find a new area to work on. The Witness is interesting in that you almost were required to do this, as some areas are unfinishable until you have learned certain puzzle mechanics from other areas. \n\nSince I didn't have any prior knowledge on The Witness, I was definitely disappointed to learn that this game is 95% solving line/grid puzzles. If that isn't what you are into then I do not recommend this game at all. As I progressed through the various types of line puzzles, I thought they were cleverly designed and made in a way so that each type felt new in a way. This kept me from getting too bored. What I did not appreciate was the difficulty. After finishing the 'tutorial' area for a new puzzle type, I would feel a sense of accomplishment that I figured out something new. Then I would face the inevitable \"oh wait, maybe my initial assumptions about these puzzles were wrong\" feeling, and I would go back and figure out my mistake. Once I got past that though, I was frequently met with the same frustration. I would have a line puzzle in front of me, I would know how to go about solving it, but I just couldn't find the right path to do so. It's similar to how I feel while playing a lot of point and click adventures. I have a platform thats too tall to climb up to, I have a rope, now how do I proceed?!\n\nThe Witness is absolutely beautiful, and it upsets me that there is no badge for this game. I would have loved to see the backgrounds that could have been made. Every different 'puzzle area' had it's own look and feel to it, and I loved the beginning of the game when I was simply exploring everything.\n\nThere is basically no story in this game at all, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. You can make up a story in your head, but what this game presents to you is too vague to give you anything concrete. This is my main problem with The Witness. Nothing about it felt fun. I would enjoy the lovely colors around me, but eventually I'd have to trudge around to find out where the puzzles were. After solving a puzzle, I'd feel satisfied but then the next one would be waiting for me and that satisfication quickly disappeared. I'd find audio recordings where the voices would just read a quote from a noteworthy person from history and some artwork drawn by who knows. \n\nI marched on despite all this. I did the majority of the puzzles without much help, and I got to the mountain. Once I got there though, all shame went out the window. I just wanted to get to the end of the game, and once again the game throws me more line puzzles. And for what? Is this some kind of challenge to see if I was paying attention to the hundreds of other puzzles I solved before? Am I supposed to struggle through them and eventually feel smart and good about myself that I did it? I don't find that rewarding. I will say that I'm glad I didn't waste the time going through the mountain puzzles given what the ending was like. \n\n[b]The Witness is engaging, and that's why I played for as long as I did. However, it's not entertaining or fun. I won't think back and say to myself, \"playing through that was so great\" or \"I can't wait to play that again in 2 years\". That is my opinion. I can't give this game a thumbs down though. I want people to play this game because I think it's the kind you'll either love or hate, which means discussions about it will be interesting.[/b]\n\nThere are no jump scares, although the whole time playing I felt like something was watching me.

The basic goal of the game is simple: solve line- and symbol- based logic puzzles.  That's it.  Their rules are taught only by doing them in ever increasing complexity.  Once you finish a section of the island, typically with a themed rule set or aesthetic, several more distinct regions await with yet more puzzles to solve, until one by one they're completed.  Of course, the end is not the end.  There are myriad hidden secrets, environmental puzzles, illusions, and unrelated sights to be discovered beyond just line puzzles.

I found the color palette, in particular, distracting and annoying, rather than soothing. And there is a sterility and artificiality to the whole environment that made me weary.\n\nThe second problem is, thankfully, an optional experience. And I am grateful to the developers that they made it optional.  There are interactive memory cards scattered around the environment. When you click on one, a famous quotation is read/recited. I recognized many of the quotes from my university days and my own personal reading over the last 60ish years. The quotations are not unconnected to their surroundings. But I find them tedious and pretentious. After the first few, I stopped clicking on them all together.\n\nThe other problem I have with the quotations is that they are all taken out of context. Context is extremely important in all areas of communication., but especially written communication. Taken out of context, quotations become sound bites that are carefully chosen to support the chooser's ideas and beliefs.

Obviously, there are exceptions to these sad trends, but you'd  be hard-pressed to find a reasonably complex game where nothing is arbitrary.\n\n[i]The Witness[/i] is such a game. More than that: it actually goes beyond simply being deliberate. Every element in the game, be it art, sound, animation, etc, doesn't only serve a purpose\u2014it usually has [i]several[/i] functions. As the game's designer Jonathan Blow so astutely (if unkindly) put it,\n\n[i]\"In fiction writing, there is this concept that you want every sentence to do more than one thing: you want to describe the setting and set the mood and introduce the character. You want to say what happened and show how a character feels about it and foreshadow a later consequence.\n\nFor some reason game designers never got this memo.\"[/i]\n\nAnd he doesn't only criticize. He delivers too.\n\n[h1]HOLY SMOKES IT'S GOOD[/h1]\n[i]The Witness[/i] is a puzzle game that has you walk a visually stunning island with several separate areas, each having a bunch of puzzles, secrets, and thought-provoking vistas. What they don't have is any verbal tutorials. Everything you need to learn, including the most obscure puzzle rules, is learned through actually doing it.\n\nSounds simple enough, but the result is mind-blowing. Figuring out each rule feels like an achievement. The game knows it full well: your reward for being smart is often more puzzles (because no superficial reward can compare to the chance to figure out more stuff). The puzzles are very different too, requiring unexpected approaches and thinking outside the box. Going into further detail would be spoiling the game; let's just say it's very consistent in its theme, so everything you see is there for a reason. \n\n[i]Everything.[/i]\n\n(When grasping at straws and trying to find a flaw in [i]The Witness's[/i] design, I half-jokingly thought that the only thing that seemed random was that we could see the protagonist's shadow for no apparent reason\u2014having no plot, the game doesn't have to show us that the main character is human at all, so why add the shadow? Well, sure enough\u2014as soon as I thought this, the shadow was used in a puzzle.)\n\n[h1]IT'S INCREDIBLE YOU SHOULD BUY IT[/h1]\nThis is a rare and precious thing to say, but I honestly feel that [i]The Witness[/i] enriched me. It made me smarter. It tested and massaged my cognitive abilities in all the right ways; even the audio logs scattered across the island (one of the more \"flavourful\" and less fuctional elements of the game) were genuinely interesting, with smart people talking of smart things in compelling ways.\n\nSo if you're a puzzle lover, play this game. If you're in doubt, play this game. If you're a teacher or designer, play this game. Actually, if you're none of those things, I honestly feel like it would do you good to play [i]The Witness[/i] anyway\u2014for educational purposes, if nothing else; it's an incredible study of non-verbal learning, learning in general, and the role of patterns in human cognition.

Ultimately, I couldn\u2019t help but feel \u2018scammed\u2019 by the narration, which kept increasing my frustration towards the game.\nAnd while figuring out the puzzles was rewarding, finishing the game\u2026 wasn\u2019t.

And this is where it surprised the living bees out of me, because in spite of all that's written above this game turned out to be very fun and addictive.\n\nThe secret is, obviously, in the puzzles. They're quirky. They're inobvious. They're varied. They require you to pay attention to your surroundings and sometimes to think creatively. They're not too hard, at least those that you need to solve to get the base ending, but they make you feel smart, and make you feel like you've achieved something by solving them. But yes, there're much harder ones in the game too, they're just optional.\n\nRemember the first Portal? Remember those puzzles that seem unsolvable, but then you think about them for a couple of minutes and arrive at a solution? Well, the Witness basically embodies it. \n\nThis is pretty much controlled creativity, and that is what makes this game so addictive. A typical puzzle in the Witness is like this: you see a panel with the puzzle, you think, holy shit, this is so hard and/or impossible to solve, I'm gonna quit the game now. After five minutes you go back and attempt to solve it. You realize that it wouldn't actually be all that hard, there's a pretty straightforward way to solve it, but, oh no! O cruel heavens! It's blocked. It forces you to think of the alternatives. You try something that is bound to fail once, twice, and then you get an idea. You try to realize it, and on the first or the second try you most likely solve the puzzle. Hooray, you clever you. Now go and repeat it with the next one - and this is important! - not really a harder one. \n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles is pretty much universal. There're really simple puzzles, sure, but they're there to teach you the rules. Nobody explains you the rules in a human language. You figure them out yourself, by solving puzzles. This is nonverbal communication Jonathan Blow is so fond of. and this makes the game very accessible and very interesting. Whatever language you speak, it's mostly irrelevant, you'll still be able to finish the game. You'll miss on some philosophical quotes, but for me they didn't add all that much to the experience. And you'll learn a new language, a language of a line going through mazes.\n\nThe puzzles are divided into logical and enviromental, and you'll have to figure out yourself which are which. There're several zones with different kinds of puzzles, and within those zones the puzzles usually go from easy to slightly not easy, in fact not easy at all, in fact, they are hard as ah nevermind, solved it. Also, the puzzles are very local: if you know the rules behind each symbol, you'll be able to just go ahead and solve everything the location has to offer on the spot. But knowledge is often not the case, so you have to go somewhere else and find some puzzles you can actually solve - most often the tutorials for the symbols - and then return and say, yah! It's still not easy at all, but at least I know how to approach it now. Unless those were the enviromental puzzles, and you had to find something relevant in your surroundings. In which case the puzzles are still as mysterious as an emerald doughnut.\n\nSo this is the Witness, a game where you're rewarded for solving puzzles with feeling clever, and this is somehow enough. If you're able to enjoy originality and quirkiness, and are not too demanding about the presence of the plot, please, do play this game. It's basically like believing in six impossible things before breakfast. Except all six start at the big circle and go through a maze the right way while not crossing themselves.\n\nP.S.

Like, \"10 minutes of poking at it, take a break and sleep on it, graph it, run around the map staring at it from different angles for 5 minutes, go do some other puzzles, come back, AH HA, poke at it for 10 minutes, solved!\" hard.\n\n4) There are puzzles absolutely everywhere that you can't see until you know what you're looking for. And then you get paranoid seeing bits and pieces of them, trying to make your hallucinations connect together into a complete puzzle.\n\nThrough all this the game becomes pretty excellent and is constantly surprising when you least expect it. The major puzzle areas are pretty open to tackle in any order. The island itself looks great and there's some amazing visual surprises that are fun to discover. Everywhere you look you have to wonder if you're seeing all the hidden layers.\n\nThere's hidden recordings and videos of real deep quotes/essays. Some are interesting and some are sort of philosophically embarrassing. This is the weakest part of the game for me, but they can be ignored entirely.

Fans of the genre must play this. So much has been written about this game, but I'll still add my own words and attempt to present it to you with no spoilers.\n\nImagine a grid-based puzzle game in which certain kinds of squares have certain kinds of rules and the rules can interact with each other in complex ways requiring you to find a clever solution that would satisfy them all. This is already something a lot of us would enjoy.\n\nNow imagine that you're not actually told these rules, but rather have to infer them yourself via a few easier puzzles. Some of the rules are complex enough that you might think you understand them, and indeed you've managed to solve a lot of puzzles, but you find out later that your understanding was incomplete. This learning process adds an additional layer of reasoning, requiring both deduction and induction. The result is a primal satisfaction in the realization that you've learned something new and useful.\n\nNow imagine that all of this is set in a breathtakingly gorgeous, superbly landscaped and architected 3D world in which the environment can invade the puzzle and become part of it, or indeed [I]is[/I] the puzzle. You need to explore and look and even listen very, very, [I]very[/I] carefully. You often need to literally think outside the box.\n\nAnd now put lots and lots of this content, and even more optional content (with a twist) for fanatical completionists, and finally wrap it in fragments of narrative that contemplatively contextualize the entirety of the game. You have [I]The Witness[/I].\n\nI do have some criticism. There are some aspects that conflict with the core principles of the game, as it presents itself to you, and are otherwise simply not fun.\n\nFirstly, the environment is an open world, but to succeed you need to go through it in a fairly specific order. You can learn through trial and error what works and what doesn't, but it could easily require a [I]whole lot[/I] of trial and error. This, to me, disrespects a certain but common kind of player, who when faced with a challenge tries to work it out before moving on. If that's you, then you're going to have a bad time, at least until you learn (the hard way) to go somewhere else and come back later. But even after you learn this lesson, it's applied and communicated inconsistently. Sometimes you may think you [I]should[/I] be ready for a puzzle, but in fact you're missing a crucial lesson. So you'll be moving back and forth and back and forth a great deal and questioning your intelligence. To me, this meta mechanic stands in the way of enjoying the core mechanic instead of enhancing it.\n\nSecondly, though a lot of effort has gone into making the puzzles [I]fair[/I], in that players could figure out solutions without resorting to trickery or brute force, it does not follow that solutions are not tedious. Jonathan Blow stated that he strongly disliked the \"pixel hunting\" that many such games require, and [I]The Witness[/I] is great at making use of the core mechanic of drawing big, thick lines from a clear starting point to a clear end point. Unfortunately, I think [I]The Witness[/I] sometimes fails to avoid that kind of tedium. Quite a few puzzles require you to use [I]very[/I] specific positions, angles, and timings with no indication of failure. And, ironically, some of the most difficult optional puzzles are [I]exactly[/I] about pixel hunting. So much for pretense. Are these puzzles fair? Strictly speaking, pixel hunting is fair: you can patiently hunt for and find the pixels without resorting to tricks. But is it fun? If spending a whole weekend moving back and forth across the landscape looking for a bunch of pixels sounds fun to you, then yes. I, on the other hand, preferred to use a walkthrough for those. And even then, it was often unnecessarily difficult (=frustrating) to achieve the necessary precision.\n\nStill, to his credit, the most frustrating pixel-hunting puzzles are optional. You can (and probably will, at least at first) complete the game without having to tackle them or even being aware of them.\n\nMy final criticism is that the tone of the game can be oppressive. It's beautiful while being devoid of a sense of joy, as if there's absolutely no humor allowed. The few bits of spoken narrative speak to a concept that takes itself very, very seriously, and seemingly [I]intends[/I] to be overbearing. There are some important Easter-egg-like exceptions to this, and perhaps it's intended that you roll your eyes a bit, too. I get it, but I still think this monument to austerity would have been enhanced with, rather than hurt by, more obviously lighthearted interventions.\n\nDespite my specific frustrations, I count [I]The Witness[/I] as a classic of the puzzle genre, of video games, and even of games in general. Blow believes that video games can deliver unto us epiphanies, and here he shows us how it can be done. [I]The Witness[/I] doesn't create a new genre, although I'm sure there will be many clones and homages. Instead, the game's innovation is in its total dedication to its principles, which even meant creating an original 3D engine for it. Even if it doesn't always succeed in comprehensive consistency, [I]The Witness[/I] is an example of where games could take us.\n\nFinal recommendation: Blow has talked extensively about [I]The Witness[/I], but I think the best discussion is in his long interview with Adam Conover, which you can find on YouTube.", "timestamp_created": 1547527044, "timestamp_updated": 1583915311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7762489914894104", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50306699": {"recommendationid": "50306699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023408709", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 705, "last_played": 1556138448}, "language": "english", "review": "Game description claims \"captions\" but many of the puzzles require audio clues to solve.

That was love.\n\nAfter a while, I realized that the promised narrative (and I say promised because the Steam's misleading description clearly promises it, by stating \"You don't remember who you are, [..] but there's one thing you can do: explore the island in hope of discovering clues, regaining your memory, and somehow finding your way home\") is a failed promise. There is no narrative here, other than what you might imagine by yourself, as if looking at a stone cold sculpture. Solving puzzles has almost no consequence. Many little things I didn't care about before (like some puzzles requiring millimetrical positioning in the world, but the engine not supporting analog joystick movement) began to annoy me. That was hate.\n\nI moved on. I decided to ignore the missing narrative, to try and just enjoy the puzzles, and the dedication with which the island was crafted. It worked. There is so much richness in The Witness' island, and so many relations between elements. Like that one statue which, if looked from the right perspective, wants to hold hands with a farther one. It's like a beautiful alien mechanism that pushes you to find its deeper connections (only later I realized those connections weren't really meaningful and mostly random, which can still be a beautiful thing but, you know, it depends). That was love again.\n\nFinally, I reached the last part of the game. And the puzzles (and the misleading narrative) decided to troll me more evidently. Instead of implementing new ideas, they used dirty tricks like flashing lights and colors and glitchy monitors. They were trying to hurt me, physically. To solve one batch I ended up nauseous. To solve another my vision became blurry for a while. And mind you, these puzzles are not skippable: you HAVE to hurt yourself to go on. Every game developer knows you don't do flashing lights and colors, because on a wide range of people they can have really bad effects, and the eyes are a delicate thing. That was hate, again.\n\nThen there was the ending(s). I won't say anything about it to avoid spoilers, but let's just say that, when I connected the dots, I realized that The Witness is just a big FU to players, possibly to humanity. Its anti-philosophical philosophy sways from intellectual frigidity to adolescent depth, from incoherent nihilism to detached positivism, and is overall like a M\u00f6bius strip, rolling over itself without anywhere else to go. The Witness didn't have anything to say, other than that it hated me.\n\nI never wrote a negative Steam review (other than for the horrible Godus), and I thought I'd write this while still recommending the game. Because, as I mentioned, the island is beautiful, and most puzzles really cool. But then I thought about it more. Yes, I did love part of this, but at this price (please note, I was initially a big supporter of its high price), I can't recommend a game that hates you, and cheats you into believing there's a narrative which is not there. So. My two cents.\n\n[h1]EDIT[/h1]\nIt's been a few days now, and I decided to change my review to positive (while leaving my previous words untouched). When I initially finished The Witness, I was angry and very annoyed. In hindsight though, the game's merits feel bigger than its demerits. Sure, I still believe it's a carefully and beautifully crafted empty shell (I'm not really sure if it wanted to be more but couldn't, or if it decided to embrace/show its own limits with frustrated anger) with an overall FU message, but it has a lot of potential, and I hope it will pave the way for better games, both as a culture and as a media. Also, as I mentioned in the review, most puzzles, even if inconsequential, are really good. They have a great learning curve, are well connected to each other, and never feel frustrating (except the \"I want to physically hurt you\" ones towards the end).\n\nSo. The Witness is, in my humble opinion, a glorious puzzle game on possibly the most beautiful virtual island I ever saw. Other than that, even if it fails at being more, it still shows such potential that it's a game you should play, to see it for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1455026443, "timestamp_updated": 1455371246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.77566903829574585", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117612161": {"recommendationid": "117612161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266957582", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1635638844}, "language": "english", "review": "worse than the looker", "timestamp_created": 1656196194, "timestamp_updated": 1656196194, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 469, "votes_funny": 304, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774534881114959717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72204668": {"recommendationid": "72204668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025347765", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2097, "last_played": 1573782544}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't like the first hour of gameplay there's nothing else worth sticking around for, it doesn't get better.

Here is the reason: [spoiler]There are hidden enviromental puzzles in the game. Some are broken appart and can only be connected by riding a vehicle and getting the right perspective. So that is why some of the things move delibertly slow, so you can solve the puzzles. It's not \"bad on purpose\" just for the sake of it, like Joseph proposed while being extra salty.[/spoiler]\n\nJonathan Blow also really likes zen. This is why the witness doesn't have any high octane action but is deliberatly calming. \n\nThe puzzle variety is often brought up but I can't really see that as an issue. Yes all the 500 puzzles are line drawing and generally 10+ puzzles per mechanic are just tutorial. But all the others all have unique solutions and as long as every one is challenging one can't really call it repetitive. \n\nThe only issues that actually are valid would be the accessability problems.

There are things I love but also many things which are just plain wrong. Let me recap:\n\nGood:\n\n- The puzzles themselves are pretty good. It's fun to discover and learn each new mechanic and they all work nice together. It really is a brilliant and tight design at its best.\n- The environmental puzzles are the best - the play with perspective never gets old.\n- The graphics are pretty nice, with their own unique art style.\n\nBad:\n\n- No narrative whatsover. This is the game's biggest flaw, but a major one. You get the [spoiler]smart quotes from audio logs[/spoiler] and [spoiler]boring as hell movie segments[/spoiler], but those have no connection to the game, other than celebrating the greatness of human intelect. With no story to tell, the whole experience feels very shallow in the end. Even a crappy story would have been better than this. If you compare it to Talos Principle, it's obvious how completely missed opportunity it is right there.\n- The Island opens up pretty quickly and you initially spend lot of time travelling around without actually achievening anything, as you have no idea how to solve most of the mechanics. In comparison, navigating the corridors of Antichamber provided much better scope for learning each mechanic. Fortunately, once you find [spoiler]the boat with the map[/spoiler] it's smooth sailing.\n- The normal puzzles themselves become tedious pretty quickly. Once you learn the mechanics, solving the more difficult puzzles just takes more time but gives little joy in return. There is an occasional new twist thrown in from time to time, but eventually you start to wonder \"why exactly am I spending my time with this?\".\n- The most anticlimactic ending I have experienced in a long time. Like for real? In Talos Principle, even the \"bad\" ending had a strong meaning as it was part of the story arc, but in this case, it just emphasized how meaningless it all was. After watching it in disbelief for couple minutes all I felt was the strongest sense of complete waste of time. Even though I did all the lasers already, I couldn't be bothered to hunt the remaining puzzles anymore and will just uninstall the game with bitter aftertaste.\n\nSo, is it worth the purchase? If you have enough time and enjoy puzzles, I guess it is (on sale), but if you are looking for a Myst-like or Talos-like experience, you won't find it here.

Had this been sold for half the price on the basis of \"I've thought up some interesting mechanics to stick into a maze/grid puzzle, here's 500 or so of them\" I'd have probably quite enjoyed solving a few dozen of them. The problem is that The Witness promises intrigue and a story which it nevers delivers on.\n\nThe puzzles are okay but being limited to just pathing a line through a grid means that solutions at times are pushed past what is reasonable and mechanics are introduced which are just plain bad. There are parts to game where you need to use sound to solve puzzles but this isn't always made obvious and later in the game some puzzles have their difficulty increased by using flashing colours and disorienting, moving grids. A bit cheap for a thinking-mans puzzle game.\n\nThe game does have some nice sections and some of the more enviromentally based puzzles are satisfying but they can't make up for the lack of depth or the missing narrative which gradually saps your enthusiasm. The environment is pretty, and the world design is interesting to discover but I can't help wishing they'd given us some way to interact with all that beauty.\n\nI think most players will walk away from The Witness thinking what a great experience it [i]could have been[/i] but feeling short changed by the promise of solving the larger mystery of the world and not entirely impressed by some of the games tricks for artificially stretching the difficulty of the puzzles.\n\n\nAdditionally, I found it very interesting to look through the other negative reviews of this game and notice how many others that don't usually review games have made the effort to express their disappointment of The Witness.

I don't think this game is for everybody. Players that expect some revelatory story moment or huge twist upon solving a puzzle will be disappointed. Instead, you gradually discover how the world of the Witness works in a series of subtle moments. I feel like the Witness is for people who are intrinsically curious, and want to understand the world around them for the sake of understanding the world around them.\n\nTo me, the world of the Witness feels like an much smaller version of our world and, by extension, the player's time with the game feels like a miniature liftetime. When you first start the game with (hopefully) no prior knowledge of the world, you are basically a newborn. You play with the immediate environment around you, poke stuff, click stuff, and try to make sense of the basics of the way the world works. After a few hours under your belt, you'll have an understanding of the world at face value, and may even get a little cocky, thinking you've got the game down. However, after spending 60+ hours with the game, I can look back at my 10 hour self and laugh at how little I actually understood about the world of the Witness, how naive I was, and how much more I had to discover.\n\nThen you'll reach \"adulthood\", where you don't know everything about the world but you've begun to see the deeper secrets of it, and you have enough experience to start to wrap your head around the scope of the actual game. You'll reach a point where you realize how much more there is to this place, and for me that was one of my best memories in gaming. \n\nIf you stick with it for hours after that, you'll eventually get the \"reward\". That reward was when I felt confident enough to say I had a good understanding of the Witness. Puzzles that used to take 30 minutes now took 30 seconds. The island that felt so huge and overwhelming at first I now knew like the back of my hand. I looked at things in a completely different perspective than I did at the start. The game makes you feel like a genius. Maybe not a genius in real life, but a genius in your Witness life. \n\nI still have a lot to go before I solve everything the Witness has to offer, and to be honest I probably never will, but I've never had a game that respected it's players ability to discover and learn as much as this game.

It was repetitive to the point of being monotonous and frustrating.  There was never any \"ah-ha\" feeling of genius, just solving the same puzzle over and over (with some slightly changing rules).\n\nSo far, I've \"only\" played 11 hours and activated 2 lasers (~100 puzzles), but I have to say I'm done.

It's just not for everyone.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add clarification for what I've done in the game.  \n\nI'm more of an explorer type so I wandered around and saw every major area in the game.  I also built-up an understanding for most (if not all) of the rules in the game.\n\nI understand the rules for hexagons, squares, \"tetris\" blocks, \"stars\", etc.\n\nI did symmetry maze puzzles, tree branching maze puzzles (two major types), sound maze puzzles (which were TERRIBLE), hedge maze puzzles (probably the best ones in the game), color tinted maze puzzles, object tracing maze puzzles, etc.  (Basically 11 hours of nothing but maze puzzles.)\n\nI went completely through the \"treehouse\". I climbed to the top of the mountain.  I unlocked pretentious videos.  I unlocked pretentious audio recordings (one of which was 8 minutes long!).  I took boat rides around the island.  I feel that I have a pretty good idea of what this game offers and it's simply not for me.", "timestamp_created": 1454199464, "timestamp_updated": 1454354739, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 630, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754885733127593994", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20772022": {"recommendationid": "20772022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046663378", "num_games_owned": 1708, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 2021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1012, "last_played": 1581142485}, "language": "english", "review": "Sometimes you just might be in the mood for a game that will make you feel stupid.

There's no point in trying to brute force it, because there will just be more difficult versions of it beyond the door it unlocks. You will eventually learn how to complete it, at which point you can return and complete it with .\n\nAlso, if you reach a platform that moves you to a place it seems you can never leave, try to solve the puzzle on the platform in a different matter.\n\n[h1][b][u]Initial Reaction[/u][/b][/h1]\nReally though, the bottom line here is that this is a massive puzzle-filled game which competes with the likes of the Portal franchise and The Talos Principle. If you're going to go ahead and sum up this game with, \"so it's just mazes\", then I'm going to go ahead and sum up Portal with, \"so it's just portals\". This is an atmospheric puzzle game through-and-through. The visuals are stunning, despite the complete lack of options related to them, which probably came about as a problem resulting from an indie developer trying their hand at creating a game engine from the ground up rather than using something already established like Unity, Unreal, Crytek, etc... If this game is \"just mazes\", I dare you to try and beat it without the assistance of somebody else. This game is hard. And while mazes are the core mechanic, just like portals are in the Portal games, there are plenty of twists on the mechanic that help change things up just enough, just like in every single other game with a core mechanic that is branched off of.\n\nAnd after looking over a whole bunch of the other reviews, I'm really confused because this isn't a situation like Amazon's reviews where people can just willy nilly review products they didn't purchase. These are all people who legitimately purchased The Witness who are giving it negative reviews. Are these based off of reactions from watching trailers? Did people want another Braid? Where's the audience that gave The Talos Principle a 96% on Steam? This is The Talos Principle on steroids. This is The Talos Principle if the entirety of the game's content was open from the beginning, and you accidentally stumbled onto the last few puzzles of the game.\n\nDon't chalk up the game's length to whatever amount of time it takes you to beat the game after having solved the first 5 puzzles on your own, and eventually breaking down and resorting to the use of a guide. These is Dark Souls-levels of difficulty and eventual satisfaction after having accomplished something you never thought you would. This is easily one of the biggest and most difficult puzzle games available on Steam at the moment, and don't let anybody convince you that it's nothing short of great.\n\nThis game is currently sitting at an 89% on Metacritic, and a 76% here on Steam, with various well-known critics like IGN, Destructoid, Telegraph, and Guardian giving the game perfect 10s. This game is a big deal, and hopefully the Steam userbase, being mostly populated by gamers playing a crate-opening simulator, recognizes that this is far more than just a bunch of mazes.\n\n[h1][b][u]After 10+ Hours[/u][/b][/h1]\nOnce you've hit a certain point in the game, everything just starts to click. You begin to realize how crucial it really is to just straight up abandon a difficult puzzle and come back to it, especially if you feel like you're just brute forcing the thing at that point. This game turns into a unique kind of Metroidvania game right off the bat, in which every path is available for the player to explore, but the player soon finds out that some paths are more difficult or even impossible when compared to others. The game doesn't provide you with a unique ability that allows you to double jump up walls, or turn into a ball and roll through tight spaces. Instead, the game offers you the knowledge to go back to these difficult areas and know what you're doing through the use of little mini-tutorials that don't feel like they're holding your hand at all. They feel like they take the same approach that the start of the game does. They feel natural, which is once again why I must stress the importance of abandoning unfamiliar puzzles until you learn how to complete them later on.\n\nThis is as much a maze game as Dark Souls is a combat game. Sure, it's a pivotal gameplay mechanic, but it produces a much wider range of puzzles than I've ever seen before in a puzzle game, and you can't just take the word of someone who's put 1 hour into the game and called it quits.\n\n[h1][b][u]Summary[/u][/b][/h1]\nPros and cons of the game's release-day content.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]600+ puzzles, with a very steep learning curve.\n    [*]No handholding or boring filler content.

After replaying it I love it even more. Pretty sure I'd put this in my all-time top 5 now, it's a masterclass in game design. The game uses the unique language of the medium to teach you the rules to every puzzle. These are still the smartest 'tutorials' I've encountered and it's a disservice to label them as such. I love the variety in the riddles too, since every section on the Island you explore has its own theme and taps into a different skillset. \nThe tool you use to solve the puzzles is the same all the way through (drawing lines), but the mechanics and skillsets required to get there change all the time. Every area has twists and curveballs to their unique concept as well, there's no area that gets predictable.  The puzzles are so good that I never wanted to resort to using a guide, it's the one way you can ruin this game.

The sense of discovery, the satisfaction you get after finally solving a devious puzzle... I still haven't experienced that in another game since.\n\nAs a bonus this game is also a confidence booster, because one of the essential messages of the game is that you already have every skill required to beat the puzzles, everything is already inside of you.

First playthrough was easily over 100 hours.\n\nI think this is probably the best video game that's ever been made.  It's certainly my favorite, but beyond personal preference, what it accomplishes is mind blowing.  I've never had any piece of art make me feel as much a part of the human race as this does.  There's a million things about this I could talk about, but two things I'll mention here are:\n\n1. The realization that, whether cultural or biological, our brains are very predictable.  When there's three different ways to solve a puzzle, the game seems to have already known which one you'd pick first, second, and third.  [spoiler]This becomes more apparent after the endgame when you get a chance to redo some puzzles to solve other puzzles.[/spoiler]\n\n2. At first the game seems like it's about solving puzzles, but as it goes on, you realize that the game is actually about getting stumped, stepping back, and after some amount of observation of the world around you, having that immediate realization of the solution.  It teaches you how to learn, and in a way that's applicable outside of the game too.\n\nThe game is also constructed like a classical symphony, with motifs used to build themes, and themes in various structures, but even though they start as abstract imagery/concepts, as the themes build, the abstractions fade and you are given some suggestions as to what these things all mean, much like in a film.  There's other, even more meaningful things I experienced with the game, but they're too abstract to talk about in a review.  And I could talk about this for hours.\n\nIf you're looking to burn through a puzzle game, there's amazing puzzles in this, but like I said, it's not set up as a pile of puzzles to solve one after another.  If you're looking for a game with an explicit story that bangs you over the head like almost every other video game I've played, you'll be furious after playing this.

And i think one of the most experimental puzzle games of its decade. \n\nThe Witness draws comments such as \"there is no explanation\" or \"there is no direction\" or even \"it is too hard\". \nIt is none of these things and it is all of these things all at once. And for all one basic reason, which has already been given to the player. You are The Witness.\n\nIt is your job to look, and to see and to take in. At the mercy of your own attentive discipline, ability to extrapolate logic, and above all else, to see the unseen path. That last part becomes particularly mind blowing when you discover witness's true hidden nature. And if you fail in any of these, you have essentially failed yourself in a way. Harsh i know.\n\nAt its core it is a game about witnessing... everything. And sure yes, there is an overarching philosophical puzzle much like The Talos Principle, but that's not the main point of The Witness.\n\nThe main point of the witness is to watch, to extrapolate, to learn and to internalise. The logic of all puzzles is taught to you completely diegetically if you are willing to pay attention, to explore, and to see all paths around you. At some point you reach a level of implicit understanding that brings everything all together, almost akin to a zen state, which the environment can often bring about with its serene stillness and solitude. A stillness and solitude which help you to sit with your own thoughts, your own discovery.\n\nOver the course of the game, through your self realisation and understanding you have internalised, plus what is presented to you externally, you begin to connect it all into one glorious tapestry.  And you will need to have internalised all of that knowledge before the end. Because what awaits you will push you to your limits of what you thought you knew about yourself. Which in my opinion, is the true point of The Witness, to allow self betterment. \n\nAt which point i can see why many don't like this game, self betterment isn't for everyone, and not everyone is capable either. And even if you succeed, its still just a game, or is it? I took a bit of The Witness away with me when i finished it, and likewise i think i left something behind as well. \n\nJust a few thoughts on what i consider a truly great game in all regards.

It's hard to believe because one of the most used complaints are that it's only one puzzle, but it's actually one mechanic that is always the same. The puzzles itself vary a lot in terms of complexity, difficulty and creativity. Especially when they're combined.\n\nThe downside of the game is that you can't really tell anyone what is so fantastic about it without going deep into the spoiler territory. The trailer just shows various puzzles and the mechanic of the game and nothing about the actual feeling of playing the game. Even Johnathan Blow said that in the /noclip documentary about The Witness. And even that wouldn't do the game justice if you ask me. I won't go into any spoilers why this game is truly a masterpiece. But let me tell you that it's an experience you won't forget on the same level as Journey. You can't really tell what was so great about Journey. It doesn't really have a story, it didn't had superb graphics or sound nor the gameplay was fully fleshed out and challenging. But the experience of playing the game was what made the game so fantastic.\n\nGive The Witness a chance and you won't regret it, I promise. I wish I could forget the experience of playing this game so I can play it anew. But waiting a couple of years until I forgot about everything should also work I hope.\n\nThere are no real rewards in this game, no fireworks, no \"CONGLATURATION!\", but there is satisfaction. Pure satisfaction. A whole lot of it. And once you feel it, you understand why most games feel shallow and lackluster at the end. Because there was no real challenge. It didn't give you something back in return that you can use in your life. \n\nBut I'll give you one single tip: You can do it! Don't turn around and wave a puzzle off because you think you need to unlock an item first or something. If you understood the concept of the puzzle, then you can do it! You just need to be patient. \n\nBut I also wouldn't say that this game is for everyone. And I know this sounds way more self entitled than I actually mean it.

[b]But it is really impressive.[/b] First and foremost, the island is just overflowing with gorgeous views and attention to detail. In every nook-and-cranny you will find such tender loving care. I can't stress this part enough. I was always running around just overwhelmed by things to check out and figuring out all the oh-so clever little details. Secondly, while the puzzles have a few minor design issues - they are mostly brilliant. And there are a metric ton of them. \n\n[b]One thing [i]The Witness[/i] pulls off remarkably well is puzzle difficulty balance.[/b] Yes, some puzzles frustrated me, but if you sit and stare at it long enough - you will wrap your head around the solution. And due to the sandbox nature of this game, you can always move on to another puzzle. You do learn and certainly get better at solving them. Once you learn a particular style of puzzle, it feels very satisfying to just crunch a series of puzzles.\n\n[b]The low points of this title are the story, a few design decisions with some puzzle types, and a handful of other quirky things I'll explain.[/b] The story was truly potential squandered. I'm not giving details, but all I can say is that this aint no [i]Talos Principle[/i]. If you are interested in this for the story - run away. It was truly a wasted opportunity to tell an epic tale. Now for some of the puzzle design decisions. Firstly if you are colorblind (like me) and/or tone deaf (me again!) you are going to simply need a walkthrough for a small handful of puzzles. Not many, but it doesn't feel great. I have a few other nitpicks with some of the puzzle design, but I'm not going to go into detail here. [b]Again, a majority of the time the puzzles are an absolute delight.[/b] The largest technical issue is that there is no autorun. I held the shift+w key down for 34 hours. This is pure insanity. Some defend this as [i]'just take it slow and let the experience wash over you'[/i] kind of deal. There is so much backtracking across a fairly small island. Anyone who walked the whole time is insane, I'm sorry. We could of used a few other QoL options such as analog stick sensitivity and fast travel.

I completed the game only out of pride and curiosity to see if there was any kind of big reveal at the end. I was disappointed.\n\nUltimately, whether or not you will like this game depends on your philosophy about what a video game should be. If you haven't watched the Youtube video titled Jonathan Blow: How Mainstream Devs Are Getting It Wrong, I suggest you watch it before dropping $40 on this game. Blow is the lead developer for The Witness and Braid, and his philosophy about games is that they shouldn't be designed to be fun. Rather they should be designed to instill a particular emotion in the player. He also detests hand-holding by the developers, opting for an approach where the game lets players discover everything on their own. These principles are on full display in The Witness. Much of the game is not fun. It is often brainwracking and frustrating. The emotion he wants you to experience through this process is that \"eureka!\" moment from discovering everything all on your own. For some, that experience might justify the price.\n\nHowever, I disagree with Blow. I understand his desire to use video games as an artistic form of expression, but ultimately when I play a game that has over 600 puzzles and easily over 20 hours of gameplay, I want it to be a fun experience. I contrast his philosophy on game design with Sid Meier's. Meier would take an interesting concept and attempt to develop it into a workable game. He would have testers play the game over and over, making changes each time, based on player feedback, until it was fun. If he could not make it fun for the majority of people, he would scrap the game. Jonathan Blow doesn't do this. Fun wasn't a design consideration in the Witness. Therefore, he decided not to incorporate anything into the game that might distract from his themes of exploration and discovery, despite the possibility of making the game more enjoyable for the majority of people. So what we have in the end is Blow's vision of what he wants the game to be, as uncontaminated by player opinions as possible.\n\nIt's too bad because if these well conceived puzzles and pretty open world were incorporated into a suspenseful plot where details were revealed after solving each area, I would have really liked this game. Sadly, there is no plot here, and for the majority of people the puzzles alone probably aren't rewarding enough to motivate you to slog through it without resorting to guides on the internet. Thus, I only recommend The Witness for those who just really enjoy puzzles or who are willing to play a game despite it not being an enjoyable experience much of the time. \n\nIf you do decide to get this game, take my advice: savor it slowly. The puzzles are much more enjoyable if you do them a few at a time, rather than binge-puzzling through entire areas. If you get stuck on a puzzle, minimize frustration by taking a break from the game or exploring somewhere else for a while. And the puzzles in the ending area are the worst in the game. They are all either extremely difficult puzzles, or they are easy but unoriginal, tedious, and annoying.\n\nPros: Experience of discovery and exploration, beautiful scenery, clever puzzle design.\nCons: Hours of frustration, no plot to discover, ending puzzles are terrible, and the ending itself isn't great either.\n\nEDIT 3/10/2016: Many people didn't think I clearly stated my personal opinion, so \"(myself included)\" was added to the first paragraph to make it clear that my overall experience with the game was negative.

Many people see the grid puzzles on panels and assume that this is the essence of the gameplay. In this review, I aim to illuminate parts of the nature of the game, providing you with a clearer understanding before diving into it. There are no spoilers about the story.\n\nBefore delving into the review, it's worth briefly mentioning games such as The Talos Principle or Portal. These games follow a linear structure with intricate puzzles that are largely self-contained. Players can solve one puzzle today and return ten days later to tackle another, making the gameplay quite straightforward. The quality of these games predominantly hinges on the complexity and ingenuity of the puzzles.\n\nOn the other hand, The Witness is clearly inspired by the Myst series and takes a quite unconventional approach that we aren't really used to. The journey starts with the character who has 'amnesia' and needs to explore an island to figure out what is going on. \n\n[b]- Part 1: Intro -[/b]\n\nThe island is divided into multiple regions, each featuring a set of challenges grouped around a common theme. If the player encounters difficulty with a particular set, they have the flexibility to bypass it and explore other parts of the island. This design creates a highly non-linear experience and balances exploration with puzzle solving by allowing players to gradually expand their knowledge of the world and return to previously unsolved challenges. Importantly, players are not penalized for being unable to complete a puzzle; progress can still be made, and the game can be successfully completed even with many of them left unsolved.\n\nNow, not all puzzles are easy to identify. The most common ones are found on panels of various forms within specific regions, typically grouped together and must be completed in a sequential order, with the complexity of the puzzles gradually increasing. Trial and error is employed for the simple challenges and logic is applied for the more complicated ones. This process aids the player in making sense of their rules. However, in some cases, the solution does not depend solely on the information presented on the panel, but on the environment as well.\n\nOn the opposite end, there are also numerous hidden challenges that are not presented in the standard panel form and require from the player to interact with the environment in some way, offering a welcome break from the panel puzzle-solving monotony.\n\nThe game's story unfolds through scattered audio logs across the island. Instead of straightforwardly conveying the narrative to players, these logs are deliberately enigmatic, presenting the story as quotes from influential thinkers. The player will also come across a theater and watch video clips.\n\nAs we can see, The Witness isn't just a sequence of puzzles; rather, it features multiple layers of puzzles, suggesting a more complex and intricate structure to the gameplay.\n\n[b]- Part 2: Bird's eye view -[/b]\n\nSo what type of game is The Witness? While solving the panel puzzles may seem pretty straightforward, discovering requires the player to slow down and be very observant of the surroundings. The audio logs are scattered randomly, and so are some panels. Many puzzles are hidden in plain sight, and there are also hidden rooms with extra puzzles. The more you play, the more you'll come across things that you missed because you weren't paying enough attention. Rest assured, there's a lot to discover, more than you could ever imagine. If you are stuck or frustrated, you are encouraged to take a break\u2014perhaps move on to another area, or simply pause for a moment to enjoy the serene landscape. Its phenomenal attention to detail makes it feel like a piece of art; in a sense, it is. Ultimately, it is a game that constantly reminds us that we should live in the moment. It's peaceful, relaxing, meditative, and challenging at the same time. It's one of those experiences where the process of solving puzzles and uncovering the island's secrets is as rewarding as reaching the end.\n\nThe Witness also explores the process of learning. The game throws players into an adventure with no explicit instructions, setting the tone for a self-guided experience. Most regions introduce an independent and simple core concept. Upon completing one area, players are confident that they understand how to apply the rules learned to another one. Yet, as the game progresses, these concepts seamlessly merge, requiring application of knowledge across different areas.\n\nThis mirrors the learning process, akin to assembling smaller building blocks. The game's quality lies in refreshing the joy of learning, reminding players that learning is about discovery and understanding, a sentiment often overlooked in contemporary education. Consequently, it makes for an excellent choice for children.\n\n[b]- Part 3: Outro -[/b]\n\nNow, as with most titles, this one too has its shortcomings. Solving those panel puzzles can and will get tedious at some point. The reason for this is twofold: first, there are too many of them, and second, these puzzles aren't as sophisticated as the complex ones you'll encounter in games like The Talos Principle or Portal. Consequently, solving them doesn't feel very satisfying, although this is probably subjective. In a sense, the game distributes its difficulty across the entire island. Lastly, some puzzles can be a bit trickier or challenging, almost reaching the point of being unfair. Even if you know the rules, you may find yourself unable to solve them. All this reminds us of the challenges inherent in learning something new; the smaller building blocks are often boring and may be the source of frustration.\n\nHaving said all that, The Witness stands out as one of the few games I've played that didn't leave me feeling intellectually inadequate. This isn't by accident; it's by design. The introduction of panel puzzle mechanics, through solving puzzles of increasing difficulty, essentially serves as a tutorial. However, it never really feels like a traditional one. As a result, the primary challenge in most situations lies not in the complexity of the tasks but in the player's understanding of the rules and, consequently, the world around them. Also, unlike traditional adventure games like Myst, there's no need for \"pixel hunting\", as it's always evident what you can click on.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this game isn't for everyone. If you approach it solely as a race to solve puzzles on panels and rush towards the end, chances are it won't resonate with you. However, if you're the type of player who relishes taking their time, finding joy in games rich with exploration, and appreciating them as an art form, then The Witness might be the perfect fit for you. That's the reason the game doesn't place stringent demands. On one hand, it presents a world, encouraging exploration and the discovery of numerous elements. On the other hand, players are at liberty to finish the game without necessarily uncovering many of its intricacies. However, by doing so, you'll likely miss out on understanding why you are on this island in the first place.\n\nTherefore, my suggestion is to take it slow and uncover as much as you can. As you delve deeper, your knowledge will likely grow, leading to a clearer and more coherent grasp of the narrative. In the end, while understanding the story should be relatively straightforward, discerning the deeper meaning(s) of the game is not entirely obvious :)\n\nGood luck!\n\n---\n\n** If you have a color vision deficiency or are tone deaf, some puzzles will pose an extra challenge.

However, in my view, the environmental puzzles are the weakest part of this game. They don't require logic; instead, they demand a keen eye and pixel hunting, which quickly becomes tedious. In my opinion, the author is a very talented person, but he failed to realize the difference between SOLVING and SEARCHING. Searching and pixel hunting quickly become boring and tiring. I'm a big fan of puzzle games, but there's a limit to how much time I'm willing to invest in a game. The Witness requires an excessive amount of meticulous exploring and peering into the landscape if you aim to complete it 100%.\n\nSo, here's my advice for all newcomers to the game: try the minimal walkthrough on your own (you can finish the game without completing all puzzles), and resort to guides if you aim to finish it 100%. This approach will unveil some interesting endings and game content. Trust me \u2013 it doesn't make sense to finish it 100% on your own because it will take an enormous amount of time on average. Plus, you will clearly see (if you follow the guides on environmental puzzles) how much time a puzzle would have taken you if you attempted it on your own.\n\nTo sum it up \u2013 overall, I like this game; perhaps only Myst surpasses it. But what I don't appreciate is that it becomes tedious at some point, and we, as human beings, just don't like to hit our head against the wall without making any progress.

For music, for plays, for books, they have typically been seen as extensions of the other. \"All art aspires to the condition of music\" because music was seen as the most experiential of the forms, unperturbed by the various structures and limitations placed on theatre and literature. Film, arguably, held the position upon it's realisation to challenge music. Where music was pure audio - and open to experimentation with the lack of a defined structure outside of time - film could occupy the same unstructured space in both audio AND visual.\n\nThe 20th century saw many revolutions in film. We went from live orchestra accompaniment to the evolution of the talkie. From the musicals of the immediate talkie era to surrealism of Fellini, Tarkovsky, right through to present day Lynch. True experimentation with the audio visual medium that arguably continues. Animation could be seen as a route to unlocking it, the merging of it with live action giving further potential. Some might argue the opposite, but the argument exists both ways and that is the point.\n\nWe pay extra to see live orchestra accompaniments now. To relive those early revolutionary days of film. Maybe that is the sign of some kind of limit being approached.\n\nVideo games are the great new medium of the 21st century. We are, in the 2010s and 2020s, in a similar manner to film in the 1910s and 1920s. Great works that stand the test of time are barely now being created. They are incredible compared to Pong and Tetris yes, but they are still starting points for games as art. Something like Baldurs Gate could be seen as something like Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. But this is in the sense of narrative, scope, in becoming to film what film became to theatre. For gaming to become what film is to film, we have to go more foundationally.\n\nGames are not experiential like film and music. Games are experience itself. They are fictional, yes, but so too is the daily experience of you and me. When you use your computer, you are using rocks with lightning passing through it. What makes it a computer is your experience of it. It only exists in your head, and the head of those who agree with you. The words on this screen become words only through your experience, otherwise it is light and plastic. Light and plastic, too, are simply arbitary groupings of real phenomena that help us further describe the world. What you go through in life is not reality itself but reality through a lense of fiction. With art, we create further fictions. With gaming, we can create the true experience of existing through them.\n\nThe Witness strips gaming down to this core fundamental. A simple circle and line, oft repeating, in various forms and puzzles. It is no mistake that it begins with simple puzzles on a screen - and make no mistake, this is not where the challenges end.\n\nThat is what The Witness is about. Not Tao Buddhism or anything like that, at it's core it is about the fundamental potential of video games as an art form - and it is it's own best example.\n\nYes, the art style is great. Yes, the atmosphere is brilliant. Yes, the challenges themselves - as they must - are fantastically inventive. But this is not what The Witness brings to the table that is new. Plenty of games challenge the greatest works of film, theatre, literature, music, and art itself in these aspects. The Witness attempts to warp your perception of reality itself in a simple manner, committed to with astonishing deliberateness, and in doing so unlock your view of gaming's potential to do just the same. If all experience is fiction, then the fictions you experience in gaming have the unique potential to carry through with you even after you stop playing.\n\nIn this, gaming can truly be life changing.\n\nI do not know if video games will ever reach this potential. If they do, The Witness will be looked back on as the pioneer that started it all.\n\nHave you ever seen a solar eclipse?", "timestamp_created": 1701008840, "timestamp_updated": 1701012891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725290596485137939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148213138": {"recommendationid": "148213138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436922266", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2175, "last_played": 1697592317}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how challenging this game is, but I have one complaint.

If you don't like experimental weird shit games, don't get it.  \n\nThe Witness is hard to describe.  A large open world that you wander around in solving puzzles.  Why do you solve the puzzles?  Some times you can see that they lead to something, some times you do them because, well, this is a puzzle game and you found a puzzle.  The entire game is built upon a slowly increasing knowledge base, where you solve an extremely simple puzzle, then a slightly more complex one, until you learn the rules of that type of puzzle.  You might need to look at the puzzles from different angles, or listen carefully to sounds, but you can't even carry objects so don't worry about fetch quests.   Every puzzle in the game is totally self contained, once you understand the rules.  Like a Myst game, keeping a notebook is a must.  It has no characters in the traditional sense.  No big face slaps of \"I AM TEACHING YOU PHILOSOPHY\" like The Talos Principle. But it has strong theme, expression, and intent. \n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Dear god the motion sickness.  I don't get motion sickness from games, but hooooooly crap did I have to stop playing this multiple times because it made me sick.  This is especially true with some of the very late game puzzles.  The worst part of the game by far for me.\n\n-Difficulty that can be frustrating.  Almost nothing in the game is difficult in the traditional sense.  What makes the game hard is figuring out the rules, and if you don't know a rule it becomes next to impossible.  Figuring out some of them can be a challenge.\n\n-Nothing is explained in the traditional sense.  The reviews that say there are no tutorials are wrong; the entire game is a giant set of tutorials.  But you need to pay attention to every thing you do, in every puzzle, and what it means.  Woe to you if you didn't write down your discoveries. \n\n-It's slow.  Think Myst, if you played that back in the day.  Moving through spaces, exploring them, piecing together from the environment what you are supposed to even do there, if anything.  \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n-Do you like learning through doing, rather than having something explained to you?  That's the game.  That's literally the entire game.  And I mean it.  It is 30+ hours of tinkering and experimenting and [i]OH SHIT I GET IT![/i] moments where suddenly 3 of the puzzles you left behind, stuck, suddenly make sense and are child's play.  Along each of those you will discover something else and another puzzle you couldn't figure out just clicks into place.  Or maybe what you discover is a puzzle you didn't even realize was there, but you were staring at the whole time! [b]And you get lost in it.[/b]\n\n-It's beautiful.  Incredible art direction with layers and layers and layers.\n\n-It has a hard to quantify human \"art feel\".  The frustrations, and the journey.  The realizations about the game and about yourself.  It'll do things to you that suck, and it'll do things to you that are wonderful.  When I beat one of the endings I literally had to stand up and walk away from my computer. \n\n\n[b]A few ending notes[/b]\nLooking up almost anything immediately breaks the game.  This can be extremely hard to deal with in a context where the answer to not understanding something is to just look it up.  A few times in the game I \"solved\" things a bit faster than the game intended and had to slog through a dozen puzzles of ramping difficulty.  If you just look up how a mechanic works, all you're doing is slogging through puzzles that take longer to walk between than to solve.

The exploration is pretty great; one of my favorite things about The Witness is that I was able to drop in, find puzzles that were stimulating and challenging, then wander off and discover new puzzles when I became stuck on certain sections. The game also plays with perspective, light, environmental features, and other details to create puzzles that sometimes lead to these really rewarding \"ah ha\" moments when you solve them. There were a few times that I'd get rolling and finish an entire section or string of puzzles very quickly, and that feeling is quite priceless: simply put, moments like that make you feel genius. A lot of the challenge comes from the puzzle mechanics not being explained by the game, rather you figure them out by experimenting and solving easier puzzles that partially inform you as to how certain mechanics work. That might be a turn off to some, but I think it works pretty well and gives you more incentive to explore the island. \n\nThat being said, I thought The Witness also had some glaring flaws. The puzzles I found most infuriating are ones where the challenge comes from the puzzle being heavily visually obstructed, rather than the puzzle itself requiring a hard-thought solution. Another great example of a type of puzzle I found very annoying were spinning/moving puzzles, where the solution would be pretty simple to find, but trying to input the solution became a major pain because of how the movement effects the controls. A final example is sound puzzles, which were an interesting addition, but feel a bit out of place when compared to everything else, and will be difficult for those who aren't great at quickly identifying and comparing differently pitched sounds. I didn't look for accessibility settings, but if you are at all colorblind, have vision issues, or hearing issues, that could really hurt your enjoyment of The Witness, or render certain section unsolvable without looking up solutions which is a real shame. A final gripe I have with The Witness is that when you beat the game, it resets the entire game. Many games that do this will have some sort of pop-up screen that lets you know that you are triggering a point of no return, unfortunately there is nothing like that here. That is particularly annoying for someone like me who was looking forward to going for the 100%, and now I have to resolve everything or get solutions to everything I already solved to return to the state I was in.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy puzzle games and what you've seen of The Witness looks interesting to you, then I think you'd probably enjoy it. It does a stellar job of presenting many challenges that you can easily drop and and out of. I also love how the game essentially teaches you an entire puzzle language through game play rather than text. The Witness is an extremely unique experience, and I'm not surprised it made such a splash back when it launched. To me it was gaming comfort food that also made me think and repeatedly impressed me with unique mechanics and puzzles, even though there are undoubtedly some duds along the way.\n\n[b]Recommended[/b]\n\n[i]If you found my review helpful, please consider following my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44234346/]Steam Curator page[/url] where you can see more thoughts and recommendations[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1702429386, "timestamp_updated": 1702429425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620932936668395996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154655989": {"recommendationid": "154655989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164719008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1413, "last_played": 1704016376}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a real game.

The game reveals its difference with a maximum of 10 different mechanics that it can build on this foundation.\n\n\u274cAlthough having so many mechanics sounds like a good thing, the game does not try to teach you these mechanics at all, and although you do not question this at first (5 hours), as the game progresses, you start playing a game where you do not know what you are doing and why. In easy puzzles intended to teach mechanics, you try to find a solution entirely through trial and error and create a rule in your own mind. However, while your rule is valid in simple puzzles, it does not work in complex puzzles. Because you have no idea whether your rule is correct or not.\n\n\u2753Since our game takes place in an open world full of puzzles, you can start from any biome you want. Each biome has its own unique mechanics, but in the later puzzles of some biomes, you have to leave the biome when different mechanics are included in the puzzles. Since the game does not hold the player's hand at all, you do not know which biome to start from and where to learn which mechanics.\n\n\u274cSince the basis of the game is based on a very simple logic, the puzzles start to repeat themselves. Although the game tries to keep itself fresh with various mechanics, since the developer wants to fill every part of the game with puzzles, when you encounter these mechanics both in their own biomes and in different biomes, it is inevitable for them to become repetitive and instead of giving you the feeling of solving a puzzle, it gives you the feeling of doing the same thing in a different way. And after a while the it feels suck.\n\n\u2b50[b]A good puzzle game should open the player's mind and push him to think differently with every new puzzle it presents to the player. This game loves to be repetitive.[/b]\n\n\n\u2705 Let's talk about what the game did best for me and gave me a reason to finish the game:\n[b]\"Environmental Puzzles\"[/b]\nEnvironmental puzzles are puzzles that use the basic logic of the game not only in the puzzles but in the entire open world. As I said, \"The developer wanted to fill every part of the game with puzzles\", that's exactly it. So any circle shape you see in the world can be the starting point of a puzzle for you. Although these puzzles are much simpler than the mechanical puzzles that the game tries to make, they are the only type of puzzles that make the player think.\n\n\u2705 In order to find the puzzles in the environment, you may sometimes have to change the perspective, sometimes your angle, sometimes your location. Sometimes seek it from reflections, sometimes its light plays, and sometimes the environment, and these push the player to think differently and expand his view. Environmental puzzles are mind-expanding and well-thought-out puzzles.\n\n\u274c If you are a player like me who wants to experience everything in games, you can follow these puzzles on obelisks and find out what you missed on the internet. Even though I did most of them, there were some that I missed, but the solutions to the puzzles I missed were so absurd that I can say that this mechanic has been screwed. It is impossible not to be surprised by the minds of those who think about the puzzle and find the solution after reaching the solution.\n\n\ud83d\udcdf You may not know that there is a story in the game, because discovering this story is completely left to you, just like discovering the mechanics. However, the story it is trying to tell is quite empty and unnecessary.\n\n\u23ed To summarize, the game is a game that asks you to solve puzzles by putting different mechanics on the same basis. Although it is a very catchy game with its environmental puzzles, the fact that it does not hold the player's hand and constantly falls into repetition undermines these beautiful aspects of the game.\n\n\u2b50 As someone who solved 520 of the 523 puzzles and 130 of the 135 environmental puzzles in the game, and who learned the mechanics completely while finishing the \"Challange Room\", I can say that this game is overrated, it is not a good puzzle game, and on an island filled to the brim with puzzles, the same mechanics are bored. .\n\u2757 [b]\"Too many cooks spoil the soup\"[/b] \u2757\n\n\ud83d\udc4d[b][i]Don't forget to check out the game \"The Looker\" inspired by The Witness but much better designed![/i][/b]\n\n[spoiler][h3][b][u]ENDING[/u]: Man!

It's game design and concepts should be studied and emulated (mostly). The puzzles are interesting and fair (mostly), the environments are pretty. And it has one of the single, greatest AHA moments that truly changes how you see the game.\n\nSo why do I not recommend it. Because I truly feel like it doesn't respect you or your time, and that AHA moment quickly became the most tedious part of the game, which ruins it in hindsight. Look, you play a puzzle game for the puzzles, and that's what this is. Just puzzles. You learn the rules in different areas, exploring and backtracking as the only limit is your own knowledge. Truly, that's where the game shines, and that's what other developers should take from it (like Taiji.)\n\nThe problem is my expectations, where it felt like it was teasing more. A hidden story to unlock if you only solve just a few more puzzles. The areas were so interesting, so much environmental story telling, and yet, looking back, there was no story to tell. Audio logs drone on while you wait for baited breath to figure out why you were listening to it to begin with. And yet, in the end, *Spoilers* it's just a dream. \n\nThe game wants you to think about Perspectives. And it does this well. But man, screw those audio logs. Screw the \"puzzle\" that had you actively wait (I mean, you can't do anything else) for an HOUR of tracing. Screw THAT audio puzzle (you know the one). Screw every slow moving boat, or bridge, or door, or elevator, or windmill that ate my life away 30 seconds at a time. Doors unlock to nowhere after long puzzle chains with no reward besides finishing the puzzles themselves. It just feels pretentious,  much like this review.

In synthesis, it is just a game about connecting lines. But the never ending shades of puzzle designs that intertwine between these simple starting and ending points are so well constructed and so exhaustive that they will make you feel like some sort of human algorithm trying to solve problems over and over again. A machine, or something along those lines.\n\nI think that if you want the definitive puzzle experience, something to push you out of your comfort zone, something that lets you rethink the way you approach obstacles, you will love The Witness.
