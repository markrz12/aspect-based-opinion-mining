We found that this one was on the cheaper side and rated very well, so decided to give it a try. We both loved it.\n\nThe story was outstanding. There were no jump-scares per say, but the atmosphere was definitely creepy and at some points I was a little freaked out, which I loved. The puzzles were absolutely 10/10 amazing for co-op, nothing ever got frustrating, and it just worked really well the way it's all laid out and designed. Absolutely worth the money and we WILL be playing it again with me in the other role/with the other insect, possibly doing it 2x more for all achievements. Absolutely outstanding and we both hope to see more co-op puzzle games like this from this developer.\n\nIf you want a sort of comparison, it's a TINY bit like a simplified version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, but without a time limit/inherent danger. There is one timed puzzle but it's not that difficult and if you fail, you just start over. As far as we could tell, nothing can stop your progression permanently.

I had to say that I am a little disappointed with this one. \nPros:\n1. Sound design is awesome as always. I preferred music from the white door but this one is still great. \n2. The environment is doing its job perfectly. I really got spooked a few times. \n3. The 3D part is pretty cool and also new experience for old rusty lake players. \n4. I had fun with my partner. I like that we need to communicate to solve puzzles.\n5. My partner has never played rusty lake series and he did enjoyed the game and won't complain about it. \n\nMixed: The multi player part isn't synced or connected which I don't really care. It's not a priority for me at least. It's just a bit confusing when the game tell both of you to do something at exactly the same time. \n\nCons:\n1. The play time is really short even compared with other rusty lake games. I finished the game with my partner for about one hour (butterfly mode). We bought the game for a 40% discount so 3.5$ each so I won't complain too much. However, if I bought this at full price, I'd feel a bit more disappointed. \n\n2. The play time would be fine with me if there are more puzzles and story elements in the game. On the contrary, the puzzles are quite simple. Most of the story we already know from past games. Maybe I missed some lore but I feel like there isn't much to say about the story. \n\n3. Some of the puzzles are simply redundant. There are multiple puzzles that are just letting you repeat the same instruction times and times again, which isn't really fun. It can be a little frustrating. \n\n4. There's not much point in trying both modes to be honest. Both butterfly and bee has same puzzles only, of course, you get a bee or a butterfly model. The answers may change sequence but it's really the same thing. My partner and I finished both mode in 2 hours. \n\n5. The 3D part is cool but I have to be honest, I'm not that impressed. Different games (the room for example) have done similar things before. It's not bad but it's not impressive enough to let me ignore the previous points. \n\nOverall, I don't think I would recommend this game to a new player at this moment. My partner didn't complain about it and think it's okay. But he did say he probably wouldn't buy this if I didn't want to play it (I gifted him one). If you really really do love the rusty lake lore and want to dive deep into the details, sure this game isn't that bad.

One of you is in the past and the other in the future and your father Albert has left instructions on how to make a connection between two different years and another sinister instruction and so you set out to make his wish into a reality. \n\nThe story is very minimal in The Past Within, there's definitely a little bit more added lore to the Rusty Lake series. but this time around it's a lot more gameplay focused. I did like what's here, there's some genuinely good story advancements and I'm really excited to see where the next game in the series will go next.\n\nGraphics:\n\nVisually The Past Within also tries something new just like The White Door did and this time around Rusty Lake goes 3D. There's still the same 2D segments designed the same way they were in in the other games in the series. And generally the style is just as good as it ever was, however this time around it's a little less surreal.\n\nThe 3D environments however are amazing. I genuinely loved how great the world of Rusty Lake translated into 3D and seeing some of the visuals that you kept looking at throughout the franchise in fluid 3D was quite the trip and I definitely loved how the unique atmosphere each side gets. \n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio design is generally pretty good and the issues of the franchise like audio crunch has gone away with this entry. There's some decent background music that's not intrusive when trying to communicate with your partner. It's actually very nice and does add to the creepy atmosphere even further.\n\nThere's some other sound effects, but generally they're either taken from the other games or so minor that they're not really worth talking about. It's made to be as less annoying on the ears as possible to make it easier to communicate which is nice, but when do you hear sound effects they're pretty decent.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIn the past, the Rusty Lake games were single player experiences where you solved puzzles all by your lonesome, however this time around you're bringing a friend into the nightmarish world of the Lake to help you out with the puzzles. There's still the standard type of puzzles you'll have to solve yourself, but a lot of the game is designed to be tackled with a partner. \n\nSo let's begin with the puzzles. Rusty Lake games have often been very complex and had their surreal nature bleed into it. The Past Within puzzles are a lot more streamlined and much more simple than anything the franchise ever had. This was probably done to make it much easier to describe to player and honestly while the puzzles were much easier, they were still a great time.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are probably the biggest negative the game has about it. It's pretty easy overall as you pick up what you need to do almost straight away with only a few puzzles having a stump in difficulty and even then the solution for them is basically a massive hint, you just need to find where to use it.\n\nAlso it's quite great that this game technically can be played up to 4 times per side as there's two different puzzle settings and then the past and the future which amounts to a decent amount of play value with a single playthrough taking up to 2 hours, so you can really maximize how much you and your friend get out of the title.\n\nAlso quite a lot of the jank the series used to have is also gone and is a lot more refined. I really hope that the series uses this engine going forward as this generally felt like the most fluid Rusty Lake game to date and I really liked more advanced gameplay. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Past Within is a great addition to the Rusty Lake series and a brilliant co-op experience if you and your friend likes puzzle games. While it's a bit too easy than the other games in the series and has some weak design choices, it's yet another worthy trip to the Lake. \n\nFinal Rating:\n9/10\n\nPros:\n+ Visuals are a mix of old and new and mesh very well\n+ Some really fun puzzles\n+ Story has some interesting developments to the lore \n+ Audio design is great and doesn't intrude when solving puzzles\n\nCons:\n- A lot of the puzzles are too easy \n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews\n", "timestamp_created": 1677103298, "timestamp_updated": 1677103298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708268940448760986", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131234677": {"recommendationid": "131234677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416559924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1672707809}, "language": "english", "review": "help dad's crawling on the walls again", "timestamp_created": 1674254867, "timestamp_updated": 1674254867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688405275344848633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138535663": {"recommendationid": "138535663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965837789", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 3025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3025, "last_played": 1684018239}, "language": "english", "review": "The Past Within is an asymmetrical co-op point & click puzzle game where you play with your partner in either the past and the future and solve puzzles to uncover Albert Vanderboom\u2019s plan.

Searching around like a madman for inputs/outputs that sync up with your partner's.\n2. Repeating step-by-step basic instructions to your partner or receiving instructions and doing exactly what your partner/the game tells you to do.\n3. Repeat for 2 hours\n\nAlso, you might want to consider reducing how much you make the players repeat tasks. There's a reason why, in most games, players are tested on new concepts simultaneously with ramping difficulty or complexity until they master it and can integrate it into other game elements.\n\nThis game does no such thing. Instead, you're made to repeat chores with your partner over and over again with little variation or challenge. The \"challenge\" lies in the fact that you cannot see your partner's screen.\n\nFor example, there's a chore where you read clock hands to your partner and they set a clock accordingly on their end. I know how to set a clock, so it wasn't even fun the first time. Why then, game, do you make us do it like eight goddamn times? WE ALREADY MASTERED THE ART OF SETTING CLOCKS, GAME.\n\nThere are many other small tasks that players are made to repeat many times, such as the XYZ puzzles or the dials with symbols on them. This is genuinely upsetting and shows a lack of respect for the player's time. Many tasks are repeated over and over again, and not a single one of them constitutes a puzzle or requires critical thinking.\n\nIt almost feels like padding to exceed the refund window. And bravo, you got me, game. I am aware it's only $6, but it feels like I am owed money for playing this to the end.\n\nArguably, the most critical thinking you'll use in this game is filtering what information is relevant to your partner. However, this mostly devolves into a brute force approach where we just rattle off everything we see, and it quickly becomes annoying.\n\nThe initial premise was interesting, and the atmosphere enhanced it, but next to nothing was done with it in this work, leaving a hollow shell of nothing happening.

DISAPPOINTMENT GUARANTEED!\n\nMy friend and I recently purchased this game after being HUGE fans of the Rusty Lake games for a while, and couldn't contain our excitement at a co-op version. \n\nThis game only let us down at every turn. There are only TWO CHAPTERS, which not only is shocking for a paid game (at least make it 3 game devs, what are we paying for?) but it takes less than an hour to solve EACH because they were so easy!!!\n\nThe puzzles WERE NOT ALSO NOT PUZZLES! Instead, the way the game works is that between you and your game partner, it just easy call-and-response, listen-and-repeat, a click-and-point style solving system, which essentially made the game tedious as you were waiting for your partner to give you numbers to type in so you could give your partner numbers to type in. No puzzle solving or critical thinking at all.\n\nThere was also NO VARIATION, with some 'puzzles' being milked for all they are worth, such as the dial 'puzzle' which had to be played like 6-8 times in a row? Could we not have done something else?\n\nFinally, this game is an absolute rip off of KEEP TALKING AND NOBODY EXPLODES, with you as the player rotating a 3D box with 'puzzles' on it as if it hadn't been done before. Rusty Lake is so original with its horror concept, but this copying really let us down.\n\nOverall, both of us are really disappointed and will be asking for refunds.

If you want to dive in without any further knowledge, well... I'll say that it's a interesting experience and you'll have a great time.\n\nIf you want to hear more, here are some top of mind pieces of feedback.\n\nIf you want to see more indie games, many of which I've reviewed, please check out my youtube channel. \nLink [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMd490dpLAJxONpEpvOMnw] here [/url] and after my closing thoughts!\n\n[h3]Addressing Co-Op[/h3]\nIt's safe to assume that many wondered if The Past Within would retain that classic, Rusty Lake feeling while at the same time being cooperative in nature. \n\nRest assured, it does. \n\nEverything screams Rusty Lake as usual, and the atmosphere is more pronounced here than it was in The White Door, which in and on itself was still a great experience, even if different. Being cooperative isn't necessarily the way to go for this series, but it's been around for so long and with so many titles that this feels like an exciting, fresh experience on top of already successful and interesting games.\n\nWith that said, cooperation comes at a cost: complexity. While The White Door was certainly different from the more classic feel of The Past Within, I'm afraid the latter did sacrifice much of its complexity in order to mantain the cooperative structure. \nThat's perfectly fine and I can see why they went this route, since your friend/partner/whatever may not be used to play Rusty Lake at all and could have an odd time figuring things out. That has been my personal experience, at least. \n\nBeing used to the common puzzle structure amongst the series, I've found a gap between me and my partner in how puzzles are approached. With that said, I still think that going the easy route with its estimated 2 hour length may have hurt longevity a little.\n\nGiven how much it costs, though, there's no reason to be mad about it or anything like that. \nIt's just my personal consideration, and I've enjoyed everything it had to offer and its cooperative structure more than I expected!\n\n[h3]The Past Is In The Future[/h3]\nTo my knowledge, this is the first 3D Rusty Lake game. And they absolutely nailed it. Actually, you'll have a mix of 2D and 3D based on which timeline you start with. Eventually, you'll switch from one dimension to the other... but I can't stress enough about how well it mantains that Rusty Lake feeling while being transposed to 3D. \n\nFrom a game design perspective, I can see the challenges that may have been presented during development. Whatever they've done, it paid off. The cube concept is really cool! And it has many things to do in such a condensed space, at least enough to carry half a game. \n\nEven though I've talked about how easy puzzles are, I'll say that the concept overcomes this aspect in many way, providing insight to interesting choices design-wise which can and will keep you entertained for its interesting yet brief duration.\n\nFor my playthrough I've chosen the butterfly and I've started off in the future. Interesting pick, and I'm satisfied with it! When I'll have the chance, I'll replay through the other perspective. \n\n[h3]Atmosphere[/h3]\nThank you, Victor Butzelaar! \nRusty Lake always had amazing, eerie and distinctive piano sections. It's interesting to see that the soundtrack manages to get better at each iteration of this series, and I can't express how well thought it feels and, of course, is. \n\nI think I've reviewed every Rusty Lake game, if I'm not wrong. I always wonder what they'll come up with, since this is an evolving story, filled with mystery and eerieness. Story-wise, The Past Within is extremely important and, for me, has set up a whole interesting area which I can't wait to explore. \n\nOf course, the game is very peculiar in some ways. It retains some of that \"flash game\" feeling, something many players wouldn't really like nowadays, but I think this series evolved just right and it now has (since Roots, as far as I'm concerned) a distinctive character surrounding it. \n\n[h3]Closing Thoughts[/h3]\nPoint and click games aren't for everyone, as they could come across as \"boring\" since there's a lot of stuff to do. \nBut I would invite you to invest some time in the Rusty Lake lore and learn about each piece of media that has been presented until now. \n\nI'm sure you'll find it interesting!\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended/]More reviews here![/url]\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMd490dpLAJxONpEpvOMnw]My YT channel[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1668028056, "timestamp_updated": 1668028196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125182252": {"recommendationid": "125182252", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241427985", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1667974679}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool game!

Each puzzle gives you enough clues to guide you seamlessly to the next one. Each player constantly needs to give information to the other one in order to proceed so there are no big gaps that one of you gets bored by doing nothing.\n- Simplistic, but cool and mysterious small story that keeps you interested till the end.\n- It has a weird, eerie atmosphere with some creepy moments.\n- Nice calm music.\n\nThe bad\n- Puzzles have a few interesting mechanics, but they are pretty easy and not so creative. They're mostly pattern matches, and codes based on descriptions between players. If they describe things well, puzzles' get solved almost instantly. It doesn't require much though or imagination. It doesn't have clever objects combinations.\n- It could be so much better with online co-op where the actions of one player affect automatically his mate's room.

The biggest problem is the puzzles. They're just not challenging or particularly clever. They also get quite repetitive once you, for instance, get the idea of putting in a code, they pointlessly make you repeat that 4-5x in one puzzle quest, let alone, coming back to the same puzzle again and again.

For a small game, it keeps a very creepy atmosphere but not overly scary if that makes sense. The idea that you don't know whats going to happen but you can't die just keeps you at the edge of your seat. The puzzles were all very fun however sometimes it took a long time to understand or you may have to search stuff up. The overall story is really good and just made for a great game to play with someone. I wish it was longer but for being so short it has dearly touched my heart. Shoutout to everyone who made the game !!\n\nMy boyfriends feedback [playing the future] : He says it was good, we'd both play it again, taking the bee side and switching sides! He was incredibly impressed with it for being such a small game. He did say that it wasn't as scary and felt a little bored when i was saying all this creepy stuff was happening. But overall he liked it.\n\nOverall: 5/5!

The past within. Communicating through the circle of time to achieve resurrection, the devs create a new game with a brand new co-op perspective, great design. The past is in the future, the future is in the past. The past [b]with&in[/b] the future. The game seems an explanation about the saying \"[i]The past is never dead, it's not even past.[/i]\"\n\nThe gameplay is actually the easiest one compared to the prequels, to make the co-op work well for most of us. Thus if we don't follow or care about the story, we may intend to say the puzzles are not that interesting and only about exchanging information. So I would like to say the devs made a choice, a new co-op pattern and preference for the story rather than difficult riddles. If the riddles are solid hard, this game probably only works for smart guys 1. who is willing to play alone 2. who have smart friends so no one has to wait for a long time.\n\nTo conclude, in the game the characters create the elixir, it works but only has a 1/2 chance. While in real life the developers create the rusty lake games, they are attractive and absolutely do not appeal to everyone.\n\n[spoiler]In the future, it takes me some time to realize we have to click 5 times to turn on the tap, yeah, an old-time tap.

The gap is closed[/h1]\n\nIt's the only Rusty Lake game you can play with a friend. It is a co-op game where you can play either in the future or in the past. A network connection is not a must but you need a mean of communication to give each other the hints you find around to proceed the game. The story about Rose who will carry on her father's Albert Vanderboom plan, help her through multiple puzzles with your friend to unravel the mystery. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3172885749\n\nThis new experience is exciting, especially with the cooperative puzzles that can be played cross-platforms with your friend. One of the players will play the classic 2d with a creepy atmosphere like how all Rusty lake games plays, and the other will have the 3d mode where he'll have a huge cube with multiple puzzles which can't be solved without a friend's help. There is no in-game chat, you'll have to use either discord or any other communication mean. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3172885161\n\nI always enjoy the game's atmospheric soundtracks, this game was no different, the music fits the creepy atmosphere well. I also liked the concept of this game, which you'll understand by the end. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3172885969\n\nPros:\n+Interesting side of Albert Vanderboom and his daughter Rose.\n+Co-op gameplay (Two players must play the game, and is cross-platform, with no need for an internet connection)\n+Good soundtracks.\n+Variety of puzzles.\n+Eeirie atmosphere.\n+Steam achievements.\n\nCons:\n-The story could be confusing; you must play the series' other games to understand it.\n-No hinting system. Sometimes, you get stuck and don't know what to do next.\n\nAlthough the game is short, the experience was good and some of the parts were surprising, I highly recommend playing both sides to understand the story more, each side gameplay takes about two hours, in total four hours to beat the game. Some of the achievements are tricky though, you might need a guide to get them all. \n\n[i]Other Reviews:[/i]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/1292940/]Cube Escape Collection Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/435120/]Rusty Lake Hotel Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/532110/]Rusty Lake: Roots Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/744190/]Rusty Lake Paradise Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/909080/]Cube Escape: Paradox Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/1145960/]The White Door Review[/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071375554/recommended/2291850?snr=1_5_9__402]Underground Blossom Review[/url]\n\n\n[quote]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc50\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32399565/]\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e'\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc36\ud835\ude29\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52[/url][/quote]\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32732116-IndieGems/] Follow [b]IndieGems[/b] [/url] for more reviews like this one.

In the game, we have to uncover the secrets of Albert Vanderboom, a deceased man, and in order to discover them we have to join forces with another player who is in the future or the past (the choice depends on us and our partner). On the other hand, we don't need to connect with the other player to complete further puzzles, but only need text or voice communication to do so.\n\nIn general, the game features well-crafted puzzles that require communication with another player to complete. They are often based on the mapping of some patterns. They are not difficult puzzles, but completing each successive one is really satisfying. They are also logical and related to the game's plot. However, over time they can become monotonous.\n\nThe graphics of the game are very nice. The game has its own extravagant style, and depending on whether you play in the future or the past, you play in either 2D or 3D mode, which is intuitive and I didn't encounter any bugs in either mode.\n\nSound-wise it is also very good, we have dubbing and a pleasant soundtrack, on top of that the ambient sounds are equally good.\n\nWe can go through the game from two perspectives and, on top of that, by choosing one of the insects, which gives a total of four possible passages of the game, although they are not too different from each other. However, the choice of insects is not very important, it slightly changes some of the puzzles. Therefore, I recommend going through the game twice: in the future and in the past.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nThe Past Within is a really good game. It is not a game that is difficult, the subsequent puzzles were not a difficulty for me and my friend, but we had fun playing it, which is what it is all about. Plus the lack of bugs, a good atmosphere and the evening passed quickly and pleasantly.\n[b]\n\u2714\ufe0fSpecific, nice graphics\n\u2714\ufe0fThe game is even atmospheric\n\u2714\ufe0fThe sound design is really good\n\n\u2714\ufe0f\u274cThe puzzles may be too simple for some\n\n\u274cThe game is very short\n\n[i]Time of completion:  2-3 hours[/i]\n\n[b][u]Rating: 6/10[/u][/b]\n\n\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9\u06de\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cf\n\n[h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34408584/]Follow my curator for more reviews[/url][/h1]\n\u25cf\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u0b9c\u06e9\u06de\u06e9\u0b9c\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25cf\n[b]\nATTENTION!\nPlease note that this is only my evaluation and opinion of the game.

I'm always a sucker for asymmetric co-op, and [b]The Past Within[/b] shares the cool design of [b]Tick Tock: A Tale for Two[/b] in that two players can play together without actually being connected online. I played the \"Past\" side, while my co-op partner played the \"Future.\" I'm unsure what difference it ends up making, but we selected the bee instead of the butterfly at the beginning of the game.\n\nI loved the illustrated characters, the items, and the environments in the game, as well as the auditory and visual effects that occur at key shocking moments. The whole thing feels like a creepy voodoo ritual, which does seem to jive with the universe of [b]Rusty Lake[/b] from my understanding (I haven't played any other [b]Rusty Lake[/b] games). Solving this macabre puzzle box was really unlike anything I've done in a game before, and I had a lovely time doing so.\n\nAnother thing I came to appreciate more while watching the \"Let's Play\" is the way that objects and actions in the past correspond to those in the future, as certain streamers were able to bounce between the perspective of the Past and Future player. At one point, the player in the future starts playing some beat-heavy music. In response, the furniture within the room of the player in the past begins inexplicably (from your perspective) bumping and shaking around (which helps unlock a way forward).\n\nIn general, the puzzles are quite well-designed in the game. They're intuitive without being easy, and I felt a sense of satisfaction at each critical story juncture. The only type of player I wouldn't recommend this game to would be a solo gamer since it's inherently a cooperative experience. However, if you have a bud to take on the ride, you should take it.
