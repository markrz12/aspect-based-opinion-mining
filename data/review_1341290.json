Totally worth your time. We Were Here Forever is the 4th game in the series, but you can play it without ever playing previous ones (I won't recommend though if you're interested in lore). \n\nGame has asymmetric gameplay, puzzles are based on communication between you and your co-op partner as each of you has only half of the puzzle. You need to let other know what you see and can do to figure out the task and help each other to finish it. And believe me, devs tried to make puzzles as challenging as it was possible.\n\nCompared to other co-op room escape games this one focuses more on your coordination. Puzzle itself could be not that hard, but explaining to each other what you see and combine knowledge to solve the problem is a tricky part.\n\nCompared to previous games in this series puzzles become noticably harder and require more talking to explain and making sense out of hints. Game also lost a lot of replayability as more puzzles have scripted solutions instead of being randomized. Appearance of several timed puzzles which require coordinated timed input from you both also added to the level of the challenge. But everything was possible to figure out, so we greatly enjoyed this ecperience.\n\nTechnically game is also better optimized than previous ones in the series. There were no crushes this time and \"surprize\" levels where fps dropped to zero because of additional details on it.\n\nCan't wait for the next game!^.~", "timestamp_created": 1670107826, "timestamp_updated": 1670108087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716829180717468262", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139016733": {"recommendationid": "139016733", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031032020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1669912380}, "language": "english", "review": "Brief Overview at the bottom!

Especially given that Forever is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best of the series. The biggest, the most complicated and by far the most expensive of all four games, We Were Here Forever takes you on one (and probably last) adventure. But is it worth it? \nYou can bet your ass it is. There really are no obvious flaws that I could talk about. This game is simply great and you should buy it. Without hesitation, if you happen to have a friend or a loved one up for some logical puzzles. Hell, even with internet strangers this game might be one hell of an experience.\n\n[h1]In awe at the size of this lad[/h1]\nI am honestly astounded by how far this game series has come. It\u2019s mind-boggling that something that used to be a tiny free game to be completed in one sitting has become a giant, highly-polished product which gives so much content it is difficult to overstate how fun it can be.\nThe very first thing I have to note is that from previous experiences with We Were Here games, both myself and my mate Alvarion who I had a pleasure of playing all four titles with, expected this game to be short. Or at least short-ER. Short enough to complete it with one, monstrous 8h sitting. Maybe 10-12 hours if need be. Needless to say, we weren\u2019t even close. It took us well over 14 hours to complete the title for the first time. [b]And that\u2019s worth a praise.[/b] Because literally at no point was the game boring or time wasted. No, it was a blast through and throughout this many hours. It\u2019s a puzzle game with an enormous number of things to do in it. We Were Here Forever is an absolute unit. There is just a puzzle, after a puzzle, after a puzzle and it really doesn\u2019t seem to end until you really are reaching the conclusion of the story. \n\nOne thing that you might want to take away from this is\u2026 I\u2019m not saying you [i]can\u2019t[/i] complete WWHF in one sitting. There is a certain threshold after which that fragile pink mass hidden within your skull cavity starts giving up. I think we have reached our maximum brain capacities at 6 hours mark on the first day. With logic games you should really watch out for that. Cause there is a moment in which you become tired of playing, no matter how fun the title is. Keeping a high level of focus necessary to solve complex puzzles gets more and more difficult as the time goes on. Take my advice, go for short or longer breaks after each chapter to come back fresh and be the best \u201cyou\u201d you can be.\n\nHaving that in mind, the developers neatly divided the game into chapters. Each of them consists of a couple of themed puzzles. To give you a better look into the world of We Were Here, every puzzle also presents some narrative elements. Big enough for you to notice how tied to the game world each puzzle is, small enough to let you go to the bathroom without worrying of losing an important piece of storytelling. \n\nSpeaking of storytelling \u2013 the story that was first hinted in We Were Here, then shyly expanded in We Were Here Too, and then pushed to something I could call an actual piece of narrative in We Were Here Together, and is FINALLY focused on in Forever. Merely speaking of it could be too revealing so let me just tell you what I think about it.\nIt's good. It\u2019s nothing groundbreaking but it does make sense. It ties the previous games together and gives you more information about the lore behind all those events. Total Mayhem Games was not scared to put a short cinematic cutscene between each chapter and then create a great visual finale before and after the actual story climax. It was a great decision because nothing seems out of place anymore while still keeping that elusive masquerade of not telling you everything.\n\n[h1]Use your brain[/h1]\nSomething I should perhaps touch on is the game\u2019s difficulty level. [i]Well? What is it, Tank?[/i]\nI\u2019m gonna say\u2026 it\u2019s perfectly balanced. For the first time in the series.\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nThere are multiple puzzles to go through, from matching shapes, through describing sounds, playing spot the difference, planning routes, placing things in correct spaces to doing all of these things in correct order under the pressure of time. And it\u2019s fantastic. This is the first game in the series, where Alvarion and I made a list of puzzles we liked and disliked each and while our lists varied\u2026 we were never like [i]\u201cthis one thing sucked\u201d[/i]. All of the challenges were fun and engaging. Obviously to a different degree, but neither of them was downright bad. Well, maybe except the underwater labyrinth.\nAs you can imagine some things had us scratching our heads for a nice little while\u2026 but it was never because the puzzle was too convoluted to understand or because it was designed poorly. Every puzzle can be solved. We just had to figure them out first. We were actually surprised that the difficulty level does not go through a sudden spike but rather goes at a steady pace through the entire title.\nI would really hurt your experience by telling you about the puzzles themselves but there is one thing you need to know:\n\n[h1]This game is like a good psychological horror movie[/h1]\nWe Were Here Forever is best experienced [b]ONCE[/b]. And only once.\nWhen I said that every puzzle can be solved, I wasn\u2019t lying. It can be. Sadly, there is only one key to every quote unquote \u201criddle\u201d. ONLY one. Everything you go through will be EXACTLY the same on all other playthroughs, to the point where after completing the game once, when my friend and I switched roles\u2026 we could complete some of the puzzles without even communicating. Memory alone was enough to lead us straight through them.\n\nIs it a bad thing that the game can be completed only once? I don\u2019t believe it is. But that is a one step back from the previous titles. In other entries of the series the roles that you take were distinct enough from one another to keep you invested into a second playthrough. After completing WWHF once you probably will never start this game ever again. Is it\u2026 a problem though? I\u2019d say that the longer time it takes to complete the We Were Here Forever makes up for the fact that you\u2019re better off playing it only once.", "timestamp_created": 1678480153, "timestamp_updated": 1678480153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708933353424072266", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141068182": {"recommendationid": "141068182", "author": {"steamid": "76561199223679280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1688237626}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely this is the best coop adventure game that I've ever played.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688233393, "timestamp_updated": 1688233393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689390897750854492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125271896": {"recommendationid": "125271896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017886092", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1667943445}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This new We Were Here game is the best one yet !

From bugs to stuttering, to a convoluted storyline that tries a lot but does nothing.\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]The bugs[/h1]\n\nI like puzzles. [i]I also like playing them in a somewhat steady frame rate[/i]. Each time elements of the game world load in, there is this horrendous frame rate drop that turns your game into a slideshow. I am not one to complain about frame rate drops here and there but f*ck me, the game sh*t the bed so many times I might've missed half of the f*cking cutscenes.\n\nSome game elements were also f*cked. Around mid-game, for some reason, during [spoiler]the boulder pushing thing, after the thing was done,[/spoiler] I remained locked.... like actually locked, my character wouldn't do jack sh*t, I couldn't move, I couldn't look around, all I could do was get f*cked and spam the walkie-talkie. I had to restart the session. During the [spoiler]potion making thing, for the forgery, for some reason, I wouldn't get the prompt to pick up the star-square-circle things after I would craft something. At first, I thought I was just being ret*rded because I didn't have a bowl to put them in but no, it would bug out and the only fix I could find was to spam sh*t like I was weapon spamming or pick another empty bowl[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]The puzzles[/h1]\n\nWhy? Why would you put some of the most autistic puzzles during the first 3/4 of the game, just to end it with the [spoiler]Candy Crush equivalent of the Titanic[/spoiler]? When I say autistic, I don't mean neither good nor bad, I just mean.... weird. Don't get me wrong, they were good but I feel like this game became something far more complex than it should've been. From [spoiler]translating whatever a f*cking kraken looking a*s squid was saying[/spoiler] to [spoiler]piecing togheter a f*cking ray gun like it's a zombies map from Black Ops[/spoiler] it just felt weird man.... It's just not enjoyable when you tease me with the [spoiler]jester box platforming thing with teleporting doors[/spoiler] just to castrate me with the f*cking cringe a*s [spoiler]sitting of the puppets puzzle where you put 100 f*cking clues for 100 f*cking riddles, all at once, so good luck, f*cker, in figuring out who the f*ck asked[/spoiler]. Quantity over quality is all I'm saying.\n\n[h1]The story[/h1]\n\nA Brazzers show with Johnny Bravo, Johnny Sins and the newly announced Scooby Doo: The ballad of gay Velma would've been far more enjoyable than that God awful [spoiler]Titanic welcome to the Fortnite metaverse rip off[/spoiler].\n\nIt's just painful to watch a story devolve so dramatically, from intriguing to confusing to \"what the f*ck is that DiCaprio?\". The ending was so unnecessary man, atleast give us an alternative, some secret ending, something that makes sense. [spoiler]And what happened to the king? Where the f*ck did the jester go? Why can't we obey him? Why is the king such a little b*tch?[/spoiler] Why is there so much downtime? Why do I have to [spoiler]ride that f*cking platform back and forth just to get TWO CUTSCENES IN HALF A FRAME PER HOUR out of.... 6 trips?[/spoiler] Why is the [spoiler]chairlift ride so... meaningless? You make me spend so much time for a wannabe cutscene to see some fog and some mountains, just to end the game on a rushed Titanic soap opera[/spoiler].\n\nSo much potential wasted. From the [spoiler]mysterious jester[/spoiler] to the [spoiler]good king gone mad[/spoiler] to the [spoiler]plot by the \"families\"[/spoiler] just to get an ending that.. just doesn't fit.\n\n[h1]The goods?[/h1]\n\nThe game makes huge improvements on the foundation set by previous titles. Puzzles got more complex (in my opinion, this damages the game more than it does good), visuals are gorgeous, controls feel sturdy. It really pains me to give it a negative review but I had to go through a roller coaster of emotions just to be greeted by f*cking [spoiler]Leonardo f*cking DiCaprio. You're laughing but that's what it is. It's literally the f*cking scene from Titanic, except Rose is replaced by my f*cking buddy who doesn't say jack sh*t except \"farewell\" as he drowns like a f*cking c*nt and I keep saying \"nah, it can't be. It can't f*cking end like this, that's cringe\" but the game actually ends, credits roll and all you have to say is \"Jesus f*cking Christ\" because the f*cking boat that could've saved you both just keeps blasting that f*cking horn, almost mocking you for thinking the game would end well[/spoiler].\n\n[h1]The other \"We were here\" games are good though. Please make another one, this can't be the last one, it's just cringe[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1665703440, "timestamp_updated": 1665703612, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610600531101226807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141417364": {"recommendationid": "141417364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127192366", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1688611666}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game in the series and easily my favorite co-op puzzle game.

It all depends on the players and how good they are at puzzles.\nThe game is about communicating. Each player gets a walkie in the beginning to be able and speak with the other player. As all walkies work, only one person can speak at a time and the player has to hold down the button to speak.\n\nThe two players has to make their way through a ton of obstacles, made of puzzles. Each player will have their own walkway, so to say. And will have the answer for the other player in a clue of an icon, or simply a lever that will open a gate or door for the other player.\nAt some points, the players will be able to work together at the same place but most of the time they will be split up. For certain tasks it requires both players to help in either: moving a bookshelf or pulling a lever.\n\n[h1]The Game of The Play[/h1]\nAs the game starts, both the players will wake up in some mushroom prison. They will find walkies laying in their cell and discover that the cell doors are unlocked. The players will see that they weren\u2019t in the same room as their cells were in and has to start looking for which door that\u2019s unlocked.\nAfter finding their way to a tunnel, they will walk upon their first puzzle in the game. Where one player has to tell the other some symbols that they see on a wall behind some metal bars, as the other player just has to pull a lever to open the first players door.\n\nWhen reaching the point of where the players are able to obtain the torch they will shortly after stumble upon some metal bars that keeps them apart but atleast lets the players meet.\nThe players will then find two levers for each players that they have to pull down together to open a spiked door that will lead them to an abandoned mine but also used to be a home. Who\u2019s? we don\u2019t know, but we do know that this brings more puzzles.\nOnce again the two players will be split apart and can use a basket to travel items or keys over to the other to be able and unlock some objects to get new items or unlock more of the area to get deeper into the puzzle.\nAt times both players has to be on the same side or even switch side depending on if one is overthinking about the puzzle and unable to look at it from another perspective from their side. So his companion has to take over and see if he can explain or understand the puzzle themselves.\n\nEach chapter has a completely different puzzle, so its never the same and won\u2019t get boring that easily over time while playing. Though the mind can get fried from all the puzzles.\nIn fact each chapter has its own worlds or places with total new puzzles and new areas for both players.\nThe game has it set so there is a player 1 and player 2, the choosing of who\u2019s who can be made in the main menu before starting the game.\nDepending if your player 1 or player 2, only gives you different tasks and achievements after completing different puzzles.\nEach player will see their own area when split up. So they will have to try and find a common ground/object or puzzle in their area that might give any clues or ability to unlock further into the game.\n\nThe areas or biomes that the players will see under their journey are underground mines, Some kind of torture games, the ruins of rockbury castle and town, the rockbury church, Underwater laboratory, the riddle\u2019s play box and much more under the journey. There is big and small areas with different amounts of detailing, and every place you visit will be a new view for the eyes and mind.\n\n[b]Spoiler[/b]\n[spoiler]For the last game sequel of the series they had to give it a sad end. After the players destroys the castle, the church demolishes to bits. Making them fall down into the sea beneath.\nBoth players will swim towards a light that\u2019s hanging from a wooden pole on a small raft that sadly only can fit one player.\nThe players can choose from either saving their friend and sacrificing themselves or getting saved by their friend but loosing them aswell. One man keeps his life as the other sinks to the freezing bottom of the sea, when out of nowhere a cargo ship arrives to the rescue.\nOnly one player survives, but at what cost...[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]Visual & Audio[/h1]\n[b]Visuals[/b]\n\n[u]Game Textures and lights[/u]\nThe visuals and surrounding in the game are quite beautiful and are very well done. The ground and objects doesn\u2019t collide into one and other and the small detailing in every little corner. It\u2019s just a good-looking game that also makes it more fun to play.\nAt the beginning of the game, the shading in the tunnels/corridors had bright spots in the corners up by the roof.\nWhere it should be darker it\u2019s just some brighter small light. As if it is cracks in the stones with some kind of light coming from inside of nowhere.\n\nThe texture quality of the game makes no disappointments, anywhere you look you will see how beautiful the game really is. The smooth combinations and perfect size and color fit for the objects around on the worlds. Adding the small details to the game just gives it a little extra without the player thinking about it, they just feel it and see it while exploring the world and solving the puzzles.\n\n[u]Game Animations[/u]\nAlong through the chapters I saw the animation for everything around and for the actions we did. Pulling levers, going with rides, breaking stuff. It all went so smooth and no problem in sight with anything.\nThe cutscenes runs fantastically and the moving animation of objects and players, like bridges or mechanisms and the puppeteer/the Riddler.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\n[u]Background Music[/u]\nThe music for the game doesn\u2019t get boring. It changes along with the progress that happens in the game and depending on situation, the music will change.\n\n[u]Voice actors[/u]\nThe voice acting in the game is quite stunning, The passion and emotion putted into the characters. Beside the Castle/King\u2019s voice actor, his voice sounds deeper but its missing the power and emotion in it. Its like he\u2019s just saying the words with a deeper voice and not speaking the words, expressing them.\n\n[u]Sound effects[/u]\nThe sound effects in the game have been specially made for each object, for example: The crackling old wood or heavy stone grinding against the same material as the object moves, falls, or grinds against something else. With the echo to make it sound like the sound travels through the area like real life and muffles the further your away from it.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\u2022\tAlways different puzzles.\n\u2022\tInteresting story and lore.\n\u2022\tSmooth object animations.\n\u2022\tA lot of creativity.\n\u2022\tLonger gameplay with more content.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\u2022\tThe in-game communication with the walkies isn\u2019t that comfortable or different then just simply using, for example: Discord.\n\u2022\tSometimes the torch doesn\u2019t want to respond to the \u201cR\u201d button, short time after it works.\n\n[h1]My final little thoughts[/h1]\nThe game is a lot longer with more content and puzzles then the earlier games in the series. And I was having a blast while playing it. The game is a Co-op only but luckily I had my friend Hulp to the rescue for he had the game already.\nWe tried out the walkies in the beginning, but they didn\u2019t do anything specific or given any extra spark to it, so we just communicated through a discord call.\nI highly recommend this game but only if you do have a partner, companion, friend, or person to play with.\n\nRating: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1680858275, "timestamp_updated": 1682435424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594200253486633301", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127767885": {"recommendationid": "127767885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026711023", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1670091807}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally best series of co-op games.\nTop puzzles, gameplay, visuals, atmosphere, lore, story.\n\nWe were here and we will be waiting for the next chapter c:\nThank you for this experience.", "timestamp_created": 1669993568, "timestamp_updated": 1669993568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592549443244934082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137796490": {"recommendationid": "137796490", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960812852", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1683232058}, "language": "english", "review": "This one was way harder than the ones before it, at times pretty frustrating, but I still liked it.", "timestamp_created": 1683232148, "timestamp_updated": 1683232148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589871048927307129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145615897": {"recommendationid": "145615897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278853946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 779, "last_played": 1693771073}, "language": "english", "review": "best puzzle coop game ever, nice and epic story elements, really cool and diverse puzzles, really fun - I can only recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1693771681, "timestamp_updated": 1693771681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585389912128448486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143685211": {"recommendationid": "143685211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138236960", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 697, "last_played": 1691537594}, "language": "english", "review": "best puzzle coop ive ever played\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691537747, "timestamp_updated": 1691537747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581976115703582764", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125170047": {"recommendationid": "125170047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004111343", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1667939491}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best (if not the best) co-op games I've ever played.

One person has the role of being responsible for instructing the other person who typically has the more interactive role in solving a puzzle. These roles change/are random, so one person won't be stuck doing all the work in one playthrough. There are six different chapters, each of which has multiple subchapters, that must be solved this way, using clues that are in each area.\n\nOverall, I found this game quite fun. It's a little unclear what you're supposed to do when you first start, but you can generally figure it out by clicking around and communicating what you're seeing to your teammate. The game glitched three separate times throughout my entire time playing it, including once in the first 15 minutes, which can add to the confusion/feeling like you're stuck (because you literally are lol). The Memento, The Illusions, and The Assembly were the best subchapters, in my opinion. \n\nThis game is the fourth in the We Were Here series. One playthrough took ~13.5 hours and a second playthrough for achievements (switching positions) took ~2 hours. If a co-op puzzle game sounds like something you'd enjoy, I'd recommend this game, though I definitely recommend playing the original as it is free and will give you a good sense of the type of gameplay you'll be getting into.

Another gripe I have was the gravestones puzzle.

One thing to note is that few if any of the puzzles are explained in any way, which means that you may have to figure out [i]how[/i] to even [i]do[/i] the puzzles - I don't mean how to solve the puzzle once you understand the mechanics, I mean understanding the mechanics in the first place - What to click, what's important etc.\nSome of the achievements are dependant on which \"side\" of the puzzle you do, so you might get some more replay value of playing both sides\n\nOne thing I didn't like was the use of a voice server as opposed to peer-to-peer voice. It's understandable that the developers have chosen this path considering possible hassle or issues with port-forwarding and such, but I'd much prefer at least having the [i]option[/i] to [b]NOT[/b] sign the EULA for the voice service. It states that \"if you choose to use voice communications\" or something to that effect, which is ridiculous as it's built in, a core part of the game [i]and[/i] there's no option to disable it. If you're very privacy-minded, you might want to simply use discord or steam voice instead and use windows 10 settings to not allow the game access to your mic.\n\nWith that being said, very much a great puzzle game, gave me and my buddy about 10-12 hours of enjoyment, confusion, a-ha (and sometimes \"ah man I'm an idiot\") moments.

The storytelling has been improved with cinematics. While there is an overarching story, this game works as a standalone because the focus on the story is about setting the mood for the next puzzle. The puzzles are less abstract, more intuitive and there are more of them. This doesn't mean they became easy, there will still be plenty of moments where you are stuck trying to figure out a puzzle, but they won't be as frustrating to solve. As usual, the puzzles work by exchanging information with each other and figuring them out with logic, some of which reset after a few attempts or by the timer running out.\n\nThe game currently has some issues that should be easily fixed. At the end of the octopus puzzle, I was still stuck in the chair while my partner could progress to the next puzzle. Loading up the save for the next puzzle gave a black screen to whoever was hosting. Luckily we could work around this by replaying the octopus puzzle because of the nice chapter select. In some of the bigger puzzles, the FPS takes a big hit, not just on my mediocre PC, but on my partner's beefy PC as well.\n\nOverall, this is a fun time, it's more and better!\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nPlay the game from both sides and reach both endings, has a chapter select.

And one of my favourites.\nThe previous games established much of the basic premise and puzzle structures, but were clearly still unrefined and had a lot of things that detracted from the nicer aspects. But We Were Here Forever fixes all of those detractors and more.\n\nThis review will not contain spoilers, but if you want a TL'DR; the game is superb and an example of co-operative puzzle games and instantly one of my favorite puzzle games period.\nRegardless, time to get into the nitty gritty.\n\n---- Visual & Audio ----\n\nPut simply, I love the design of this world. The art style and level design are not only incredibly beautiful, but incredibly fitting thematically. The world feels simultaneously magical like straight out of a fairytale, but also still makes total sense to navigate and explore. The detail in designs is fantastic and the variety of areas and environments is diverse and at times breathtaking. Visually the game is a master class of using effective design decisions to showcase the story and the world as you navigate it.\n\nLevels are unique and feel refreshing to look at, while the puzzles are integrated organically into the surrounding world. With lighting and use of props the world highlights what it needs to to make navigating intuitive, and also does an effective job of conveying emotion and tension.\n\nThe sound design is clear and beautiful. The music of the game is gorgeous, and the voice acting of the characters has no right being as good as it is for a puzzle game. The Jester's voice actor in particular brought their absolute best, and I was continually impressed by their performance in various parts of the game.\nIf it were up to me, they'd get an award.\n\nThe use of cutscenes and animations, while subdued and not excessive, is very effective. And the visual and audio design of those cutscenes is fantastic and truly left an impression on me.\nAll of this combines into a style that I truly think will stand the test of time and will still inspire joy in people years from now. And all the kudos to the artists and sound designers, as well as the voice cast.\n\n---- Puzzles ----\n\nThe puzzles are plentiful, and yet incredibly unique. The puzzles didn't repeat themselves past their welcome, and were always intuitively designed to fit into the environment and to be easily approachable and understandable. As well as requiring you to move around whilst doing so, making it feel more kinetic and memorable than simply staring at a piece of paper or a machine. Offering a nice variety of both difficulty and type of puzzle means that you're not likely to get bored at lack of new things to try or puzzles to figure out. So if you want to be truly tested on various kinds of puzzles, this is the game for you without a doubt.\n\nThe communication between co-op partners is intuitive and encourages you to learn to communicate more effectively. The puzzles are designed in a way where you can describe the situation very well once you wrap your head around it, and all it often takes is for your partner to say one thing to set the light bulbs off in your head. In addition to this many levels involve changing around the perspective between you and your partner, as well as converging your paths only to separate them again.\nThis all makes for a far more organic feeling and free environment, making it feel less constrained and boxed in than previous We Were Here titles, or many other puzzle games.\n\nCommunication in-game is done through a simple but effective voice chat system incorporating a walkie talkie. (Though granted I played it with a friend over Discord, but it's nice to have for those that don't have that option or want the extra immersion.) Communication is key, and this is a good way to practice how well you and a friend can sync up and learn to convey information.\n\nThe puzzles never got on my nerves, though you might of course be different in this regard, but I was simply enjoying my time far too much. And overall the puzzles are fantastic and deal with so many unique concepts and gameplay methods that I can't help but applaud the developers.\n\n---- Gameplay ----\n\nPlaying the game is incredibly intuitive, navigating is easy and straightforward and the game does a fantastic job of introducing the environments and puzzles to you. The tutorial the game begins with is very effective at conveying all the basic skills you'll need to get started, and once the game proper begins it's a steady curve of improvement and challenge from one location to the next.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and functions as expected with the exception of a few slight bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking as far as I or my friend experienced. The controls are responsive and the way you interact with the environment or the puzzles are all simple to grasp on a technical level. The levels are designed in a way to make them quite easy to wrap your head around and figure out where everything is, with clever uses of memorable landmarks as well as good use of lines of sight.\n\nThis also extends to your partner, and locating each other is usually not too difficult. And if you have trouble figuring out where you are, just describe what you see and turn on your torch and finding each other is quick and easy. The co-op aspect of gameplay works without issues and I encountered no problems that prevented us from progressing during the entire duration of the game. Connection seems a non-issue (though that's to be expected) with the only slight desync happening for some animations.\n\nOverall the game is very accessible even if you're fairly new to first person games, and wrapping your head around the ordeal won't take too long to figure out.\n\n---- Technicals ----\n\nThe game runs flawlessly, with one notable exception. Transitions from level to level often cause lag and choppiness for some amount of time as the levels load in. However, it subsides quickly and once the game has finished loading everything in, all problems are gone. Performance is rock solid beyond these load moments, and I had no issues playing the game what-so-ever.\n\nThe controls are responsive and the menus are a vast improvement over previous titles in the series, and the UI is well designed and clean allowing you to take everything in properly.\nA lot of people kept referring to a bugged puzzle in the graveyard section of the game, but we encountered no bug in said area. Not sure if we simply got lucky, or if there's something else going on. But overall there was no real hindrance at any point to our playthrough or enjoyment, and overall the experience was pretty flawless.\n\n---- Closing thoughts ----\n\nUltimately it comes down to one simple fact. Do you like puzzles?\nIf you do, then this game is undoubtedly worth checking out, and a great way to spend some quality time with a friend. However it is worth noting that as a co-op only puzzle game.\nI would recommend either bringing along a friend, or finding suitable players on the community page or through other means. Since it definitely is a commitment, albeit a fairly small one.\n\nOverall We Were Here Forever is one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. Up there with games like Portal or Talos Principle. A unique and refreshing experience with beautiful designs throughout, a fantastic style, absolutely stellar voice acting and audio, and some of the most breathtaking and varied environments.\n\nThe developers have refined their talent, and have put out a game that truly is one of the best of its kind.\nAnd the amount of love and effort put into every corner of the game is undeniable.\n\nThe name of the game is incorrect, since we were only there for a couple evenings. But the game certainly makes a compelling case for why I would want to be there forever. Since it was truly a wonderful experience made with care and love.\n\nAnd I'd be lying if I said I didn't want much, much more of it.", "timestamp_created": 1652644474, "timestamp_updated": 1669201815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758128225803375244", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116562891": {"recommendationid": "116562891", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964110269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1654495963}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely loved 85% of the game.

It\u2019s a game where you truly cooperate, not just play together with your friend and do your own thing.

All puzzles are different from each other so it never feels repetitive. This is also amazing because even though it\u2019s already their fourth We Were Here game, they can still come up with new fresh ideas for great puzzles.\n\nThis is not a game you want to watch before playing. For the best experience I recommend going in knowing nothing about the puzzles and solutions. I also recommend starting with their first game We Were Here, which is for free and is very short. This way you will know if you like this kind of gameplay and then you can decide if you want to buy the rest or not. \n\nThere might still be bugs in the game.

You are rarely in the same room, and get glimpses of lore as you explore atmospheric castle set pieces.\n\n[b] If you've played the previous games: [/b] \nYou get exactly what you'd expect here. Forever is more of the same, but not in a stale way. Some puzzle styles will feel familiar, while others bring fun and fresh ideas to the table. It's a great mix.\n\nA lot of the time, you will be visiting unique looking areas that are in strong contrast to the drab bricked dungeons we're used to in the series. And we get a lot more story and cutscenes in this game, for those itching to learn more about the world. It's done well, and doesn't feel like it gets in the way of pacing.\n\nThe graphics are charming, and the music always enhances the mood. I got sucked into the environment, and got spooked or fascinated many times.\n\nFor the most part, the puzzles are pretty tough, but you will figure them out with perseverance. However, like in past games, there are a few puzzles that really had us scratching our heads for a long time. The game can get quite tough at times, with some time-sensitive puzzles, or others that have you juggle a ton of information in your head at once.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nIn the end, if you enjoyed the series up to this point, I think you will have fun with this game too. I think the games have been growing in terms of quality and length with every new installment. And if you haven't played the series yet, and enjoy asymmetrical co-op games, (and don't mind possibly losing your friends over puzzle misunderstandings), then give the series a try!\n\n[code] Follow my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/5265312/]Steam Curator Page[/url] for more reviews of my favourite AAA and Indies!

Suddenly you're freed from your cells and this begins your journey to escape, but you find that the stakes are much higher than ever before.\n\nEven though there's much more story this time around, it again takes a backseat to the puzzles and such. However this time around a lot of the puzzles have lore written into the puzzles, so while you're solving the complex enigmas thrown at you, it tells you the story of the castle and what led to it's downfall. However a good chunk of it is information that we learned from the previous games, although with added explanations. \n\nThe only major negative is that the story ends on a very sequel bait ending which feels incredibly abrupt considering the journey to the end is much longer this time around. The fact that we're likely pretty far away from the next entry, I feel like they should have went with something else.  \n\nGraphics\n\nFrom game to game the graphical leap has been impressive to say the least. What started as a simplistic looking game has now turned into a really visually stunning game. The environments you visit throughout are grander in scale and in visual fidelity.\n\nSome of the moments you witness are actually jaw dropping and the developers have totally outdid themselves. Of course there are still a few minor issues like some textures being re-used from the previous game and some of the models looking low quality, but they are so minor they do not detract from everything else.\n\nAudio:\n\nOut of a game full of strengths this is probably it's biggest weakness. First of all let's start with the music. The music throughout the series has always been pretty weak for me and I'm glad to say that this one has the best soundtrack hands down. There's plenty of great new tracks that help build atmosphere, get your blood pumping etc. \n\nHowever I've noticed that quite a lot of the games sound effects and even some minor tracks have been re-used from the previous games. Again since the development team is so small, I feel like I can excuse this, but I wish that they wouldn't rely on re-used assets as much as they do. Also the tradition of so bad it's good voice acting is still here front and center.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWe Were Here Forever follows the same basic formula as the previous three games in the series. You and your co-op partner have walkie talkies and use them to communicate to solve increasingly difficult puzzles. So let's talk about the puzzles. \n\nThe puzzles start off simple enough, but quickly become incredibly complex. The scope of the game is much larger in scale and because of it, the puzzles seem scarier before you comprehend everything that goes into solving it. That's not to say that they are simple, they range from simplistic, to pretty difficult. \n\nThere's not many puzzles this time around that can cause death, but they are traded with more puzzles that take longer to complete cause they force you to walk around a large area, flipping different mechanisms. For some these puzzles might seem much more tedious than what was in the other games, purely due to the size of them, but I felt like that was one of this games strength. \n\nMy biggest gripe with the puzzles is the a poor difficulty scale. It felt like each puzzle in the previous games gradually got harder and harder with some minor breathing room puzzles, Forever has puzzles that are incredibly difficult, followed up by incredibly easy puzzles and vice versa, however since basically all of them are incredibly fun to solve. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThe fourth entry in the series is by far the most complex and fun. Every game has been a vast improvement over the previous and if there is a number 5 I can't wait to see what crazy puzzles will the devs come up with next. If you want to play something with a friend and have nothing to do, you can't go wrong with these games, so go and check it out.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9/10\n\nPros:\n+ Puzzles are the best yet\n+ Visuals are stunning \n+ Interesting lore \n\nCons:\n- Difficulty scaling is all over the place \n- Ending is sequel bait\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews", "timestamp_created": 1664408049, "timestamp_updated": 1664408049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652301490306854248", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115385390": {"recommendationid": "115385390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063840228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1667178032}, "language": "english", "review": "Not even 4 hours into the game and it is one of, if not the best game I\u2019ve ever played.

We were so pumped to get this game the second it came out, and how could we resist that juicy 10% off sale?\n\nNow the game, I will not lie has been a buggy mess, and it was especially worse when there was no Australian servers for the first few days. However the devs were really onto it and fixed everything as soon as they could, I know my partner wasn't taking any of the shit the first few days but then we both realised something in our hearts. We are the smartest, and the funniest, and the best, and the only ones who should be together in such desperate measures.\n\nThe best part about smashing out a game so early is that there is no walkthrough, meaning that everything we did was legitty on our titties, which leads me to believe that our brain patterns have been altered, what if we are both genetically engineered to begin with?\n\nI remember playing the first game several times and not knowing about how deep the lore actually went, but when my partner came along for the first time, the one I was destined to be with, I just knew that the one I had been waiting for had finally come, and I opened my eyes for the first time to see how good the lore actually is. As I write this review, I know my partner wants more of this, whether its part of the same series or not, as long as we keep getting more.\n\nI have a bad feeling however that this is the last game of the We Were Here series, they say that all good things must come to an end, however I do know one thing is for sure. This door closes for me, but it has made way for another one to open, the path that I must walk with my partner. And I know that I definitely won't be treading off this path, no matter how long it is I will always stand by my partners side, this series has prepared us for the toughest obstacles that we can now face on our own.\n\nI was asked several times by a few of my friends, \"Who is this mysterious partner you keep referring to? And why are they so perfect?\" Perhaps one day I may reveal this partner, however all I can say for now, is that my partner was a very unlikely one, and that I would have never foreseen being with them like this.\n\nJust the thought of me and my partner having been through so much together, seeing each other leave one behind, as one of us turns our backs and keeps walking, getting separated and coming back to each other. I do know that if I was ever met with a choice similar to the series in the real world, I know what I would pick. But I would not think of them as the \"Worst Friend Forever\". After all, I was always first to get left behind or die each time, and I don't plan on changing the outcome.\n\nAll that matters to me is my partners happiness, but how can I make someone happy when they are faced with such a difficult choice? If the time ever comes, I hope that my partner will understand what I have done, and that everything I did was to make this special someone happy. I do know that our ups heavily outweigh our downs, and that is enough for me. I sleep easy at night knowing that the choices I have made for my partner will keep a smile on their face.\n\nTo think that in the little time I had with my partner, it feels like we have known each other for years, decades, centuries, hell even eons. There will always be a place in my heart for my partner, whether we drift apart in the future, or if we end up staying together. I know damn well that I prefer the latter of that sentence, but I will keep this up as a memory, so that I may never forget the amazing times I had with my partner.

Instead, the developers have stuck to what they know: building unique and interesting puzzles that demand a kind of teamwork very rarely seen in other games. The game improves on its predecessors in every way, without losing the magic that made the series unique in the first place.

Some of them required a decent amount of thinking while others you needed good team coordination/communication. There was one puzzle that we thought was troublesome. Maybe we're just stupid but we thought the clues provided weren't very clear. Also it was the first time we used the \"Hint\" feature in the game and they were literally the most useless things ever. One of them was \"try to use deduction if you don't know where to place these\". Yeah thanks for telling me a basic human problem solving skill. \nPersonally I found some of the puzzles kind of boring. It just felt for a few of them that 1 person didn't have much to do.\n\nThe story was decent. Just the same stuff that's been going on the past few games. It does go more into depth of what's happening but I didn't care much for it.\n\nThe biggest problem in the game for us was all the waiting. They make you ride on like a snow lift multiple times that takes a solid like 20-30 seconds for no reason except the 1 time there was a cut scene. There are other instances too where it just takes too long for the game to take you through a pointless ride.\n\nThe graphics were great and a step up from the previous game.

No, it's much better! It's a fantastic puzzle-focused coop game and we need more. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d [u]The good parts:[/u]\n+Level design and the environments.\n+The puzzles ofc.\n+Much better story-telling than previous ones.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e[u]The bad parts:[/u]\n-Minor bugs that made us restart an entire chapter.\n-Some puzzles like the final one were super easy. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIf you played the previous ones, you know there's some story about a king and how he did some bad things and some jester but it never made much sense. Luckily the story finally becomes much more focused and clear as there are finally story cutscenes with dialogue and everything. \n\nYou are back at Castle Rock trying to go through the Jester and King's endless puzzles but this time something changes. You manage to escape and find yourselves outside the castle where you find the plans of some rebel families that stood up to the King. I won't spoil more but this time around it feels like there's some actual lore behind everything as well as a proper ending, well except for one minor thing which I did not like at the end. Don't think there was an alternative to it. \n\nIn any case, this is not some story that will blow your mind or make you emotional, the series was never about that, but I appreciated that they did gave us something better than previous games in this regard. \n\nStory rating: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nJust like the previous games, We Were Here Forever is a coop puzzle-focused adventure game where you and your partner have to progress through really tough puzzles in order to escape Castle Rock and its vicinities. \n\nYou'll have parts where you can switch back and forth puzzles with your partner which helps in figuring out certain puzzles but there are also parts where you are both stuck on your selected side and you'll have to coordinate via voice on how to advance forward. \n\nMost puzzles will require you both to really think hard but there are a few such as the final one where they are extremely easy. The last puzzle was a bit disappointing, I was expecting something much more with an ompfh. Overall as I don't want to spoil you with what the game will throw at you in terms of puzzles, there are going to be some path-blocking ones, there's a cooking simulator one, and so many more. They are all unique and different from each other, not once will you get bored. There's also a hint system tho it's mostly useless as it only tells you how to start figuring out the puzzles which anyone with an average IQ will do.  \n\nFun and tough game and I'm curious what the devs can cook up next, assuming they'll still do coop/puzzle games. It's a rare genre so more is always welcome. Perhaps something sci-fi next time such as Portal 2 coop? \n\nGameplay rating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nAh, voice acting, finally you won't have to look at weird cutscenes without a voice and surprisingly it's really well acted. \n\nThe soundtrack is great, no complaints here, and I loved that there was a music type of puzzle as well as one with figuring out words out of sounds. Really well done. \n\nOther than that, the sound effects such as the atmospheric ones and whatever else are generally quite good, no complaints.\n\nAudio rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nI'll start with the bad real quick which were some bugs that forced us to restart an entire chapter but the devs said it had to do with servers so who knows. There were other minor ones as well but nothing worth talking about. \n\nWhat's really impressive this time around is the scope of the levels and their design.

I don't know why that is necessary. Because it shouldn't be.\n* The game has an account system - god knows why, but at least it's optional.\n* Performance is certain parts, most notably the underwater part is quite bad\n* Some of the puzzles require one of the players to do majority of the thinking while the other player got not  much to do, which kinda is a problem\n* We had some connection issues mid game, where my friend simply could not connect to their proprietary servers. It would appear the game does not support Steam P2P and requires some bullshit online servers. What happens when the developer decides to shut them down?\n* The potion puzzle having a time limit is anti fun.\n* There are some inconsistencies in quality. Some loading screens are \"live\" where the game still has things happening, but most of the time it's a black screen. Another one that jumps out is the Rockbury cart ride, where certain things are clearly not animated when they should be. Certain interactions are not animated in 3rd person such as pushing revolving lever things.

I won't call it bad - you've got your two player puzzling and it works - but for the final(?) game in the series, the one with the longest development time and the one with the highest price tag, it feels a big step backwards from its predecessors.\n\nIt's hard to nail down exactly why, but I think it feels too tame, as if they approached this one with the mindset of really making a commercial game (the original was a student project IIRC), and were worried of scaring away players. There's no tension of having to solve a puzzle before you die to some encroaching hazard (increasingly-panicked chatter on the walkie talkies that can't both receive and transmit at the same time was genuinely one of my favourite parts of the previous games), and the puzzles are so self-contained - no more running around trying to figure out what you should be doing, instead you're typically sealed in a small area with only the puzzle elements, leaving the experience feeling overly-curated. \"Here's the next puzzle, solve it using these parts,\" goes the game, \"I'll be waiting to escort you to the next puzzle.\"\n\nOn top of that, the puzzles themselves feel worse than in the previous games. Too many of the puzzles have both players simultaneously interacting with the same elements, leading to most of them ending with one person figuring it out and dictating everything to the other player. They feel more like single-player puzzles where the second player only exists to physically enter their half of the solution and maybe answer specific questions about details you know are there but can't see the exact details of.\nThe few asymmetrical puzzles beyond that seem to blitz through the interesting asymmetrical puzzle solving and go straight to the execution. Rather than collaboratively working out a solution you tend to see what you're supposed to do straight away followed by however much time of just repeating information back and forth, or worse one player is left really bored as their half just has so much less to do.\nReally, the asymmetrical part of the co-op puzzle solving was what made the series unique, and to see it stray away from that feels like they've squandered what made the games what they are.\n\nThe game's longer than the older ones. There's more story as well, which may be hit-or-miss. I couldn't care less for it as it was the series's mechanics that held my interest, but the friend I played through them with was interested in the story. Either way, the individual puzzle quality has suffered for both. There were a couple I came out of thinking 'that one was pretty decent', but there's nothing memorable in there.\n\nAs I said at the start, I can't outright call it bad, but the development time and the price point both set expectations that the game consistently failed to meet.

It's not the first rodeo for Total Mayhem Games, and boy, does it show.\n\nPicture this: a co-op puzzler where you and your partner are thrown into a labyrinth of tricky enigmas. Sometimes you're side by side, pulling levers and deciphering codes, while at other times, you're scattered, sharing crucial information over trusty walkie-talkies. Oh, did I mention there's a sinister jester lingering in the background? It adds a touch of mystery, but let's be real, the puzzles are the stars here.\n\nNow, the story takes a bit of a backseat, and that's perfectly fine. We're not here for a cinematic masterpiece; we're here to flex those brain muscles. The narrative carries on from the previous games, which is a nice touch for returning players. Still, for me, it wasn't exactly a gripping novel\u2014more like a side note to the real action.\n\nBut let's cut to the chase\u2014the puzzles. We Were Here Forever doesn't just bring puzzles; it brings a masterclass in intricate design. From memory challenges to quick reactions, and logical thinking, each puzzle throws a different flavor at you, always rewarding when cracked. And communication? More critical than ever. There were moments my partner and I felt utterly stumped, only to realize we missed a tiny detail. It's a testament to how every detail matters, and talking your way through is the key to success.\n\nNow, not all puzzles were sunshine and rainbows. Some were needlessly tricky or dragged on a tad too long. One involved hitting colored switches, and trust me, it sounded way better on paper. But let's not dwell on the hiccups because, trust me, the good far outweighs the bad.\n\nThis game is a beefy adventure, clocking over ten hours easily. The longer runtime meant a few puzzles got under my skin, but it also meant there were plenty more that I absolutely loved. And the world, my friend, it's more extensive than ever. Castle Rock has evolved, offering diverse areas that pop visually. Even though some places felt a bit similar, the breathtaking sights kept me hooked.\n\nNow, it's tricky to spill all the beans without spoilers, but here's the gist: We Were Here Forever is a concoction of ingenious puzzles and seamless co-op communication. It's Total Mayhem Games flexing their muscles, and boy, does it pay off. The co-op puzzling concept, you'd think it'd get stale by the fourth entry. Surprise, surprise\u2014it's better than ever.\n\nSo, among a couple of annoying puzzles and a bit of a stretch in certain areas, We Were Here Forever stands tall, offering a gripping co-op puzzle experience. If you're into brain-teasers and fancy a unique multiplayer ride, give it a shot. \n\nWhen you finally nail that puzzle with your partner? It's Pure satisfaction.", "timestamp_created": 1703493090, "timestamp_updated": 1703493105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624657511711120605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157209011": {"recommendationid": "157209011", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121161136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 658, "last_played": 1703356328}, "language": "english", "review": "jo", "timestamp_created": 1706642250, "timestamp_updated": 1706642250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618296504020690918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148425415": {"recommendationid": "148425415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004613995", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1699242229}, "language": "english", "review": "This series is fantastic.

Thus: I suggest you play the other 3 games before this one!\nThey try to hint and/or even bring back some puzzles from the other 3 games, but with changes of course so it isn't exactly the same at all. But for me, this was a really nice little 'easter eggs' and just nice reference and connection to their other games.\n\nBUT! Not just for that: There is a story~! The first game didn't have it much at first to me but one hint, but by game two, and really 3, you start to learn of a developing story that I thought fit very will for the game's atmosphere. And this game, 'Forever', brings the story to a conclusions- or does it~?- and more explainational depth.\n\n\nOverall: The story I thought was really well done, and yet will still leave you questioning a few things but I think is intentional. Either for a future game, or just to make you wonder forever (just as the title hah). The actual 'gameplay' mechanics I think honestly degraded, *just slightly* though. I felt they could of just stuck with game 3's keybindings and all, but nothing was annoying or confusing to say the least. We still played with no problems. Graphics: Just better of course following the other games showing their progress. And the Puzzles. . ho boy.\n\nPuzzles: I will say, started off great and wracks your brain to think with your partner- although me and my partner were rather too smart and flew through pretty fast but still enough to satisfy thinking hard enough :3. But.. the later half or near endgame, I will say became VERY confusing. Two puzzles had me and partner confused and lost on where to even start. We're pretty sure one puzzle we just 'accidentally' completed, as we never really figured out what the puzzle was. But overall 80% of the puzzles were clear on what you needed to figure out after some thinking, and was really fun and unique each time :3.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics nice\n+ Puzzles you really will need to think and have patience on.\n+ Awesome, unique story!\n+ Lengthy enough to feel engaging and not too short at all.\n\nCon:\n- Two puzzles really give you no idea where or how to start and what to do.\n- Half the puzzles are pretty one sided on working together to help, but + they do balance back and forth on this position for each player.\n- Sadly may not be replayable even with new partner as you'll already understand the puzzles after.\n\n\n* This series was fun :3 and would love to play it again, but the puzzles are not randomized T^T. Even if I returned years later, I'm sure i'll at least remember what to do, even if not how to solve it instantly.

Hazelight for example. \n\nThe game offers a bunch of fun and challenging puzzles and every step you make in this game feals earned. This time we get to experience different sets from castle to underwater a lot of stuff to freshen up the gameplay is included. It even has boss fights. Really for the first time you have boss fights and they are great. \n\nWith We Were Here Forever we finally got see the outcome of a great narration giving us a satisfying end to a great series. The built up, the expection I had where filled to the brim and the game as all games plays with your emotions. \n\nPuzzlewise games like the big dimensional puzzle or the side scrolling one where a great expierence to make. It might be that the second game is my favorite but this is surely a good competitor for that spot. The only let down I experience is the overwhelming input some rooms and puzzles have. Were the first two games where easilier to grasp the third and this sometimes needed time understand and getting used to some rooms and puzzles. \n\nI did wrote some line about the lessons this game series tells. A lesson about bonding further with a friend or partner. The grand finale combines the best of all lessons. While the first focused on communication, the second strengthen collaboration and trust and the third tested your patience, the final one does everything to break you and your partners bonding. The result if withstanded is a deeper and stronger bond. \n\nSometimes I wished I could rediscover those games as if I never played them before and then playing them for the first time again. Its so great to take each new person in my life to get to know them with playing the great We Were Here Series. \n\nI am so gratefull for those games and I hope total Mayhem can bring us more great games.

The Story is a direct continuation of we were here together. Every puzzle is satisfying to complete and involves a lot of simultaneous puzzle-solving compared to just call and response puzzle solving. (Even though a good portion are call and response, it still requires at least some work on the other person's end to complete). The story is great in this game and really tells a story through puzzles as well as just having great puzzles. This game is home to my absolute favorite puzzles in the series. They have a hint system which is 90% of the time useless. They give you 3 hints per level (per person). and you can only open them 30 seconds after one another so you really think about it. But the hints are usually just \"1. communicate with your partner\" \"2. look around for hints!\" and then the third hint usually had substance. I only used hints on a few levels. It doesnt rely on hard-to-describe symbols as its only sense of difficulty and it is just a blast to play. If you want to get the complete we were here experience definitely play Forever as it avoids most of the pitfalls of the other games.\n\nYou should play we were here Together before to get the story, but before that you can play The first game and Friendship if you just wanna feel out the games without a huge time/money commitment\nNot to mention that we were here forever has about 5 hours worth of playtime more than together", "timestamp_created": 1708290904, "timestamp_updated": 1708290904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "155582050": {"recommendationid": "155582050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015996803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 902, "last_played": 1704749518}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game of them all.

While a little clunky my computer can usually handle most intense games with not much issue, but no matter how low I make the settings this game is just a mess. Thankfully it never really interfered with any of the puzzles, but if you have a lower end computer I would be wary. \n\nOptimization aside, We Were Here Forever is another amazing entry to this series. The location and grandeur of the story have increased tenfold, giving the Explorers more varied and interesting places to explore. Similar to the third game there are many occasions where you and your partner can see and interact with each other, but it never really detracts from the atmosphere and puzzles. The hint system is a nice touch, though we did not use it almost at all so I can't say how helpful it was. While this game has some really fantastic puzzles and creative interactions, it also has some of my least favorite ones in the entire series. Several of them felt more lopsided than I would have liked, with one person standing around doing nothing but talking and the other person \"does all the work\". Despite that this is still one of my favorites of the series and it finally gives us some closure for this story. [spoiler] Even if that ending is extremely unsatisfying.
