I very much enjoyed the Defect in multiple runs for the Orb mechanisms as it felt like another extension of the game-play. \n\nAs this game includes Rogue-like elements; expect to replay the Spire multiple times in order to unlock more Cards and Relics to enhance the chances of \"winning\" a run in the first mode. \n\nThere's more modes that are available especially after completing one run successfully. \n\nUnlocking the Watcher was an interesting experience especially after I became more aware on how the Defect operates with Orbs. The Watcher plays on \"Stances\" usually hence getting the timing correct does satisfy the more tactical side of what I look for in games. \n\nUnlocking the Custom Mode was fuflilling to play at least once after getting experienced with the game; being able to emplace modifiers that allow enemies to drop Relics instead of Cards provided a surprising challenge and change of strategy from the usual play-styles. There's also modifiers to make the game much harder and the Daily Challenge Mode does provide inspiration on possibilities within Custom Mode. \n\nThe Card Art has an interesting cartoon aesthetic and seeing the Watcher's Cards is rewarding as it's far more vibrant than the other characters - it makes me wonder if the artists involved were more experienced with palettes when the later patches were added. Every character is distinct from each other. \n\nThe game can also be modded, has a Steam Workshop, and there's mods to help load other mods. \nThis extends replay value as trying mod-character decks that are up-to-date with the latest patches is a pleasant experience. \n\nOverall; it took me awhile to get into this game and study it's replay-value however the surprise in seeing how the game does reward persistence is satisfying especially when learning on what decks the game favors.\n\n\"Slay the Spire\" has taught and trained me on how good this genre can be when developed and patched correctly. For that; this game is an excellent proof of design. \nCongrats to the development team and everyone who was involved in the development of \"Slay the Spire\".", "timestamp_created": 1693109124, "timestamp_updated": 1693130868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703991472721099854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140913850": {"recommendationid": "140913850", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025155722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1927, "last_played": 1691766005}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought cracks were addictive till I play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1688056828, "timestamp_updated": 1688056828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703176498413085938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140356773": {"recommendationid": "140356773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198795876165", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1078, "last_played": 1693882830}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like card and deck building games, you'll like this one too\n\neach run is relatively short (~1 hour) but death is permanent (like Hades except there are no permanent upgrades)\n\nwhat you retain is your knowledge of the items and your play style (or what you need to change about your style) and that's how you enjoy the game, by experimenting with each run.\n\nit's a great game, have fun.", "timestamp_created": 1687211734, "timestamp_updated": 1687211734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698515772819519043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124059919": {"recommendationid": "124059919", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122477921", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1946, "last_played": 1684388678}, "language": "english", "review": "i failed algebra this game makes me cry", "timestamp_created": 1666162813, "timestamp_updated": 1666162813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697616994380950928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132491936": {"recommendationid": "132491936", "author": {"steamid": "76561199069512892", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12653, "last_played": 1680293757}, "language": "english", "review": "I could play this all day every day", "timestamp_created": 1675981461, "timestamp_updated": 1675981461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692577838897705078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142255034": {"recommendationid": "142255034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068951747", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2026, "last_played": 1691915361}, "language": "english", "review": "getting my ass beat has never been so fun", "timestamp_created": 1689583784, "timestamp_updated": 1689583784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691038668155670166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134538910": {"recommendationid": "134538910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083387799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7346, "last_played": 1684804052}, "language": "english", "review": "Coming from someone who played a lot of Magic: The Gathering.

[/h1]\n\nOkay let's just get right into this, shall we?\n\nYou'll be battling your way up this mystical spire, collecting cards that determine your moves in combat. It's pretty straightforward at first, but the real depth comes from the relics you find. These relics define your run and add some exciting twists to your strategies. You'll face tough choices, like whether to go for a powerful card that might mess up your current deck strategy or take a relic that changes your whole approach.\n\nWhat I loved most is the constant reevaluation of your deck. Every battle presents an opportunity to get new cards, which means you're always reassessing and fine-tuning your tactics. It can get pretty complex, especially when you have a ton of cards and relics to manage, but that's part of the fun.\n\nThe battles themselves are a blast too. Early on, it's quick and snappy, but later, you'll be carefully plotting each move to make the most of your limited resources. Timing and planning are crucial, and when your plans come together, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling.\n\nI  did some research found this game has a presence on IOS and android. So I downloaded bluestacks and emulated the game. Yep! I played it on mobile, and it works like a charm with the touchscreen. \n\nAlthough I have to admit, I enjoyed using a controller more for that snappy input. Either way, it's a blast to play on the go. But seriously, get this on your steamdeck or the Nintendo Switch, you'll thank yourself later.\n\nThe best part of this game I will say is the replayability. Every run feels fresh, and you'll be itching to try new combinations and strategies. Sure, there's some randomness involved, but most of the time, you can pinpoint your mistakes and learn from them.\n\nNow, it's not all perfect; there were moments when I felt overwhelmed by the complexity, but it's usually when I took breaks and had to reorient myself. Still, failing never felt frustrating because it often boiled down to my choices, and that's a big plus.\n\nSo, if you're up for a challenging, strategic, and addictively fun game, \"Slay the Spire\" is a must-try. The blend of deck-building and roguelike mechanics is masterfully done, and you'll find yourself diving back into that spire over and over again.

Plus, as you continue to play and unlock new cards and relics, you'll find even more ways to fine-tune your deck and make it truly your own. \n\nThat being said, the game can be frustrating at times due to its somewhat reliance on RNG and luck-based events.

This card is called Pot of Greed. When activated, you perform the following ritual: First, you must move your hand to a position in space/time where it is hovering just above your main deck. Then, you must place your middle finger and pointer finger on the backside of the top card of your main deck. Hopefully you are of the homo sapiens species, or at least a primate, because you must have opposable thumbs to proceed. Place your thumb on the bottom edge of the top card of your main deck in a way that creates a grip of this card in tandem with your middle and pointer fingers. Now you must engage multiple muscles in your hand and arm to raise this card up from the main deck in a way that does not reveal the face of the card to your opponent. While keeping the card hidden, you must move it towards your hand, and slide it in amongst the other cards in your hand. Note: at this stage, your hand should now contain one more card than it did before this ritual began. This whole process is called a \u201cdraw.\u201d Now here\u2019s the tricky part. You must perform another draw in addition to the draw you\u2019ve just completed. This is where most people get lost. There should be a total of TWO cards drawn from the top of the main deck added to the hand. Once you\u2019ve performed your SECOND draw, the number of cards in your hand should have now increased by a net total of TWO cards since the activation of Pot of Greed. If this is not the case, you have certainly botched the procedure in some horrific way. A good way to check if you\u2019ve performed the steps correctly would be to count the number of cards in your main deck before you activate Pot of Greed and after you\u2019ve resolved Pot of Greed. According to high level calculus, there should be a total difference of TWO cards between these two main deck card counts. To be more specific, there should be two less cards in the main deck after Pot of Greed has resolved than there were before it resolved. As a side note, it is common practice to explain aloud to your opponent and any possible spectators what Pot of Greed does before you resolve its effect. If you fail to do so, it could result in mass confusion for all parties involved, as Pot of Greed is understandably the most complicated card in all of  Y\u0336u\u0336-\u0336G\u0336i\u0336-\u0336O\u0336h\u0336  Slay the Spire.", "timestamp_created": 1681352656, "timestamp_updated": 1681352656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561054408550262451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136781803": {"recommendationid": "136781803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082758002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2074, "last_played": 1682211087}, "language": "english", "review": "Amusing and graphically pleasing light-hearted fantasy card-playing diversion.

Ten hours in, I couldn't detect a hint of a story or any interesting character plots (there are 4 playable characters all with no substance of motivation or lore beyond 2 sentences). Salt sprinkled over the wound, all enemies end up as generic and forgettable, even the bosses.

It's really unforgiving, and any wrong choice might cost your victory to the final trial. It could had been a Pro if it wasn't that unfair.\n- Going more specific about the gameplay, the enemies have some kind of regular pattern and are quite predictable, but your mechanic is based on the randomness of the Deck Building. You might be able to overpower some fights, but most of time, you get overwhelmed by the constant Enemy damage output going heavy.\n- About the Deck Building, the randomness is also occuring during your pick opportunities, not only during your draw while fighting. You may start to follow a type of build during the first Act, but it's not guaranteed to reach your perfect idea through the second and the last Acts. Having an incomplete build will crush you against the Final Boss.\n- I hate Deca and Donu.\n\nI could give a longer talk about this game, but I need to unlock all the contents that are still remaining.\nYou unlock contents through your runs, winning or losing them.\n\nEach Heroes has 5 ranks to unlock, giving more choices for cards and relics on your next runs.\nIt takes hours to get them, and at the moment where I did this review - played 25 hours, I managed to fully unlock contents for the first Hero, The Ironclad.", "timestamp_created": 1682008685, "timestamp_updated": 1682055808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556423187255859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130195167": {"recommendationid": "130195167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063387510", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 31241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26470, "last_played": 1690284781}, "language": "english", "review": "Games okay, played it a tiny bit.", "timestamp_created": 1672931159, "timestamp_updated": 1672931159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551511704921722412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130524062": {"recommendationid": "130524062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030808126", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 51758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51515, "last_played": 1673558619}, "language": "english", "review": "The defining masterpiece of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1673294747, "timestamp_updated": 1673541003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282048225402832", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123789647": {"recommendationid": "123789647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042873232", "num_games_owned": 1495, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 9327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5869, "last_played": 1676021311}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is written in Euskara.

The game is like climbing a tower, but instead of guns, you fight with cards.\n\nThe graphics may not be as impressive as Tripticon, but they do the job just fine. The gameplay is addicting, and every run is different. You start with a basic deck of cards and gradually upgrade and add new cards to your deck as you climb the tower.\n\nOne thing I particularly enjoyed was the variety of enemies you face. From cultists to gremlins to even a sneaky thief, each enemy type has their own set of strengths and weaknesses, and you have to adapt your strategy accordingly.\n\nBut be warned, this game can be challenging. I faced many tough battles and had to strategize carefully to emerge victorious. But that just made it all the more rewarding when I finally defeated the final boss.\n\nOverall, I give [b]Slay the Spire[/b] a Starscream-worthy [b]8/10[/b]. It's an addicting and challenging game that will keep you coming back for more. So, if you're looking for a game that will put your skills to the test, give it a try.

Pfft I thought, beating an elite on turn 1 could be done by a toddler. So just like any sane player, I boot up watcher, kill gremlin knob turn 1, and to my inevitable surprise, no achievement... Immediately my heart sank, it says BOSS, not an elite... with a heavy sigh and a deep contemplating look into the sky above, my journey began.\n\nNow I like to think I aint no Forest Gump and rather quick when it comes to most things, but this was harder than writing my university thesis. What kind of build would I need to beat a boss on turn 1 with no set up and 4 energy?! My head was cracking, I was losing hair, sleep, friends and my sanity. Irritated by the smallest of things, I was still on my chair at 2am trying to make ironclad infinite work. And just as I slimmed my deck to 7 cards, had bottled war cry that would draw me 2 on first turn, 2 potions that exhaust any number of cards and an energy pot just in case, I thought even Forest Gump couldn't mess it up.\n\nWith a hop and a skip I was heading for the boss in act 3, knowing I could finally go to sleep and attain the ultimate achievement - happiness. And just as the map moves ever so slightly after each node, the corner of my eye catches something that would make a seasonal vet shiver his timbers. Its the donut brothers. The colour in my face drained as I looked into my relics only to see no artifact removals. In that split second I knew all this was for nothing.\n\nAnd so with a heavy heart I clicked abandon. My ironclad fell and I was empty. The pale face was now red with anger and just like any normal person, I had to let it out on the spire. I boot up and take only strength cards. Heavily remove all the blocks, the spire will know not to mess with me. Neon reward gives me double strength card, we roll. I don't know what happened that night, but I was getting every card that was perfect for stress management, it felt like I was in a stress room, where I could smash plates onto the walls and hit things with my bat, except here I was hitting minions with 20-30 strength turn 1.\n\nAnd then it happened, without even going for the achievement, the stars aligned and I got enough flexes and doubled my strength to such a degree, my sword boomerang one shot act 2 boss. The ding sound at the bottom of my screen filled my brain with such joy that I aint sure it could ever be replicated, I have hit my dopamine peak.

This review endeavors to plumb the depths of this digital labyrinth, dissecting the nuanced interplay of mechanics, strategy, and design that has propelled \"Slay the Spire\" into the pantheon of celebrated titles. As we traverse the shadows and luminance of this deck-building expedition, it's paramount to unearth both its glimmering strengths and the occasional crevices that diminish its luster.\n\nCard Dynamics and Strategic Layers:\n\nMegaCrit's triumphant achievement lies in the elegant synchronization of a deck-building framework with tactical engagement. The acquisition and curation of cards, akin to an intricate dance of tactical selection, introduce an addictive rhythm to the gameplay. Each card functions as a melodic note within the larger symphony of strategy, enabling players to craft unique synergies and adaptive tactics.\n\nThe diverse archetypes of cards - Attack, Skill, and Power - construct a trinity of strategic versatility. The interplay between these card types, compounded by relics that augment their effects, is a stroke of design genius. The game's elemental strategy lies in discerning the optimal cadence of cards to orchestrate devastating combos while remaining responsive to the challenges posed by the procedurally generated encounters.\n\nRogue-like Progression and Risk-Reward Nexus:\n\n\"Slay the Spire\" orchestrates an intricate balance between the reward of exploration and the perilous prospect of defeat. The ever-shifting layout of the titular Spire, laden with unpredictable encounters and treacherous foes, culminates in a dynamic rogue-like tapestry. Players are compelled to weigh the potential rewards against the mounting risks, a cognitive duality that underpins the tactical allure.\n\nDeath, in the game's context, doesn't denote failure but the opportunity for iterative improvement. The progression system, wherein unlocked cards, relics, and characters persist across runs, is the centrifugal force that propels players toward mastery. The perpetual loop of learning and growth lies at the heart of the game's roguelike narrative, accentuating the dance between adaptation and persistence.\n\nStrategic Depth and Character Diversity:\n\nThe roster of characters, each imbued with distinctive mechanics and playstyles, forms the crux of \"Slay the Spire's\" strategic depth. The Ironclad, Silent, and Defect are virtuoso performances in asymmetrical design, each requiring a nuanced approach. The synergy between character-specific cards, relics, and playstyle fosters replayability, summoning players to master each character's symphony of tactics.\n\nYet, while the differentiation is laudable, occasional asymmetry imbalances have been reported, casting transient shadows on the strategic equilibrium. Certain character-card synergies can unintentionally tilt the scales, highlighting the fine line between challenging complexity and unintended frustration.\n\nPresentation and Aesthetic Harmony:\n\n\"Slay the Spire's\" visual ensemble is a testament to the marriage of minimalism and thematic coherence. The striking card designs, akin to stained glass windows narrating an arcane saga, transcend mere aesthetics to inform the mechanics within. The sparsely adorned character and enemy sprites serve as archetypes, affording room for player imagination to animate their narrative.\n\nThe auditory backdrop, while understated, encapsulates the ambiance of the Spire. The mellifluous resonance of card draws and shuffles melds with the symphony of clashes and clashes, guiding players through the tactically charged journey without drowning out the strategic overtones.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\"Slay the Spire,\" MegaCrit's magnum opus, unfurls as a deck-building odyssey imbued with strategic depth and progression intricacies. Its symphony of cards and archetypes, fortified by rogue-like progression, beckons players into an immersive dance of strategy and risk. Amidst its rapturous cadence, the occasional asymmetrical imbalance serves as a sobering reminder of the intricate equilibrium demanded by complex systems.\n\nAs a testament to the genre's evolutionary narrative, \"Slay the Spire\" resonates as a masterpiece that bridges accessibility and depth. Its resonant card dynamics, character diversity, and presentation ensemble form a harmonious whole that, despite its minor dissonances, echoes with the enduring power of thoughtful design and strategic engagement.", "timestamp_created": 1692486146, "timestamp_updated": 1692486146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144574007": {"recommendationid": "144574007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044605611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 18561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18561, "last_played": 1692459075}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1692460097, "timestamp_updated": 1692460097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144469773": {"recommendationid": "144469773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378858027", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2747, "last_played": 1693115025}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty great game. \n\nThe art isn't great, the animations are not great, the overall presentation is not great. However the game play is very good and intuitive. It's very easy to get into but has enough complexity to get addicted to. Time fly's by extremely quickly when playing this game. The 4 characters are all extremely well thought out with their card design. Each one feels unique and they all play wildly differently. For the most everything is balanced and you can have tons of fun. Also the modding scene is tremendous they're so many mods for this game it is absurd. If you really love this game, mods can easily quadruple your play time.\n\nMy main problem is the small amount of content. After 8 or so runs with each character you kinda get to see all cards/play styles they have to off. At that point is it's just rnging into getting a good combo of the \"good\" cards to build a deck that wins. You can't really do much more then what the game gives you, the only branching out is if you get a random relic or event that completely changes the game but that is rng at the point, not skill. Also the enemies are kinda boring. They are not enough of them and they all have limited move sets, it does make them predictable so much so that playing the game for a long time, you can guess with almost 100% accuracy what they will do every time. However, they're still very limited. They're only a few final bosses and mini bosses. They consist of 2 or 3 actions at best, deal damage, debuff, or self buff. That's about it. The only real complexity is how often they or how hard they hit. It becomes a numbers game at that point.

Until now, deck building games have not held much allure for me \u2013 whether it was Hearthstone, Gwent or Hand of Fate, it\u2019s fair to say that I greeted each with the sort of excitement one might exude if they had to eat a turd sandwich for lunch (or indeed any other time of day). Therefore it would take a supremely rare offering to rally my attention, and Slay The Spire is absolute that and then some.\n\nSlay The Spire doesn\u2019t just raise the bar, it breaks it over the head of its genre brethren, stands atop the skyscraping pike of their corpses and places a new one \u2013 a golden, soaringly high standard that looks set to remain unbeaten for years.\n\nSlay the Spire soars as high as it does not just because it\u2019s a incomparable card-battler, but also on account of the fact that it blends in stellar roguelike mechanics to create an offering that far exceeds the sum of its parts.\n\nThe premise of Slay the Spire is as its name suggests \u2013 the goal is to climb up a tower and slay the titular Spire before moving onto the next act. Climbing the tower is no easy feat, with multiple paths available to you on your ascent to its peak, you\u2019ll find yourself fighting various enemies, tackling elite level foes, taking part in surprise events and uncovering a range of intriguing secrets. Though Slay the Spire has three different characters to choose from, at the beginning of the game only one is selectable \u2013 The Ironclad, while the other two, The Silent and The Defect both remain locked until you\u2019ve completed playthroughs with each character.\n\nWhen combat kicks off in Slay the Spire, the player is presented with a deck of cards that straddle a number of different categories such as attack, defence, skill and power. In addition to the unique properties of each card, an energy rating is also assigned which means that you can only play as many cards as you have energy for (the default energy reserve is three points).\n\nRunning parallel to the cards and the manner in which players can use them is the idea of enemy intent. Floating above the heads of every foe you face is an icon that corresponds to the action that they will take next; a weapon indicates an attack will come next, a shield points towards a defensive posture and question marks mean that you won\u2019t know what they intend to do next. As such, the key ingredient to any kind of success in Slay the Spire is playing cards that act contrary to the intent of your enemies. If an enemy is going to strike, then shore up your defences; if they are going to defend, then pummel them with as many attacks as possible.\n\nOf course like any deck-building effort, the fortunes of the player are ultimately subject to the dreaded spectre of RNG \u2013 after all, you can only do so well with the cards you\u2019ve got. Slay the Spire negates the effect of RNG to a great extent by simply allowing players who are prepared to stand a far better chance than those that simply aren\u2019t. From the building of a deck, to knowing when to use what potions when and collecting relics which provide passive bonuses and effects in every fight, Slay the Spire fully equips the player to succeed, so when the wicked RNG does eventually strike against your interests, it never feels unfair.\n\nThat willingness to allow players to define their own path to victory, is prismatically represented in the three characters that you can choose from at the beginning of every playthrough. Each of the three heroes is very different from one another in terms of stats and starting boons \u2013 the Ironclad heals some health at the end of every fight, the Silent draws an additional two cards at the start of every fight and finally, the robotic Defect begins every encounter with a channeled lightning orb that inflicts damage at the end of every round. Every character is different and every one demands a unique approach be taken.\n\nThis prismatic approach is brilliantly reflected in the various enemies you\u2019ll tangle with too. A veritable horde comprised of some deeply varied bad dudes, each enemy has its own strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies that, more than often not, are built around the subversion of Slay the Spire\u2019s base tenets. For example, you\u2019ll get some enemies who attack you with negative status effect cards which get shuffled into your deck, eventually forcing you to play them as they flood your hand. Another example are the elite monsters, each of which possess a range of dynamic abilities that shift and change during the fight; constantly forcing you to improvise on the fly.\n\nAnd then there are the Spire bosses themselves \u2013 extremely powerful, multi-faceted enemies that demand your character to be effectively developed with a mind for shifting strategies to match, once beaten not only do they yield significant material rewards in the form of money and empowering relics, but they also provide satisfaction in the form of a pure, unadulterated hit of euphoria. A true gaming moment if there ever was.\n\nIf all this sounds like it might be overwhelming, Slay the Spire\u2019s provision of a sophisticated, fantastically well-balanced deck-builder is matched by its commitment to making it all clear and effortlessly easy to understand. After a brisk though informative tutorial sets out the basics of the mechanics and how things hang together, the easy to navigate menus coupled with bright colourful cards and a vivid UI all entail that Slay the Spire is never less than a constant, breathlessly easy offering.\n\nLike all the best roguelikes, Slay the Spire not only knows how to reward you after each attempt, but it has an innate understanding of second guessing what the player wants to do next. Though the experience points provided for each playthrough lead to the levelling up of each character provides a range of additional, more powerful cards to use in future attempts, and in turn provides a persistent progression backbone for the game, it is in the numerous carrots that are dangled in front of the players nose where Slay the Spire truly excels.\n\nBetween fights Slay the Spire shows a progress map which shows the paths one can take to the top of the tower. Along that path, treasure chests, points of rest and card upgrade zones can be spied \u2013 allowing you to plan the best way through in order to yield the most productive and result for your character and by proxy, giving you something to look forward to.\n\nThrowing an entertaining wrench into these proceedings are the unknown events strewn along each trail which conjure all manner of odd happenings \u2013 from goblins mugging you, to ancient traps, tombs, treasures and other such discoveries, each of them has a risk/reward component that makes you look forward to discovering the next event.\n\nBeyond the irresistible pull of the pursuit of loot and glory in the standard campaign mode itself, Slay the Spire augments its offering with an Ascension mode which triggers once you complete the game. Essentially a riff on the New Game Plus mechanic, Ascension lets players tackle the campaign with more difficult enemies which in turn proffer much more powerful cards and rewards when vanquished. The kicker here though, is that Ascension only triggers on a per character basis, and so Slay teh Spire does a slyly grand job of making you want to play, and become accustomed with each of the trio of heroes.\n\nFor someone who has previously found the mere notion of a deck-building game exhausting, let alone entertaining the act of actually playing one, Slay the Spire is nothing less than a revelation. Betwixt its superior melding of deck-building with roguelike beats and the effortless, deeply welcoming fashion which acclimates even the most obstinate opposers of the genre, Slay the Spire feels akin to an old friend whose seemingly limitless depths are only matched by the warm generosity of its embrace.", "timestamp_created": 1686160080, "timestamp_updated": 1688936672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139610502": {"recommendationid": "139610502", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098892897", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1520, "last_played": 1687652838}, "language": "english", "review": "A challenging game with a play style for most.

Not because I\u2019m torn, but I\u2019m unanimous in my praise but it\u2019s really hard to place why without fearing spoiling the aspects of discovery of the synergy of mechanics in this game. I have tried to write this review several times. I sank like 70 hours in no time, one after another right after getting my ass kicked. And I still feel like there\u2019s so much I can do and learn. There are many reasons I can place that make it feel different to other rogue-likes and it comes down to the tight synergy and variety, the degree of choice and chance, and the impeccable sense of balance.\n\nThe game is simple: you start with 3 energy, use those to play cards to help block, attack, or later on use a power. You can read enemy intents, the enemies themselves have a clear behavior and a general pattern. It places it in a different spot to other card games. As a single player game, your goal is not to consider an opponent playing in the same rules as you with their own deck, not against a horrible AI or just cheating odds. You are instead using your wits and taking chances to try and become a David against a Goliath near the end. Where you start with only 3 energy and 80 HP facing a 420 HP behemoth but string cards well enough to empower each other through them feeding strength or block through some mechanic through each other well enough to well, Slay the Spire.\n\nAnd it feels great. So great.\n\nThe name of the game of Slay the Spire is synergy. It is using cards and relics to cyclically boost each other's attack, block, energy, card draws. It makes for a very interesting, dynamic style of play, a feeling of cleverness as you use your wits to form interconnected dynamical play. Those wits aren\u2019t just in battle but also happen while you are always in the question of how you should build your deck or which relics to go for, as you learn to build a deck to enforce these synergistic powers to your best advantage.\n\nThis game's novel style of deck building creates a constant intrigue and engagement. It\u2019s not just about picking the right card you already have but making do with what you have, considering whether to go a certain direction as certain kinds of cards come, and weighing what you\u2019ll encounter in the future, constantly engaging in a creative way to see what you can make work as a dynamic strategy emerges. This is probably the first game where I felt the luck, that element of chance, is one that is genuinely what makes it so great. It adds uncertainty, unsure of how things will pan out while not being unfair. It stops the game from making it a purely theoretical computational study.\n\nI imagine a possible feeling is that there are only 4 characters and so many cards. This is where I\u2019ll note every character feels completely different, usually with entirely different mechanics their cards can employ. They each have their own colorful feel to them. Ironclad is heavy, tanky, iron on iron. The Silent is crafty, using numerous weak cards to build something very effective, and a variety of tricks to avoid attacks. The Defect is robust and high-tech, preparation and power oriented. The Watcher is focused on foresight, planning, manipulating the deck, and right time right place type play. These descriptions alone do a dis-service to underlying the real extent of the layers the characters have. There are enough cards to support all kinds of different kinds of plays, different \u2018archetypes\u2019. Between the characters, even similar archetypes (eg, the energy building card drawer) feel different because of the manner they are incorporated, broadly in the style described above.\n\nEvery character I had a moment where I felt \u2018this is the best, they\u2019re my favorite\u2019 and characters I might not have instinctually gravitated to as much showed their deeper colors very quickly and I feel they\u2019re all amazing. It\u2019s hard to explain so it\u2019s not just anything they do, they each genuinely feel so different and colorful. They are distinctive enough and with enough layers that among my many runs I can still name off all kinds of different builds and ideas, all completely distinct.\n\nMost amazingly? There is not one character or build I feel is really better than the other. The kind of build I first used to really beat the game was not one I had thought would have been viable, I didn\u2019t even use cards to boost a certain aspect I thought must have been required. And the other I used to \u2018beat\u2019 the game on my first run was a quite spastic deck relying on random costs, 0 cost cards, and drawing to just overpower which was a completely different approach to the other strategy.\n\nI notice when I play a different character, other kinds of enemies that I didn\u2019t struggle with before become harder, but other aspects help others. The different enemies encountered each have felt designed to act as a possible deterrence of one possible weakness of a deck, but it's spread out differently over the different enemies. Because the characters and builds are different, there will always be an enemy of this form and it gives that degree of chance that feels so balanced among every possibility of your build. It's not really the enemies alone that are meant to give the fight interest as much as the context of those enemies, your chances, and your kind of build and how it works.\n\nIf there is one thing I credit to all this, it is *because* the game is a bit more lean. It makes it incredibly tight, allowing all these close together synergistic connections. It allows it to be very well balanced, to let that element of chance really work and keep you coming back for more.\n\nI also want to comment on the art and characters a bit since I quite like them and it grew on me. It\u2019s a bit more for lack of a better term flat but it feels fitting and the aesthetic is well tied throughout the cards, enemies, characters, and UI. The characters are also a lovely unique diverse distinct cast whose card styles, art help build entirely different images of what you\u2019re doing. The music is not per se anything to sing home on about but it does provide the right sound for back to back plays, the foreboding dungeon theme saying \u201cready to go again?\u201d.\n\nA small note to add is there is also a modding community. Slay the Spire laid the groundwork for a new approach to single player card games and that framework has been used for people to infuse their own characters with their own cards, even new relics and enemies. I personally tried my hand at a time stopping Sakuya Izayoi, The Servant, a magic building Reimu, or a soul building mechanic for the knight of Hollow Knight. There are others of generally more acclaim and balance. Or, you can just become Saitama and kill everything in one punch. I found these all interesting if quite a bit harder to use.\n\nOn the whole, Slay the Spire comes off as a very unassuming game at first sight but I urge anyone to give it a chance and see it through a bit farther to uncover this immaculate tight blend of synergy, variety, and balance.", "timestamp_created": 1685035701, "timestamp_updated": 1685035701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138872945": {"recommendationid": "138872945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020274850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3566, "last_played": 1684893484}, "language": "english", "review": "Art : 50/50\nGameplay : 50/50\n\n~~~   \nArt\n~~~\n   \nAt first the illustrations and paintings in this game appear charmingly amateurish, like well received pieces by a talented but untrained artist on the second page of deviantart.

Though I enjoy deck building games (most underappreciated: the indie \"To Arms!!!\" on mobile), I don't know, stills of this game never could quite win me over. And people kept saying \"RogueLite\" over and over and Rogue-type games are really hit or miss with me.\nBut then StS went on sale, and I'm like, \"Okay, I'm ready to try this.\"\nWell! I'm glad I took the plunge. The way different card effects interact with each other...and then with relics...can help you set up some really fun combos. And the systems feel very clear to me; not intentionally obtuse or, you know, \"Raises damage by 0.006% per stitch in the toes of your currently equipped socks\". FUN. That's the word I'm looking for. Clearly designed and FUN. NOT punishing!\nMaking progress in this game feels doable. Or sometimes you just wanna see how far you can go on dumb decisions before you die. \n\nI also was unaware of the sense of humor this game has--but now that I'm playing, I love it (I see, you Plants vs Zombies sunflower!). It's charming!\n\nAnyway, easy to pick up, hard to set down. Might have to get this for Switch, too, and I'm not one to buy across different platforms.

I have now played for around 120 hours. I can say I know all the characters, cards, and relics, but I cannot say I've well mastered any of hte four characters. MegaCrit is a real master in disigning and balancing the strength. A0, A10, A20 all have significant difference. The only way to upgrade is to learn and grow more and more experienced. Luckily, SS have good cummunity cultures both in Chinese and other languages, those who are more experience are always willing to share their ideas.\n\nArtwise, the music and drawings are okayish, there are lots of card games doing better than SS. The story is strongly underestimated. SS is telling a really interesting yet mystereous story but not every player is really thinking why they are climbing while they are doing so. Although SS is not perfect, it catches the key point, the mechanism, that's what really counts. Anyway, SS is too damn interesting as a card game.

Developed by MegaCrit, it offers a unique and addictive gameplay experience that keeps players coming back for more.\n\nThe game is set in a fantasy world where you play as a character climbing a tower. Each floor of the tower presents new challenges, enemies, and rewards. You start with a basic deck of cards, and as you progress through the tower, you'll acquire new cards and relics that enhance your abilities and make your deck stronger.\n\nOne of the best things about Slay the Spire is how well-balanced it is. The game offers a range of strategies and playstyles, so you can tailor your deck to your preferred approach. Whether you want to focus on dealing massive damage, generating massive amounts of block, or using intricate combos, there is a playstyle that will work for you.\n\nAnother standout feature of Slay the Spire is the sheer amount of content available. With three characters to choose from, each with their own unique cards and abilities, there is a ton of replayability. Additionally, the game has a variety of game modes, such as daily challenges and custom runs, that add even more variety.\n\nThe game's graphics and sound design are also top-notch. The art style is unique and appealing, and the sound effects and music are immersive and add to the overall experience.\n\nThe only real downside of Slay the Spire is that it can be quite challenging at times. The game requires a lot of strategy and planning, and there will be times when you'll hit a wall and need to adjust your deck or strategy to progress. However, this difficulty only adds to the satisfaction of overcoming challenges and makes the game even more rewarding.\n\nOverall, Slay the Spire is an outstanding game that is well worth playing. It offers a unique and addictive gameplay experience, a ton of content, and excellent graphics and sound design. If you're a fan of deck-building games, roguelikes, or just great games in general, then Slay the Spire is definitely worth your time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1683055458, "timestamp_updated": 1683055458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523622035980224609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132349589": {"recommendationid": "132349589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204771367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 5931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 994, "playtime_at_review": 3982, "last_played": 1696468872}, "language": "english", "review": "who up slaying they spire", "timestamp_created": 1675737418, "timestamp_updated": 1675737418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523622035980224609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144102948": {"recommendationid": "144102948", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098088708", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 198, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1696295004}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun roleplay game for guys who are into strategic games.

Without a doubt, one of the most impressive plays ever set in osu! history, but one that takes some experience to appreciate fully. In the 12 years that this map has been ranked, chocomint's score remains the ONLY DT FC, and there's much more to unpack about this score. While some maps easily convey how difficult they are through the raw aim, or speed requirements, Made of Fire is much more nuanced than it may seem at first glance. To help illustrate just how difficult this play is, I would like to break down and analyze aspects of the map and the play itself. Right off the bat, we get a sense of the density of the notes, and the reading difficulty associated. With DT applied, the map becomes around 243 bpm, and approximately AR 9.67, a higher note density than most players are used to. Still, this should be manageable, but adding to the difficulty is the constant rhythm of, and spacing of the patterns which continues for the entire map. These would already pose a significant challenge to players' rhythm sense, reading, and finger control, but with hidden, the reading becomes MUCH harder. This is all bread and butter to someone like chocomint, who plays maps with similar patterns all the time, but everything we've gone over is just the beginning. Ask any top player what the hardest part of Made of Fire is, and they will all say the aim control. Many of the patterns in this map are continuous with strange velocity and angle changes, which need very fine adjustments in a player's aim to hit. None are more apparent than the various zig-zag patterns, which appear in the highest spacing sections. These require a player to aim to each note in a 1/4th beat time window, while potentially changing to an almost opposite direction. This is where chocomint shines, as almost no players have the level of aim control which he does. Bringing it all together is where the magic of this play really lies. DT alone makes the aim control barely in reach for any other player, but adding hidden makes these highly control-intensive patterns nearly impossible. Following the rhythm on such a map can be hard already as well, and trying to keep high accuracy, given the layout of the patterns, becomes ridiculous too. The real challenge is diverting focus between the aim aspect and the tapping aspects of the map, while keeping your reading in check as well. Keeping up with the map the entire way through to such a degree is exactly why chocomint's play is so astonishing. It's hard to put into words how much skill goes into a play like this, but to get an idea, I recommend trying the map for yourself. chocomint's HDDT score truly is in a league of its own when it comes to the aspects described earlier. Just over 2 years after it was set, some players are now approaching DT FCs, but not with nearly as high accuracy, and the majority lacking hidden. For now, it will remain a dream play for every top play, and a reality for chocomint. Hopefully this video has given you some more insight into, and appreciation of, one of osu!'s best plays of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1672152594, "timestamp_updated": 1672152594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129037451": {"recommendationid": "129037451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213416016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8271, "last_played": 1689704074}, "language": "english", "review": "too lazy to think of a review. it's good.", "timestamp_created": 1671732464, "timestamp_updated": 1671732464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127806003": {"recommendationid": "127806003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006747443", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2824, "last_played": 1687224488}, "language": "english", "review": "Innovation and grace.", "timestamp_created": 1670035064, "timestamp_updated": 1670035064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127766881": {"recommendationid": "127766881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114443846", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1619, "last_played": 1687397259}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

What it lacks in story and visuals, it more than makes up for in gameplay. And then some. Anyone who swears by [i]gameplay is king[/i], ought to dive headlong into this game. At the risk of sounding platitudinous, StS is easy to learn but hard to master. In this case however, that hackneyed expression is more than warranted.\n\nThrough four procedurally generated yet directed acts you climb the Spire floor by floor where you will encounter enemies, elites, bosses, merchants, treasure rooms, rest sites and events. Four playable characters are at your disposal, each with varying playstyles due to their starting decks, available cards, and obtainable relics. This is where the game\u2019s magic happens: the interlinking effects and boundless synergies between various cards themselves and the boons provided by the relics.\n\nDo not be fooled by clamors of brutal and unfair RNG. StS rewards game knowledge, statistical analysis, and contextual valuation. Learn the ropes and know the score. In time, Ascension 0 (lowest difficulty) will be a breeze. Ascension 20 (highest difficulty) however, is another can of worms and provides even the most experienced players a formidable challenge. Unless they play the Watcher naturally.\n\nAccessible yet exacting, endlessly replayable yet predictable, StS offers a brilliant and refined gameplay experience to anyone willing to look past its meager visuals. Add this write-up to the immense pile of laudatory reviews singing StS\u2019 praises. Be ready though when encountering the merchant: the rug is not for sale. All I ever wanted was that rug, man.

Each character has a unique set of cards that can be upgraded and customized as you progress through the game. Figuring out the optimal combinations and playstyle for each character adds an extra layer of depth and strategy to the game.\n\nOverall, Slay the Spire is a fantastic game that I highly recommend to fans of card games and roguelikes.

This outcome of sequential bad turns is more likely when your deck is small, whereas when you make your deck larger you're more likely to randomly have a single bad turn. Either way, if the drawing of attacks and skills were separated in some way like having two separate draw piles (and yes I'm ignoring powers and curses, this concept would require many systems to be altered in some way and I'm not going to suggest how to fix all of it, I really just want to highlight the issue here). Point being, you *always* want some kind of useful options on a turn, the randomness of varied options each turn is core to the genre but when I think to other card games, the most fun and interesting turns I have are the ones where I have been given a variety of viable options that I have to weigh against each other and plan ahead, that is the randomness that actually makes the game fun and interesting, not randomly getting completely dead hands.", "timestamp_created": 1666432131, "timestamp_updated": 1666432131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501035928726196289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125012131": {"recommendationid": "125012131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014569512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 725, "last_played": 1675950247}, "language": "english", "review": "This game helped me kick my daily Hearthstone habit, it's gotta be of the most enjoyable deck builders out there", "timestamp_created": 1667684959, "timestamp_updated": 1667684959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500934183597564697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136618943": {"recommendationid": "136618943", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992024674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1677255479}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a deck builder. yeah.

I grew up playing traditional card games like Crazy Eights, Solitaire and Uno. I later got into Bridge, Rummy and Poker until Magic the Gathering (MtG) consumed my life for years.\n\nThese days though its hard to find people to play traditional card games anymore and Magic the Gathering and other CCG's are way too expensive to keep up to date with.\n\nA few years ago I discovered physical deck building games like Dominion, Thunderstone, Race for the Galaxy and many more. I had a ton of fun playing these, but again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so I turned to the PC. Several of these games have pretty good PC versions, but they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games. There are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down. That's fine when playing with friends at home, but over the Internet or alone against an AI it tends to get old pretty fast.\n\nThere have been quite a few digital card games recent years that are great, but most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even Magic the Gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cards.\n\nThen come Slay the Spire, A game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before I finally gave it a chance. This little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things I love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it I struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much I want to say.\n\n[b]Drawing your cards:[/b]\nThe reason I love card games today as much as I did as a kid is for the simple feeling you get when you are dealt your cards, you pick them up and see if you have a good hand. That rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets old, its why I got so heavily into Magic the Gathering, since apposed to games like Bridge or Rummy you get to draw new cards constantly. This is also true for deck builders and even more so with Slay the Spire than many others since you play your hand fast and don't have to worry about building your deck while you're playing it. This brings me to my second point...\n\n[b]Building the deck:[/b]\nSlay the Spire has done a genius move by taking the deck building aspects of a deck builder away from the action of playing. So when I am in a \"fight\" I don't have to think for 2 minutes about which card to get like you have to do in Dominion style games. After a fight is over you are rewarded with a selection of new cards and only then do you have to make decisions about what card to pick. And that choice is always informed by how the last battle went, so you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card. I really love building my deck as I play with it, its how I used to tinker with my MtG decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me. Slay the Spire has the incremental building of a deck builder, but without the constant \"stop and think\" style of play which slow those games down. This makes the pacing of the game much more interesting. You have an action phase, followed by a thinking phase. Rather than jumbling them both into each other.\n\n[b]Playing the cards:[/b]\nAll this would be for naught had the game not been fun to play. Thankfully the cards are interesting and have a ton of cool interactions with each other. There are many different types of decks you can build and they can often change and adapt as you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around. This makes the game extremely re-playable, more so than any other deck builder I've played. While games like Dominion and Thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play I simply find myself enjoying what I can do in Slay the Spire more. It also plays very fast, it flows a bit like Heartstone in that sense, unless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orders.\n\n[b]Best of both worlds:[/b]\nSince Slay the Spire is a digital card game rather than a physical one it is not restricted to the \"laws\" that govern how a regular card game plays. This means they can do a lot of stuff that simply isn't possible or takes too long for physical games. Each fight is against one or several monsters who before your turn indicate what they are going to do over their heads, which usually is either attack, block or apply some buff/debuff. This means what you do on your turn is informed by that. If the monster attacks, you block, if it blocks or buffs itself you attack. Having this kind of AI interaction in a physical game could be possible, but would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds. As you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of them, making each game a little easier than the previous. Its not just your deck that's getting better, its your ability to play it as well.\n\nThe game also has a lot of statuses such as buffs and debuffs - kind of like how MtG works, which is one of the reasons why MtG can take forever to play, but with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background. The digital version of Magic the Gathering handles these things for you as well, but since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than Slay the Spire.\n\n[b]Just one more turn...:[/b]\nI am also a huge turn based strategy fan, Civilization being my favorite game of the genre. That genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and on, one more turn at a time, even though I know I should have stopped hours ago. Slay the Spire does the same thing for me. Each game of Slay the Spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floor, if you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run. It plays similarly to a Rogue Like in that way, a genre that I've always been fascinated by, but never got very deep into, but Slay the Spire got its hooks into me very hard. It took me quite the force of will to say \"No\" to another game so I could take the time to write this review. I can't wait until its over so I can try out the latest patch. Which reminds me...\n\n[b]Early Access:[/b]\nThe elephant in the room in my opinion is the fact that the game is in Early Access. That to me is always a HUGE red flag. There are a few games though such as Factorio, Rim World, Subnautica, Prison Architect, Oxygen Not Included and others that actually listen to their community, provide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is. Slay the Spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question. The technical aspects of the game is top notch, it plays smoothly, there's a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks I've played it. With a clearly defined Roadmap that promise more content in a game I feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over. I have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today I would be more than satisfied with my purchase.\n\n[b]Finishing thoughts:[/b]\nThis is a game I am going to be playing for years to come and while it already has enough content to justify that today I can imagine limitless possibilities for it in the future. More game modes such as infinite, restricted cards, special relics or modifiers, new cards, more monsters, new characters, etc. I feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you don't really see all that often. It has taken the best from many different genres, combined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nI think Slay the Spire is a game we will be talking about for years to come as a genre defining game.

So when a friend told me I [b]had[/b] to play this one, I was skeptical. I do love card games and strategy - but I also have a lot of burnout from poor Early Access experiences and since my maternity leave is over and now I have to ugh, make money AND look after a baby, absolutely no spare time for gaming. So I surprised myself when I realized that three days after launching this, I'd managed to clock up 15 hours. \n\nThat pile of paperwork next to me, the unfinished laundry and my mums messages asking if I'm okay because she hasn't heard from me for a few days may be related in some way, but you can't prove anything! I was so tired last night I beat the final boss with the Ironclad for the first time, sent a screenshot to the friend who bullied me into playing the game (essential step), turned my PC off, walked to bed and fell asleep, to dream of deck building.\n\nDespite my friend having played double my hours and generally being vastly superior at games to me, his playstyle choices have been vastly different. He prefers Silent, the poison character, whereas I prefer Ironclad, the strength deck. He'd never used the style of deck I used to get my first win (barricade, massive armor stacking, dual wield into body slam) and I played with quite a few different deck types before settling on my winning synergy. Even though there are not a massive array of cards, there is a significant amount of choice and strategy in your play, coupled with constant adjustments needing to be made as you pick up relics and rewards.\n\nWith over 9,000 reviews (no I mean literally, that's not a meme) and overwhelmingly positive, you don't need someone slow to this bandwagon to describe the mechanics of the game. What I will say is this is a fun roguelike deck-building card game that is simple to grasp, hard to master and incredibly addictive. I'd love to say it can be played in short bursts when you have 30 minutes here and there, but only if you've levelled your willpower to max and can walk away from the PC.\n\nHighly recommended from me, even in Early Access, with hopefully even more content to come.\n\n\ud83d\udc96 If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow

It has monsters that you have to kill, cool moves you can do, \"levels\" that you need to go through, you know, video gamey stuff. It even has potions. Still, I decided to look at it as something a bit more than just a video game.\n\nI started off playing STS with zero deckbuilder experience. I struggled up till I finally managed to win a run. I eventually made it to the real final boss of the game, and I was like, yeah this is stupid difficult, do people actually win against this?\n\nFast forward a year later, and yeah people win against it. Not only that, but they win against it with handicaps. It starts off with one handicap. Then you get another. And another. It's like you already have the odds against you, but you stack them against you even more. And more, up to 20 different disadvantages to start off with. Yet people still win consistently at the game. How is that?\n\nAs I learned more about the cards. How they synergize. How to anticipate my opponents and make arrangements for the possibility of my meeting them, I started to understand. In this game, you're given a deck of cards. You can't control what cards you will find, nor what elites or bosses you will encounter. Never the less, through your own decision making, you can turn squalid conditions to your advantage and come out on top despite the odds.\n\nIn this way, I decided to view this as more than just a game. It's a simulation that demonstrates the power of making decisions that have thought behind them. Decisions that weigh pros and cons, that consider consequences. I learned that a bad situation, even if it is bad and will certainly end bad, does not have to be [i]as bad as it gets[/i]. By carefully considering options, studying the situation, one can mitigate whatever negative aspects exist in any given situation. If they are also lucky, or particularly gifted, they may even reverse it into a good situation.\n\nTo me STS served as a reminder of that, and as a good demonstration of how powerful this concept is. I was able to go from a situation I really was convinced was hopeless, to being able to regularly and casually beat that same boss that I thought was impossible a year back, with at least 10-12 different handicaps on top of that. All because I changed how I think and how I made decisions.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone.

Combats are fought by carefully picking cards which will trigger various offensive, defensive and strategic effects. Along the way, players will build their character thanks to random card, gold, and bonus drops, in hope of finally reaching the top and, eventually, restart from the bottom and/or compete in a daily run event. Three different playable characters are available, each with their own set of cards and unique gameplay. \n\nThe strength of the title is undoubtedly its combat and deck building mechanics, where players will have to improvise and make sweet, sweet lemonade of of runs that sometimes feel like the ultimate lemon storm; card and bonuses drops obtained after clearing a floor are random, and if a build will certainly evolve throughout a given run, how it will evolve is down to luck and very strategic choices. \n\nThere is something to be said about a heavy reliance on RNG. The game can at times feel frustratingly random in its difficulty (I almost beat it during my first run, then struggled for the next 8 hours). That said, card games are random by nature, and this formula is meant to appeal to players who enjoy facing strong and uncertain odds. To somewhat balance this built-in unfairness, though, the developers have implemented a forced flush mechanic, where unplayed cards automatically go to a flush pile after ending a turn. This system helps knowing what card will come next and allows nice little tricks such as digging in the flush pile for that one card that might very well change the issue of the battle. \n\nIf the combat and gameplay of Slay the Spire are a lot of fun, some other aspects could benefit from a lot more polish. The art is sometimes painful to watch (bonfire screens in particular need a lot more work) and I personally found the music and sound effect lacking impact. Too standard and repetitive to be immersive, no dynamic soundtrack, very few sound effects for the variety of cards provided, and generally forgettable themes; I do play on mute. That said, the game still being in early access, there is still hope for improvement and in any case, the art doesn\u2019t matter that much once a combat has started. \n\nTechnically, the only real downside of the game is its animations. With no variety whatsoever, they are also slow enough (even on their fastest setting) to account for a good 30% of a turn\u2019s time depending on how fast players take their decisions. With nothing to justify this length and no skip option, they increase the duration of single runs and decrease the fun/time ratio. Added to the general boredom of the first 2 or 3 fights, and a title that could be much more nervous currently suffers for an unequal pace that can become uncomfortable. \n\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nSlay the Spire is based on challenging and enjoyable mechanics, which palliate for its lack of artistic polish and uneven pacing. Its fresh, appealing formula is meant for challenge seekers, to which I recommend it even at its current price.

Cards like \"Draw a card. Discard a card.\" can become the absolute foundation of a deck, while a card like \"Deal 32 damage\" can be an absolute dead draw... depending on your other card picks. Relics, passive bonuses to your character, add another layer to consider. You have a relic that lets you keep drawing cards when you empty your hand - should you focus on 0-cost cards and eliminate your higher cost ones, when removing cards from your deck is a rare and expensive service? \n\nThe game's art style is unique, and while it may not appeal to everyone, it's at least refreshing and fun.

One of the very best games ever!\n\nMy favourite game as of 2021!\n\n[i]Normally I tell a bit about the story, however in this game it's kind of a mystery. During the game you receive bits of clues what's going on, but this is open for interpretation and imagination. I wouldn't want to spoil that experience. All I can say is that your character must climb the spire! [/i]\n\n[h2]Mechanics [/h2]\nEvery run starts with five strike cards, five defend cards, and two special cards specific for your character. You also get one start relic, tailored for your class. \n\nAfter every battle you can choose one of three cards. There are three degrees of rarities that can drop: common, uncommon and rare. All cards have of itself more power than the starting cards, and so it's imperative to add new cards, remove bad cards, and preferably find some powerful synergy. \nThere are three types of cards:\n- attack cards\n- power cards; these buff your character, giving a bonus during this battle. The power card is consumed upon use, while other cards typically are discarded. \n- skill cards; these can be many things, like defend, draw- or create cards. Basically everything that's not an attack or a power. \nCards can drop in upgraded form, or can be upgraded at campfires, random events, or during a battle. \n\nThroughout the spire there are also elite monsters, which give a greater chance of high quality cards, but more importantly they give a relic. Relics provide powerful bonuses all the time, a permanent power, sort of. They can dictate what the best strategy will be, or what strategy absolutely will not work. Like cards, relics also come in three rarities, and the rare relics are very very powerful! You typically obtain around five rare relics each run. \n\nBesides monsters and elite monsters there are also vendors, campfires and random events. You can choose your own route, selecting which types of events you prefer. For me, I always choose a greedy route with the most elites (and often pay the price for my gluttony!). \nEvery 16th level is a boss, which can be seen beforehand, so you can prepare your deck. \n\nIf you climb all the way to the top, you unlock a new ascension level. Each ascension level makes the game progressively harder. There are twenty ascension levels. Aside this, your character also receives experience. This unlocks powerful new cards and relics. \n\n[h2]Four protagonists [/h2]\n[b]Ironclad [/b] \nThe Ironclad is a warrior with a two-handed sword. Her key features are: \n- big attacks\n- exhausting cards from her hand (exhaust is remove card from deck this battle) \n- self damage for several benefits\nShe starts with a relic that heals her after each battle, making her the easiest to start with, because healing is not widely available. \n[b]The Silent [/b] \nThe Silent is a thief or a rogue with a dagger. Her key features are:\n- creating shivs in large numbers; zero cost attacks which can be boosted greatly! \n- poison; a damage-over-time that does damage at the start of your opponent's turn. \n- discarding cards (which enables other cards) \nThe Silent deals a lot of damage, but has very limited ability to heal. Her starting relic draws two extra cards on her first turn, making it easier to find powerful combo's. \n[b]The Defect[/b] \nThe Defect is a robot. It's key features are:\n- orbs; orbs are changed to provide damage, armour or energy. They can be triggered by cards or charging orbs when you have no empty slots, for an increased effect. Triggering consumes the orb. \n- power cards; it has power cards that boosts or create other power cards. \nSince many cards of The Defect work indirectly, it is very easy to die. It's very tempting to choose the wrong cards early in the spire, because you have memories of shining successes in previous runs, however lack the support for playing said card. It starting relic gives one lightning orb. \n[b]The Watcher [/b] \nAdded last year, The Watcher is a monk-like class. She is generally regarded as slightly easier than the other three. Her key features are:\n- stances; stances can give an immense bonus to damage, while the calm stance gives energy upon leaving the stance. \n- 'retain' trait on certain cards, meaning they don't discard at the end of the turn. \nThese two features scream combo! Her starting relic generates a card each turn that creates 1 energy and can be retained. Besides this she has cards with:\n- scry; look at x cards from the top of your draw pile, and either return or discard them. \nCombo combo combo!!! \n\n[h2]The Spire beckons! [/h2]\nI find it very fulfilling to play this game, although I loose most of my climbs, it's always very tempting to do another run. The average winrate of the best players is around 60%, so it's no shame to fail. \nI find passive effects really charming, so I have played mostly The Defect. And failed a lot, o boy! Even when you play 'bad', choosing a questionable strategy, sometimes you just get lucky. The other side of that coin is that some climbs are doomed to fail. Such is The Spire, and we accept this fact. \nGenerally when you reach ascension 20, you ought to have a good understanding of the game. Along the way we all make the same mistakes:\n- super-multi-attacking a character with thorns\n- omitting healing because of preferring upgrading cards\n- closing paths with elites while your deck is utter garbage \n- choosing only attack cards, or only defense cards. \nI generally choose too many cards because I like cards!! \nEvery run brings something new. I could literally play this all day. It feels a bit like many big free-to-play games can make you feel, but without the terrible business models. This is one of the best games ever made, period! \n\n97/100\n\n[i]For me, it's almost perfect. But I can think of one thing that could be improved, and it's a very personal thing. When selecting a next encounter, you have to give a very short mouseclick. Due to my illness I am not always able to do that. Frustrating! Oh, and for having a speedrun achievement, which is impossible for some people.

So I'll address the one thing I haven't seen any other reviews talking about.\n\nThe difficulty/complexity curve in Slay the Spire is about as close to perfect as it gets. Each of the four characters plays fundamentally differently, and each has multiple viable paths for building a deck. As you start learning the game, the first thing you'll be doing is unlocking additional cards and relics for each character, allowing those cards and relics to show up in future runs. These unlocks slowly ramp up the complexity of the game by providing the player with more options and hinting at new deck archetypes to shoot for in future runs.\n\nBy the time you've gotten all five unlocks on a character, you've likely won a run or two. Winning your first run unlocks the first of twenty Ascension levels for that character, each of which progressively makes runs on that character a bit more difficult in different ways, which are clearly noted in the character select UI.\n\nI haven't progressed too far into Ascension, as I'm still working on a final couple of unlocks, but even as a gamer who prefers to play games for story over mechanics, I am thoroughly impressed by how smoothly Slay the Spire eased me into the game. This is not to say the game is not difficult--it is unforgiving, moderately luck-based, and occasionally infuriating--but the developers have done a splendid job of crafting a new player onboarding ramp that makes it honestly difficult not to learn the basics of how the game works. I've never seen such a smooth onboarding for such a difficult game, and it makes the experience far more welcoming than it has any right to be, given how gleefully the RNG will royally screw you over at times.\n\nSo for casual to mid-range gamers wondering if Slay the Spire is too hardcore for them--well, it probably is, but it'll do a damn fine job of getting you to a point where, for at least a little while...for a few runs every now and again...you can be hardcore too.

The rush of getting that one card for your deck, or getting another card to change your mental process and possibly have you think twice about your build...As other reviews before me have said, it is a great example of a game that is easy to pick up, but hard to master.

Things seem ok at first, but before you know it you can find yourself in big trouble. I realized this only after 30 hours of my life suddenly vanished\u2026poof in the blink of an eye.\n\nLater I took another little peek inside, and there went 20 more hours. Where did it all go? It\u2019s still kind of hazy.\n\nOn its surface this game is so simple. You can jump right in and grasp the fundamentals in about 30 seconds. But easy to learn, hard to master, as they say. Not that I ever came anywhere close to mastering it, of course; although you can blame at least part of that on the unpredictability inherent to this genre.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t played one of these things before, basically what you\u2019re doing is navigating a series of turn-based battles using a set of abilities\u2013attacks, blocks, special powers, etc.\u2013that you assemble along the way like a deck of cards. Every turn, you draw a certain number of cards and use them to deal damage and defend yourself. The main challenge is in building an effective deck on the fly based on which cards you happen to find.\n\nFlexibility is probably your best friend there. While you can buy a few extra goodies from the shops you visit, mostly your\u2019re stuck with whatever they give you in the battles and other random encounters and you just have to make the best of it.\n\nYou may find yourself gravitating toward one sort of deck, but sometimes you just don\u2019t get the right cards and like it or not you\u2019re forced to change your plans. Problem is, doing that requires a pretty broad understanding of the cards and how they work together: which ones are key to build around, which ones are better early vs. later in the run, etc. At first you don\u2019t really have any idea what most of them do, so you end up having to learn a lot of it by trial and error.\n\nIf you want to sound fancy you can tell people you\u2019re building a heuristic, but it mostly comes down to observing what works and what doesn\u2019t. As you play you start to get a sense for how happy you usually are when particular cards turn up, and that tends to be a good rule of thumb. Or, you know, just go and read someone else\u2019s guide and give yourself a head start.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ve got a lot of decisions to make, starting with which route to take through each of the three main levels. Do I need more cards? That means I need to steer toward more battles. But then I risk taking more damage. How\u2019s my health doing? Do I fight that boss up ahead and maybe take a big hit in exchange for another magic item? I can heal at that campfire, but that means I don\u2019t get to upgrade another card. So how\u2019s my deck coming along? Do I really need to upgrade certain cards or can I get by with what I have? Do I need to thin out my deck more? Should I risk a random encounter for that, not knowing what I might get?\n\nThe whole game is one long balancing act like that, where you\u2019re constantly weighing what you have against what you need and what the risks are. Meanwhile, since there\u2019s no reloading from earlier saves, one wrong move can doom all of your efforts; but I guess that\u2019s the nature of these sorts of games.\n\nNow if this is starting to sound a little intimidating, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s not really that bad. At the basic level you just need to be relatively sensible about your choices and after a few tries that\u2019ll be good enough to get you through the fake ending.\n\nYou can do all of this with four different characters, and each one has a distinctive style that creates a totally different experience, which was quite an accomplishment. There are some cards and items to unlock for each character, but for the most part it\u2019s not a grindy game. The replay value really does come from engaging naturally with the challenges available.\n\nBeyond the fake ending I mentioned, there\u2019s also a real ending, and then 20 more difficulty levels that grow more and more insane. So there\u2019s practically endless content here if you want it, although the average player is probably going to tap out long before hitting the ceiling.\n\nOne issue is that healing opportunities are few and far between, so even though it feels pretty fast-paced you do have to play with an eye toward long-term survival. The odds say that sooner or later you\u2019re going to draw a bad hand, which can wreck everything if it comes at the wrong time. That tends to skew you toward certain strategies to smooth over catastrophic damage spikes, either by stacking armor across turns or by accelerating card draw. Also, energy (i.e., more actions per turn) relics are extremely powerful, and can make or break a whole run all by themselves. These sorts of things can place a practical limit on the amount of variety unless you really know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nPlus, I think some of the mechanics would be pretty confusing if you\u2019re not already familiar with how these card games work. I mean, it goes against every video game instinct to turn down a reward, yet that\u2019s often what you have to do to keep your deck small enough to be effective. Same thing with deliberately exhausting (that is, permanently discarding) cards, or removing cards from your deck altogether. It\u2019s not necessarily clear why you\u2019d want to do things like this, and you\u2019re pretty much left to figure it out by yourself. That\u2019s asking a lot of a newer player.\n\nThe more the difficulty ramps up, the more optimized and regimented your approach needs to be, and thus the more un-fun it probably becomes unless you\u2019re someone who really thrives on getting deep into the weeds and pondering every little nuance of this system. For most of us, after you\u2019ve seen the same encounters a hundred times it starts to wear a little thin.\n\nStill, you\u2019re dealing with high-grade, weaponized material here, and even at a low level it offers dozens of hours of entertainment.\n\nJust writing this is making me itchy to start another run.\n\n\u201cCome on, just a little taste\u2026\u201d\n\nOk, that\u2019s enough. Gotta go uninstall this right now before I end up losing my job.\n\n\n\nYou can find more indie game reviews at [url=https://oddlittlegames.com] oddlittlegames.com [/url] or visit my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34514756/] curator page.

Those are all deck-building tabletop card games. I also played Magic the Gathering (physical, never digital) extensively for two years, and Hearthstone for 3-4.\n\nIf you like deck-building, rogue-likes, dungeon crawling, being at the mercy of RNGesus, and dying frequently, then you will enjoy this game. Did I mention dying? You\u2019ll be doing a lot of that.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - I like the art style and detail in the character/monster models, cards, and relics (loot that gives bonuses). The animations are very basic - your character does not actually move and attack, but the sound effects are decent enough. The music is appropriate for the grim setting of dungeon crawling, however, I muted all sound within a few hours of playing in favor of my own playlist. I made a half-joke with my friend that because I care about deck-building in this game more than anything else, I would have preferred if there were no animations at all so I could play even faster (I play on the \u201cfast mode\u201d setting). There is no voice-acting or narration.\n\nThe game can be played entirely with a mouse, but you can also use the keyboard to select cards quickly (good for if you are trying to speedrun). The learning curve is slight to moderate depending on your experience with deck-builders - understanding how to make your deck more efficient (ex: pruning useless cards, focusing on synergy, and skipping rewards you don\u2019t need) will increase your chances of success tremendously. I recommend trying the daily climbs until you win because it will teach you combos (the map and rewards - or dungeon \u201cseed\u201d - stay the same, so you can learn from your mistakes) and overall card-crafting meta. The card descriptions are helpful, and you can always hover over debuff/buff icons for an explanation of each.\n\nThere are three characters to choose from, each with a different set of \u201ccore\u201d cards and unique playstyles. There are also neutral cards that are available across all classes. Card rarity consists of common (gray), uncommon (blue), and rare (yellow). Like most deck-builders, you will start off with a deck of basic cards. You obtain cards after defeating monsters, from certain events, and by purchasing them at the store. Attack cards deal damage, skills apply effects (including damage), and powers apply buffs and disappear from your deck until the battle is over. The \"\u201cexhaust\u201d attribute on certain cards means they are put into a separate discard pile that you cannot interact with unless you have a card (Exhume) that returns them to active play.\n\nAfter you select a character, the map for the first dungeon (there are 3 + 1 secret) will be shown. From here, you can select a starting point - I strongly suggest you trace each route (there are forks) to find your optimal path. Locations include monsters (these make up most of the route), ? events (can also be stores or battles), elite monsters, campfires (rest or upgrade a card) and stores. The end of each level is a boss fight (you fight 1 of 3 chosen at random), and each location is considered a floor - this is important to remember because after 150+ hours of playing I finally realized that a relic called The Maw (gives 15 gold for every floor you climb until the first time you spend gold at the store) activates on \u201cfloors\u201d and not \u201clevels,\u201d making it significantly more useful. \n\nDuring combat, you use Action Points (AP) to play cards. All characters start with 3 AP,  but there are relics and cards that increase that pool. Every card is upgradeable, and some of them involve a reduction in AP cost (or cost 0 AP to begin with). Battles are turn-based, so you will go through your actions first, then the enemy party will go next (regardless of their size). There is an icon above each enemy showing what they intend to do on their turn - this can range from attacking, buffing themselves, debuffing you, and other special things. At the end of your turn, all unused cards are discarded; when you have no cards left in your deck, you reshuffle. There is a relic that allows you to retain your hand across turns, and there is also a card that lets you hold one card (stackable). \n\nExperimenting with card combos is my favorite element in Slay the Spire. There is even a relic that allows access to cards from other classes, making the possibilities seem limitless. I saw a build where the player had 2 Flash of Steels (a 0-cost attack that deals 3 damage and allows you to draw one card} and was able - through the grace of RNGesus - to trim his deck down to just those two. This resulted in what is known as an infinite turn because he would keep drawing another Flash of Steel, and could only be countered by one boss that ends your turn whenever you play your 12th card (across all rounds). A poison-focused deck while playing as The Silent. Poison is a debuff that does x damage at the end of every turn and reduces by 1; if you can keep the poison counter high enough, then the enemy will stay in that state until it dies (or until it kills you). After playing for 160+ hours, I am still finding new card synergies. The dev team has also done a fantastic job listening to player feedback, regularly implementing bug fixes and game balances (for example, The Ironclad\u2019s Burning Blood used to heal 10hp - now, you need to upgrade the relic to recover that much.\n\nOverall, Slay the Spire is easily the best deck-building videogame I have ever played, and one of the top rogue-likes as well. At first, I was worried that I would get bored of the game because there were only 3 characters, however, Slay the Spire still finds ways to surprise me. Considering it is still in early access, I am perfectly comfortable recommending this title as a complete game even if the dev team suddenly decided to abandon development. If you have ANY interest in deck-building or rogue-likes, then I wholeheartedly implore you to try this game. You will not be disappointed. You will, however, die often. Seriously. \n\nNormally I try not to mention price because everyone\u2019s perception is different, but the $17.99 CAD is a steal, and I would gladly pay triple that for the experiences I received in return. This is the way early access should be used.\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\n\nDJSF [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/djsfsroguereviews]@DJSF's Rogue Reviews[/url]\n\nFor the full review, [url=https://djroguereviews.com/reviews/slaythespire]please visit my website[/url].\n\n[i]If you like this game try:[/i] Hand of Fate (1 and 2) and Monster Slayers.", "timestamp_created": 1544690401, "timestamp_updated": 1583975912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843856692314147949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46310787": {"recommendationid": "46310787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068882131", "num_games_owned": 6032, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 11526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6151, "last_played": 1658587274}, "language": "english", "review": "Slay the Spire has provided an unbelievable amount of entertainment.

You start by choosing a character class (two available for now, and they play significantly differently). The character then traverses a dungeon, picking up new cards for their action deck after each challenge, draft-style (i.e. you get offered three and choose one). Additional modifiers are present in the form of relics, that give you more bonuses, sometimes very powerful.\n\n(It should be noted that the good feeling this game achieves is partially due to the lack of bad/mediocre relics. Getting a relic is always a noticeable boon, which encourages more play and further exploration.)\n\nEach of the two classes has their own selection of cards with a bunch of different synergies. The strategy you want to tailor your deck towards, therefore, depends on which early relics and legendary cards you get. That makes each run different enough.\n\nGenerally, the game is more on the fun/random side than a serious tactical brain-teased (compared to very similar games like, say, the little-known [i]Card Quest[/i], in which every battle is a tough challenge).

The game consists of the player choosing from one out of 2 (final product will be 3) characters. Each character starts with a unique \"relic\" and some basic cards. For the first run you are forced to choose \"The Ironclad\" as your character. As you go through the spire you gain more cards and relics in order to reach the end.\n\nRelics are a large part of the gameplay which can make astronomical differences in terms of how your playstyle comes into fruition. Ironclad starts out with a relic that heals him 6 HP after each combat while the other available character \"The Silent\" start out with a relic that allows two extra cards to be drawn at the start of combat. As a player advances they will gain more relics through defeating elite enemies, chests, the merchant, events, and more. There are a total of 115 relics in the game which are truly the definition of a game changer in terms of items.\n\nCards are at the heart of this game. With each character you start of with the most basic of attacks and blocks. The game revolves around attacking, blocking, and status effects. Cards can give you block to negate a set amount of damage until your next turn, attack for a set amount of damage to single or multiple enemies, inflict status effects, and more. Cards can also trigger special properties like constantly gaining strength to attack or block to defend with. Every card in the game can be improved once. Cards are gained through completing combat, the merchant, events, and more. There are currently 3 variations of cards. The ones exclusive to Ironclad, the ones exclusive to Silent, and the gray ones which both character can use.\n\nThe mixture of variety in cards and relics obtained every run along with randomly generated levels really makes each run a different and unique experience. It allows players to experiment, test their luck, and strategize with playstyles. The game currently has three acts with a total of nine possible bosses the player can face. One of the three respective bosses for an act will appear during each run for each act. It can be very satisfying to battle up the spire to get to the end but the moment when the end is reached is just so... empty. It feels like it shouldn't be over, like there should still be more to fight, more enemies to put your long built up deck against. The feel of accomplishment is overtaken by the emptiness of just ending it but wanting to continue.\n\n[h1] Graphics/Sounds \t[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are unique, they seem synonymous with the gameplay. They complement each other and show the effort in making this game unique. To stand out and rise above the rest as something that is a visual pleasure. \n\nThe music gives a sense of adventure and helps set the mood for trying to slay the spire.\n\n[h1] Pros/Cons \t[/h1]\n\n[b] Pros\t[/b]\n\n+ Unique Graphics and good music to match with gameplay\n+ Large amount of replayability\n+ Good variety in relics and cards\n+ Good balance for gameplay\n\n[b] Cons\t[/b]\n\n- Only 3 Acts to beat before forced reset\n\n[h1] Personal Thoughts\t[/h1]\n\nWhen I started slay the spire I almost beat it in one run. I had cards to boost my strength to enormous amounts and the ability to siphon health effectively. I was so close, and then my deck just didn\u2019t draw what I needed. So then I tried to play The Silent and didn\u2019t get nearly as close. Then back to Ironclad and so on each time experimenting with cards and relics to find better strategies to go with the relics I obtained. It\u2019s a game that can be fun and it does not require constant attention. You could be writing a report (or a review) and be constantly checking back in to do your turn or an event and go back to working. It doesn\u2019t take away from the fun or enjoyment and it\u2019s easy to just hop in and have fun.\n\nI am however disappointed that after beating the game it was like a brick wall. I ran straight into it and just stopped, I had to restart because there was nothing beyond. If a person succeeded in beating the game in the first run I don\u2019t think they would be able to fully enjoy this game because it just kind of cuts you off there. Then what was the challenge? There was no need to change anything because it all worked the first time.  \n\n[h1] TL:DR\t[/h1]\n\nSlay the Spire is a truly enjoyable mix of rogue-like and card games. It blends naturally with graphics, gameplay, and music. There are currently 2 (out of a planned 3) characters to choose from each time you try with unique cards exclusive to each. Each run has different paths, events, enemies, bosses, and opportunities in order to keep the game fresh and fun.  Overall Slay the Spire is a great game to play that truly feels unique .", "timestamp_created": 1518049888, "timestamp_updated": 1574917281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 161, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832753002643585205", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109149550": {"recommendationid": "109149550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039691026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4747, "last_played": 1661086628}, "language": "english", "review": "CACAW!", "timestamp_created": 1643593229, "timestamp_updated": 1643593229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832144618034362793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72872798": {"recommendationid": "72872798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086157027", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 1575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 988, "last_played": 1606745845}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay: 11/10\nGraphics: It's card game \nSoundtrack: 8/10\nLength: \u221e\nWorth buying: Worth\n\n\ud83c\udf26\ufe0f---{Graphics}---\ud83c\udf26\ufe0f\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n\u262f---[Story]---\u262f\n\u2610 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\u2610 Make your own story\n\u2610 Its multiplayer what did you expect\n\n\u2694\ufe0f---{Gameplay}---\u2694\ufe0f\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Staring at walls is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\n\ud83c\udfb5---{Audio}---\ud83c\udfb5\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n\u2764\ufe0f---{Audience}---\u2764\ufe0f\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Humans\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f---{PC Requirements}---\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f\n\u2611 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n\u2620\ufe0f---{Difficulty}---\u2620\ufe0f\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\u2699\ufe0f---{Grind}---\u2699\ufe0f\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2611 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks/cosmetics\n\u2610 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level \n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second life for grinding\n\u2610 Microtransaction wow yeah NO THANKS/ Battle pass F.U to\n\n\u06de---{Game Time}---\u06de\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n\ud83d\udcb2---{Price}---\ud83d\udcb2\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Wait for that SALE drop \n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\u2610 Microtransactions for a good cause \ud83d\ude08\n\n\n\ud83d\udc1b---{Bugs}---\ud83d\udc1b\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\u2610 Fallout 76\n\n\nBest card game on steam <3", "timestamp_created": 1595041326, "timestamp_updated": 1595041326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.83002781867980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57174253": {"recommendationid": "57174253", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979373769", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 66311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14111, "last_played": 1679278297}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting AF, but not in a \"I'm ashamed of my addiction\" kinda way, more like \"I play a couple rounds every week and look forward to it\" kind way.

You build a deck with cards unique to each hero's pool of available cards and progressively defeat monsters/elite monsters/boss monsters moving from one act to the next. Along the way, you can stop by shops to buy cards/relics/potions or visit question marks for random encounters. Upon death (or defeating the final boss), your run ends and you carry over newly obtained cards into your overall card database. Then, you can do it all again from scratch.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\nSimple, hand-drawn artstyle. Not graphically intensive; art fitting the feeling of climbing through a tower filled with enemies.\n\n[h1]STORY:[/h1]\nThere is no real \"story\" beside the fact that you play as some lost wanderer who wants to conquer this tower and discover what lies at the top (again and again...)\n\n[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]\n\u2022The game is easy to pick up and put down whenever you have a small period of time for a run.\n\n\u2022Slay the Spire is highly replayable as no two runs are ever identical. You can make different choices with every run such as which next path to take, which card to buy/sell at the store, or even which character you want to play with altogether. \n\n\u2022There is no real \"end\" as you can continue to reclimb the tower with harder difficulties and overall debuffs attached.\n\n\u2022There are many mods available in the workshop in the forms of custom characters, custom decks, new game modes, new bosses, powerful relics, and more. \n\n[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]\n\u2022Not a real criticism of the game, but attempting to build certain decks to obtain some achievements is highly RNG dependent and thus if you are a completionist, you might find yourself spending hours upon hours doing so.\n\n[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]\n9.5/10\n\n[quote] Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t.

The fact that every run had the potential to be unique was what kept me playing the game, even if most of my runs ended in death it almost never felt frustrating.

Some easy to grasp game mechanics branch out into really intricate strategy of deck building, pathing your way through the Spire, risk management, which all builds up to very complex and satisfying game. You'll have runs and runs where you die due to your mistake, but the successful runs after that where it all come together are so satisfying.\n\n[u] The social aspect of the game [/u]\n\nEven though this is a single player game, I've found it that it's a great game to play with friends. After I showed this game to a couple of friends they all got it and that all ended up as a group of us playing it together on Discord. While one of us played others would be watching commenting on the decision making, giving advice, sharing our experiences that could be helpful and cracking jokes. It was a more fun experience than most of the multiplayer games I've played. I wanted to point this out because it seem like an aspect of the game most of the reviewers haven't considered.\n\n[u] Manage your expectations [/u]\n\nI've read through some of the negative reviews to get a sense what would be something people don't like about this game, and as far as I've seen it's seems to me that some players got into this game with expectations that miss the point of the game. This is a rougelike, so failure, repetition and RNG are part of the game. This is not a game where you find one strategy or deck which works and stick to it. It's all about making the best of the situation the game puts in front of you and adapting to it to in the best possible way. As far as we know there aren't [url=https://forgottenarbiter.github.io/Is-Every-Seed-Winnable/] any unwinnable seeds in the game [/url], even if they are theoretically possible.\n\n[u] Summary [/u]\n\nThis is not an easy game to play, but it's a really satisfying game to master. The mechanics are great and easy to grasp, ([i]\"You have it all in writing.[/i]\" is now a common saying in my group of friends while we play it) but the mastery of the game comes from learning the intricacies in the game and managing risk based on your knowledge of the game. For me it's one of the best games I've ever played as you can see from the time I've invested in the game, but this is not a game for everyone even though I'd recommend it to everyone to try it. Consider trying it if you like card games (but be aware it's not a typical deck building game), if you like puzzle games (because the mastery comes from constantly considering how to put the pieces together so they work), or if you want to try a great and different take on rougelikes.", "timestamp_created": 1606490169, "timestamp_updated": 1614784112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814432799816131592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61999527": {"recommendationid": "61999527", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996694272", "num_games_owned": 784, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 9432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7950, "last_played": 1641719047}, "language": "english", "review": "First published in 2008, the board game \"Dominion\" by Donald X. Vaccarino came to spawn the \"deck-building\" genre of board games. In it, the players around a table each start with humble, identical decks for their small kingdoms and gradually transform them into rich empires. Doing so requires acquiring new cards throughout the game which are added to the discard pile and cycled back into the deck when the draw pile runs out.\n\nSlay the Spire is a descendant of this game, but seems to draw more inspiration from an earlier piece of Vaccarino's work, \"Spirit Warriors\" - a game where you are building up a hero and using their attack and defense cards to defeat enemies. Vaccarino would eventually find the RPG aspects too cumbersome and cut away the fiddly monsters, quests and damage. In its place \"Dominion\" was a game about kingdom building through acquiring land and economic assets.\n\nThanks to the advantages of being a video game, the ideas of battling monsters which were too cumbersome to put into a board game now shine bright and tantalizing in Slay the Spire. A host of monsters, treasures, special events, and a simplified card-loot system bring all the strengths of a traditional dungeon crawl to the genre in a way that other deck-building board games like Thunderstone and Ascension couldn't.\n\nTo say that Slay the Spire is a good game is an understatement. Much as Dominion before it, Slay the Spire has been an absolutely fundamental game in the creation of a whole new genre. Once you've seen it on Steam, you'll soon be shown a dozen or more games running with the same ideas.

Information from those who have taken this game to bed and had pillow talk and a cigarette with it.\n\nYou want rogue-like? you got it, buddy. That sweet, sweet RNG will come back and haunt your dreams, It'll make your bed sheets feel cold when you neglect it. When those cards don't draw like you want them to, you'll draw your covers up over your head at night and wonder about the great what-ifs. \n\nYou want deck-building? You'll be rewarded for having a Small Deck. You will constantly feel self-conscious about how big and thick your deck is. Are other players' decks this big? Should mine be smaller? Will my deck satisfy the boss? These are all important questions you should be asking yourself. The answer to these questions is no, your deck is too big, and your deck will never satisfy the boss. You'll chase the dragon of beating the final Boss on ascension 20 in your dreams. That boss will laugh at your deck and wonder why you showed up. You either cower in shame or rise to the occasion. You'll take every rejection as a challenge. Each boss that mocks your deck will pay, eventually, with a thorough thrashing and a set of tea in their chambers. \n\nYou want to know who Neow is? You want to know the origin story? Nice. Get the heck out. Neow doesn't need your patronage. Neow is all knowing. Neow and the Spire sleep in the same bed at night. Neow and the Spire talk about your sad, sad decks that you have presented in the past and laugh. It's your job to make them wish they'd held their wagging tongues.\n\nBut you will never quit. You will always want to seek that perfect deck that will someday satisfy the Spire. It will someday let the Heart rest, finally being satisfied after a good beating.\n\nYou could be the one to lay the Spire's heart to rest. Is your deck good enough to do so?\n\nProbably not.
