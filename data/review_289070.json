Unfortunately, I couldn't quite even get to the 100 hour mark with this game in the 6+ years I've owned it and found myself going back to Civ 5 even to this day.\n\nThe game improves a lot in the features from Civ 5, allowing more ways run your civilization with the unit improvements such as allowing attachment of civilian unites to military ones to protect them as well as allowing districts so that a city that was started surrounded by land could still access the ocean if it was at least a few tiles away.  But even with all of these improvements, I couldn't get over a lot of the aesthetic choices they went with this game.  The cartoony and exaggerated expressions from the Civ leaders and units didn't really click with me and kind of made the experience feel more cheap as compared to the more realistic and compelling aesthetic that Civ 5 had.  I also did not like the change of workers expiring after improving a certain amount of tiles whereas 5 kept your workers to continually improve.\n\nThe agenda system also does dampen the experience a little for me as well as I often found leaders despising me just because I wouldn't fit what they prefer, such as lacking in culture.  I'm sure others would find this setting interesting as it adds another dynamic in relations, but I found it very annoying as it didn't make a lot of sense to ruin relations just because my empire wasn't progressing in a way that the AI thought suitable.\n\nIt may be a fit unfair with how much I do compare this game to Civ 5, but it is hard not to given this was the next step taken in the series.  Given how I hold Civ 5 in such high regard and how much of a let down this game was in comparison, I honestly cannot recommend it to others.  If you did not like Civ 5, this game might be a good change of pace to get into.

That keeps you going on for just one more turn.\n\nOnce you actually defeat your neighbours and take their cities, what was previously all consuming is no longer important. If anything, it's more effort as you now need to micromanage even more things. With more of the map revealed there is less mystery and wonder, and the modern era turns into a slog to complete whatever victory condition you're aiming for.\n\nI think I'm going to stop now after only losing 50 hours of my life.

I tried it again now, years later, to see if my opinion has changed (or perhaps updates had improved it) but no dice.\n\nThis game has made the misguided DLC features that were added to Civ 5 as core game elements. I know what the developers were trying to do and why but they went about it the wrong way. A Civ game should be about the player making large strategic decisions, and while one could decide to micromanage a little, mostly by allocation of civilians at cities, it was generally easy to ignore most of that and focus your attention on your borders and military forces, making appropriate diplomatic and militaristic decisions to keep your people happy.\n\nCiv 6 takes thing the opposite direction. It forces the player to spend an inordinate amount of time micromanaging their empire for very little benefit. The developers didn't need to hyper-focus on trade, religion, and tourism; these elements were already represented in much simpler and abstract way. Now I am arranging artwork in museums, constantly telling traders which cities to go to, and dealing with a constant influx of missionaries that flood over the borders of my empire.\n\nCiv needed new, bold ideas to describe different aspects of a culture and then gamify them, not a bunch of new specialty units and micro-games for a player to juggle and eat up their time.\n\nI do like some of the new aspects of city building. It was a clever way to add more customization. However, the overall general happiness system is removed and replaced with a more complicated amenities and housing system that doesn't really add anything to the game - just another tedious things to manage. I already have to worry about feeding cities to grow their population - now I have to worry about making them homes to? Will a future update or game add a plumber unit I need to order about to unclog drains?\n\nOn the plus side, they got Sean Bean to narrate.

While not as good as Civ 5 it does add some improvements. I do like how buildings are broken up into district tiles and builders are consumable, which makes you think more about how you are going to use them as opposed to putting them on auto pilot like in previous games. The fact that you can't construct roads beyond making trade routes and the fact that they will often times choose sea routes over land when you want to build roads between cities is a pain. In the future it would be nice to see if they can flesh out districts and potentially allow for districts to produce units/buildings separately from your city center.

Do you remember this? [/h1]\n\nFirst at all Civilization VI looks very good compared to older Civs. For me it's not important to catch the best graphics in these kind of games. But if you want a good looking game too than Civ VI is a good option. \nBut back to the important stuff the gameplay. With the new district system the developer find a new way to improve the game in a good way. First it's a bit strange compared to older Civs, because now you can't build everything in your city without caring about what you build. The new districts have to build on fields around your city. The same applies for the wonders now. There is also a population limit for the districts. So you have to be more strategical to deside what kind of city you want. I really like that improvement. You can specialize your cities and have to deside carefully. Feels different but in a good way. Same i can say about city-states. There are now city-states that improve your districts and come with different buffs if you hold the most envoys. For example you could build a special field improvement etc. That also makes the city-states more important for you. \nWell the AI is still not the best, but it's getting better.\nAnother thing that works still good in Civ VI is the way you could win this game. War is not the only option to win. With the district and the city-state system that works in my opinion much better.\n\nBut there are also a few things i dont like. For example the loadtime of the rounds in late game took very long. I personally like to play on big maps with many countries... There are options to reduce this, but this works in my opinion not very good. I couldn't see much changes here. Well it's still much better compared to Humankind, but still a problem.\nI'm also not a fan of the most scenarios they bring out. Feels a bit like they rename units, change some mechanics and that's all. I miss scenarios like the world war or future scenario in Civ IV, where they add new units and buildings. I also would like to see more unit options in late game. Everyone runs the same units. I know it wasn't much better in Civ IV and V, but maybe they could change that in VII. On the other hand there are mods too.\nThere are some options to improve you gameplay too. For example you could choose extra mods for your normal gameplay like stronger environmental disasters and many more. That adds another reason to replay.\nAnd like always i really love the quotes.

In that difficulty it's all about going with a strategy and optimizing your decisions, setting things up and thinking turns ahead. The game itself is easy in the sense, because if you are not conquered by the AI in the first 30 turns due to unfortunate map, then you will most likely win the game if you know its rules. If you are into being a smarty strategist and you enjoy planning and seeing it work out (or completely botched by barbarians) then it's your game.\n\nThe game is very well made in its fundamentals, however, victory types could have been polished. For example if you're going for a religious victory you will not need at least 1/3rd of the technology tree and will stick with Theocracy, an earlier than mid game policy for the rest of the game. Other than this the replayability rate is tremendous due to randomly generated maps and the number of playable leaders and victory types.\n\nAlso the game has an uplifting atmosphere due to its music, great leaders and the numerous interesting quotes read by Sean Bean.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1689339279, "timestamp_updated": 1689339279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638343513011932373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136931319": {"recommendationid": "136931319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271837241", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 4184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1260, "last_played": 1684160663}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR The game is addicting but all of the win conditions feel empty and generally uninteresting to progress.

After a while you'll start learning what few government policies that are actually worth looking at and the few important strategic resources worth hoarding.\n\nThe game has 4 (technically 5) different Victory conditions and honestly none is particularly well designed. Religion is so OP, brain-dead and fast that i easily got my first win with it despite not knowing what I was doing. Culture is slow and exceptionally tedious forcing you to micro-manage a bunch of units late game, I assume because the devs thought more APM = more Depth. Both of these conditions have the same problem where they don't have any progression at all past round 50. Once your Religion is established and apostles unlocked circa round 50 religious gameplay remains the same for the next 300-500 turns.\n\nScience is technically the same as Religion and Culture where the strategy is just build as many fully maxed out building X while supplementing with the X government but it ends up 100x more enjoyable because it doesn't force you to brainlessly micro-manage 15 different units. Letting you play with all the things on the tech tree also helps Science games not feel like a drag. Certainly better than Culture and Religion but not great.\n\nDomination is by far the most interesting wincon, as its the only one that actually has any real substantial progression. Which is a shame because the game does everything in its power to make a domination victory the most difficult and tedious experience possible. The game rewards slow deliberate capture of territory over 100s of turns and makes extended combat a net negative for everyone involved. This sounds like a good idea that lets everyone stay in the game while letting an aggressive player slowly get rewarded but in reality 99% of the time it just leads to one nation who got a lucky spawn away from any aggression getting the win because they were allowed to focus 100% on their goal (Whilst you and the guy playing Rome besieging you end the game 1st and 2nd on domination lead while last in everything else.)\n\nHonestly while the games problems aren't easy to ignore I still enjoy it quite a bit. The big thing stopping my recommendation is the mountain of DLC required to get the 'true experience'. The external launcher and looming knowledge that development is finished to focus on CIV 7 is just the nail in the coffin.", "timestamp_created": 1681858583, "timestamp_updated": 1681858583, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638321459293365479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136846456": {"recommendationid": "136846456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355382427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 26018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23260, "last_played": 1691473693}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably my favorite game.

The gist of it, just not as good as Civ 5. There will be a continuous theme that I will try to lay out as I write this: The game either lacks any sense or it does not have any logical sense. Do not get me wrong. The game is fun. I was entertained and hooked for some amount of time but the decisions made in this game are glaring when compared to civ 5. It is sad to see a decline from such a great game.\n\n-DLC are terrible, do not add much value and overly priced. Not really worth your time.\n\n-The whole aesthetics of the game is pretty fortnite-like to me. Civ 5 was also a bit cartoon-ish but it felt way more serious and impactful, you were an actual leader of the world trying to achieve your goals. Civ 6 feels like a circus, everything seems as it is a joke, very cartoon like and magical. Obviously the game is very beautiful and looks superb, the tone is completely off and Firaxis has deviated way too much to please who? After seeing a few interviews, it seems they are trying to get a more whimsical crowd to play the game. Civ 5 is better.\n\n-Graphics in this game are amazing.\n\n-Early game civilisations > Late game civilisations. I do not know if this is accurate but from what I have seen, being able to snowball early can mean you become unbeatable. Not really balanced. I enjoy this aspect of the game very much but the bonuses each civilisation has are too strong.\n\n-Combat is sincerely unbalanced and very punishing if you do not know the meta. There are so many bloody bonuses from religion, governors, unique traits, etc. I have watched people get +20 combat bonus or more on their units and it seems insane. Forget deity, in multiplayer you can get trashed by a military that is behind scientifically very easily. You have to get these bonuses and know how to get them or you will get trashed in multiplayer. The rock-paper-scissor still works very well in this entry but units are also quite forgettable. Nothing beats England's long bowmen from civ 5 or ship of the line. Combat feels very smooth and easy to understand, even though RNG can be a problem.\n\n-Gameplay is pretty trash. I cannot think of a single mechanic that Civ 6 has improved to Civ 5. I think the only mechanic that was good was spies.\n\n    *Religion is boring and the game play is not entertaining. I do not know anyone who really tries to win through religion. It is awfully tedious. I am the most ignorant about this aspect.\n\n    *You have to place districts and wonders on tiles which restricts your territory and placing these in a certain formation grants you from minor bonuses to massive ones. Why? Because the game developers said so. My gripe is wonders and districts take an entire tile, removing bonuses the land was giving you and giving you an adjacency bonuses if it is next to certain other districts, improvements, resources and wonders. Most of these bonuses in the game make no logical sense, for some civilisations the bonuses can be massive, it restricts your freedom on how you want to build your cities (you can play however you like but the repercussions are huge if you do not optimise your cities) and it causes you to micromanage your cities twice as much as you would in Civ 5. It causes games to prolong way too much, adding several hours to your sessions. Once you get to end game, it is so tedious to continue playing. So many little details which has to be taken into account and no way to automate. I wish I could hire governors to automate cities for me because I really do not want to have to give orders every single turn for mundane stuff. Thankfully there is Shift+Enter to skip all orders and end turn. Age of Wonders has a fantastic mechanic which is, idle cities produce merchandise automatically which gives you bonus gold depending on your production. God, such a simple mechanic and Firaxis cannot even fathom a solution to this. Civ 5 is better just because none of these bonuses exist and wonders are placed automatically in one of your tiles, giving a nice subtle aesthetic look to your cities.\n\n    *I miss being able to automate my workers. Nope, that does not exist here. Micromanage is once again very tedious. I personally sell or kill all my workers after a certain era because it starts becoming more annoying than beneficial. My personal view is they should just remove workers from the game and replace it with a different mechanic. Also workers having 3 charges then disappear is probably the worst mechanic in this game. I would understand if my worker was building the pyramids it would probably die, but a farm? My worker makes 3 farms and it dies? What is the logic behind it? \nAt least make workers not have charges when you reach a certain era or research workers right or something. Probably has to do with balance. Civ 5 is better in every way.\n\n    *Eureka and inspirations are absolute garbage. They force you into playing one way, pigeon hole you into a meta to maximise your research and culture which are extremely important in Civ 6. Basically, you have a checklist of things to do. Not doing this checklist punishes you severely. Do not have iron around? You get punished. Do not want to build spearman and use it to kill a unit? You get punished. No hills to build mines? You get punished. What is the punishment? Research and culture taking more turns to complete. How many turns could you have saved? 40% of the total time which is massive. This system should be scrapped.\n\n    *Great persons is a terribly implemented mechanic because it is a competition on who can generate the most points in the respective field to lure a great person or buy them with gold or faith. This has some logic to it but lets be honest, great persons should never run out and some great people are born into a civilisation just like in Civ 5. In Civ 6, If you cannot compete in anyway you cant have a great person of that field and they run out, which means you need to snag them early or on time. Also each great person has a unique bonus or active ability which can give, once again, massive bonuses which no one else can get. It creates a mini race for great persons. If you do not participate, your opponent will become very powerful. Civ 5 does this way, way better. If they wanted to improve this mechanic, it should be a spy feature like it has happened historically. For instance Albert Einstein or many of the Nazi scientists that were either were smuggled out or captured during world war II to work on several different projects which led the USA to win the space race. The spy feature could be steal scientist if a certain Civilisation has a great person born. There are so many solutions to this yet they went with this dreary silly implementation.\n\n    *Spies in Civ 6 have several cool additions to game play like sabotage production but unfortunately not an important aspect of the game. Spies effectiveness is very low for the amount of effort you need to get them. Stealing art and research can be cool and necessary to win. Reality is once you get spies and promote them so they are efficient, usually the game is almost over or the fate of the game is already sealed. The game can be so quick now, most late game mechanics are not worth getting.\n\n    *Governors are absolute garbage. Another mechanic that adds bonuses that can scale to abusive amounts. Few of the governors suck, not every city can have a governor and promotions can only be received through civics.

What I encountered was downright uncivilized: It's a cartoon mobile game.\n\nHey player, get ready to COOPERATE with your FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS to PROMOTE PEACE and PROGRESS among the people of THE WORLD, so we can SAVE THE PLANET. There's nothing stopping the player from ignoring this tone and playing in the usual competitive, aggressive and imperialist way, but it seems the writers saw a great need to tell you DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS COOL THING IT IS IMMORAL AND BAD. There are few of the highly controversial leaders left in the game - Stalin and Mao are gone, for example - and instead we now have a less eurocentric and more feminine cast of leaders. Sure, it's just a game, but you can see which way the wind is blowing.\n\nSpeaking of the leaders, they have faces. Whoever designed and animated them should be made galley slaves along with the writers. Most of the characters in the game are detestable from their ridiculous proportions and facial expressions alone. I think this might be a generational thing - modern 3D cartoons probably look a lot like this. But let's not beat around the bush. It's aggravatingly ugly and anyone who likes it has no taste. The atmosphere in the game is gone entirely to shit, and whatever sense of historical gravity earlier Civilization games might have held on to is clearly no longer there. Again, sure, it's just a game, but this is a poorer game for it.\n\nYeah, the writing and visual style alone are enough to sink this ship. The gameplay fails to keep it afloat. \nCity-states aren't just single-city civs but a completely separate type of entity. So now you have barbarians, civilizations and city-states, and each has completely different rules and mechanics. You even get quests. Quests! What is this, some shitty RPG? Why yes, yes it is! You even get to level up your city governors, who come in various distinct classes, and give them specialist skills! And the governors are fixed, pre-made fictional characters with names and identities that have nothing whatsoever to do with your civilization but are instead a diverse and colorful cast form around the world! What a joke.\n\nWonders still work on the basis of winner-takes-it-all, and no matter how much of a genre and series staple this is, I never liked it and never will.\n\nUnit movement is a chore. Unit automation isn't up to the job.\n\nCity districts can never be removed, replaced or repositioned, so you'd better know from turn 1 where you plan to place each district, wonder and whatnot. And I'm not being hyperbolic here, the top most-downloaded mods for this game are city planning aides.\n\nThe World Congress is overcomplicated without actually doing much.\n\nThere are too many game mechanics, and all of them are too shallow.\n\nThe UX is often cumbersome, displays too little relevant information, requires too many clicks to get things done, and has inconsistent keyboard shortcuts. The UI is very uninspired and makes very inefficient use of screen real estate.\n\nThe music runs the gamut from inappropriately grandiose to boring to annoying. The soundscape is probably the least impressive in any Civ game I played so far.\n\nCombat animations are often nonsensical.\n\nTooltips are often absent where I'd have wanted them, and the ones that are there offer very limited information.\n\nThe narrator seems strangely angry much of the time.\n\nThe pacing is off; you rush through the tech tree with barely enough time to build one of half the things it unlocks. I guess this is another step taken to make the game more accessible, firstly by shortening overall campaign length and secondly by drowning people in a sense of progress without actually forcing them to get their hands dirty by actively doing something with it.\n\nOne new thing I like is that you can get a leg up on some technologies by performing specific actions related to them. That's somewhat intuitive and fun. So far that's also the only thing I think Civ6 has actually done to improve on the formula.\n\nReally not what I was looking for in a game of Civilization. Yeah I know some of my criticism applies to older entries in the series as well, but that doesn't do this one any favors. Did you know that Civ6 is also shipped on mobile phones? I wasn't joking up there. That's probably one source of many of its problems.\n\nOverall I'd just rather play Civ4, maybe with a good mod, or some other 4X game altogether.", "timestamp_created": 1672770954, "timestamp_updated": 1676534279, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565079867839813232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126810533": {"recommendationid": "126810533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141022269", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1696544784}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, but this review stays until they get Aspyr to fix the mac and Linux version.\nI would't have bought the game if it didn't have Linux support.

It's not necessarily an improvement over civ 5, it is different than civ 5 and does some things better, some things worse.\n\nHere are some of the main new mechanics and my opinion on them:\n\nDistricts: You place these on tiles and they make up most of the buildings you can make in a city. There are two main consequences of this new system. One, it requires significantly more time and effort to play the game in an optimal way since which tiles you place your districts on is very important. While I like this in single player, it makes multiplayer more tedious. Two, it kills \"tall\" builds in a pretty extreme manner. While some people complained civ 5 took its pro-tall approach a bit far, the districts system completely kills tall builds because districts simply have more yields than tiles and they are limited by the number of cities you have. It is also advantageous to place cities close enough to make their districts close to each other for adjacency bonuses. There is also no penalty to making more cities other than settlers getting more expensive as you build more settlers. So there is really only one way to play this game and it's spamming as many cities as possible as close as possible.\n\nCivics: Culture is now like a second type of science. Your culture yields allow you to advance in your civics tree similar to how you use science yields to advance in the science tree. I like this mechanic. It adds more depth to the strategy without being boring or tedious. Civics can be just as important as techs depending on what you are going for so this makes low-science high-culture builds possible, even in multiplayer. You'll still want to catch up in science at some point but prioritizing culture over science is a valid strategy. Overall, pretty good mechanic.\n\nPolicies: These are kind of part of the new civics system but also a separate mechanic. Civics unlock policies and government types and you can run a certain number of policies based on your government type. This mechanic can feel a bit overwhelming and tedious at first but after a few hundred hours of play, I started liking this mechanic too. It is also something that adds strategic depth to the game.\n\nLoyalty: This is essentially a mechanic they invented to stop extreme forward settling and I really like the idea, although there are some issues with implementation. The population of your cities emanate an aura of loyalty to your civilization and if you settle a city far away from your civilization and close to an enemy civilization who has a lot of high-pop cities nearby, that city will flip to the enemy civ. While this mostly works well, it can feel really dumb on congested starts on deity difficulty where your capital can start losing loyalty already in the very first few turns. They probably should have made the capital have higher defensive pressure or something along those lines.\n\nOther than the new mechanics, compared to civ 5, I think the new art style is significantly worse and in addition, they seem to have followed \"diversity\" quotas when choosing the leaders. There are some female leaders who weren't of any real historical relevance.\n\nThe soundtrack is great. It might even be better than the civ 5 soundtrack.\n\nOverall, it's a decent game which has some advantages and disadvantages compared to civ 5. It's probably worth a try, especially on sale.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1695987170, "timestamp_updated": 1695987689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282048225402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130162905": {"recommendationid": "130162905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093540006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1787, "last_played": 1678860730}, "language": "english", "review": "Horseshit, play Civ V instead", "timestamp_created": 1672893967, "timestamp_updated": 1672893967, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551182746887207031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125769702": {"recommendationid": "125769702", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962383727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 59118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45697, "last_played": 1690853343}, "language": "english", "review": "Could've sworn I wrote a negative review on this before that appears to have magically disappeared.\n\nIt's fun, but incredibly buggy.

It is a perfect continuation of the series and has many new features and gameplay elements that make it even more exciting to play.\n\nNew features include, for example, the districts, which allow each city to be customised and improved, and the introduction of city states as playable factions. The improved diplomacy system and the ability to create wonders on different areas also contribute to the deeper immersion of the game.\n\nCivilization VI also has stunning graphics and soundtrack that bring the game's world to life. The AI enemies are more challenging and smarter than in previous games in the series.\n\nI think that playing Civilization VI is a must for any fan of strategy games. It is a game that provides hours of fun and always offers new challenges.\n\n\n5", "timestamp_created": 1677345942, "timestamp_updated": 1683004341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131188336": {"recommendationid": "131188336", "author": {"steamid": "76561199470895371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1419, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1696224663}, "language": "english", "review": "Civ Vi is a fantastic and addictive game, but I have the misfortune of trying to play it on a Mac.

I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who liked Civ V, and also to everyone who likes 4X games like stellaris or anno. \nHonestly i would say every aspect of the game compared to civ V has improved and the additions feel very well made. The district system is super fun and the maps feel a lot more alive with the disasters and different district bonuses, which really makes you think about where to put your cities/districts. Also, a wide gameplay is more viable (and even the meta as far as i know), which makes wars and aggressive expansion more common compared to the tall and more (somtimes boring) economy focused gameplay of Civ V (or at least that's how i and my friends played it).\nA little mod suggestion from me: i would recommend getting the mods \"historic speed\" and \"Civ6 Plus: Harmony in Diversity\". I found that this combination makes the tall gameplay a little bit stronger than in the base game, while still leaving wide very competetive.

I prefer the 5 version workers which I could set on auto when I got too big to care and prefer the old movement system. Plus, once again, a TON of Civs are locked behind DLC along with game modes. I may play another round at some point just for a different challenge, but this honestly just feels like a new, different looking DLC to 5 where the game rules have changed a little and they expect you to re-buy everything.\n\nAll that being said, if you're new to the Civ series, check out both 5 and 6 on the store and only buy ONE of them.

One of my favorite aspects of the game is the ability to choose from a wide variety of civilizations, each with their own unique abilities and bonus. This adds a lot of replay value to the game as you can try out different strategies and playstyles with each civilization.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that I really enjoy is the tech tree. It is very detailed and allows players to unlock new technologies and abilities as they progress through the game. The tech tree also ties in nicely with the game's victory conditions, as certain technologies are necessary to achieve certain types of victory (such as a cultural victory).\n\nOne of the things that I appreciate about Civilization VI is the attention to detail in the game's graphics and soundtrack. The landscapes are beautiful and the unit and building models are highly detailed. The soundtrack is also fantastic, with a sweeping score that perfectly captures the grandeur of building an empire. The game's graphics are stunning, with beautiful landscapes and detailed unit and building models.

Laugh at ME, actually, for being stupid enough to fall for the corrupt overhype that is the current state of PC gaming reviews, particularly the reviews that support the criminality of the advertising behind this charade.\n\nI say corrupt, and I do mean exactly that, because there are only two possible scenarios  that would result in this game getting anywhere near a less than shitty review from any sentient being in the cosmos. The first scenario is that the over 100,000 positive reviewers, AND the handful of raving triple A game review sites, have never played ANY strategy game before, much less a CIV game , and are issuing these positive reviews based on their apparent lack of exposure to any properly programmed PC game in the past. I know this scenario to be implausible, and nigh on impossible.\n\nThe second , and more disturbing scenario, is that the positive reviews are simply faked by bots or ( shudder) paid writers whose honesty is non-existent. No truthful customer who bought this game could EVER say that it is well programmed, improved, or better balanced than a drunken three-legged hippo on rollerskates going down a set of broken stairs in the dark.\n\nThe programming, writing, game mechanics and most importantly game balance are insulting to anyone paying for this nonsense. Not only is this childish trope aimed at the 13-15 year old crowd, it appears to be written and programmed by that  dysfunctional demographic as well. You can literally park a few army units next to a barbarian camp and watch that camp generate 5 armed units per turn., each with mystical powers of invisibility and fast travel better suited to Harry Potter and the Horde of Bot Reviewers.\n\nUtter garbage, and possibly responsible for the very real  demise of my faith in gaming humanity.\nThis is literally the worst ever in terms of game design.

The game is in a state of no updates/patches since 1,5 years(all the \"updates\" are there for more DLC\u00b4s which broke the game even more) and there are some gamebreaking bugs if you have all DLC\u00b4s. For example: if you play with the corporate mode on, the AI will stop improving luxury goods. This breaks the AI completely, i had games with 5 of 6 civs having ZERO military. \n\nTalking about the AI... it is as stupid as you can imagine, they there absolutely lazy with programming it. The AI has even problems fighting barbarian encampments, in one game i got 4 settlers for free because they got stolen from the AI and pretty much handed to me by the barbarians. Seeing your enemy land being pillaged and burned for centuries is an regular encounter...\n\nYou would think: if the AI is so bad, just play against other players. Welcome to multiplayer hell of civ 6. Desyncs, crashes, bugs.\n\nStay away from this game, they try to milk their costumers with the \"free dlc\" even more and do not care a dime about the game and all the things that are still wrong with it after 6 years.

Everybody's been getting crashes mostly of their stupid 2K launcher that does nothing but show you ads and news for other games, and crashes and other issues with the gathering storm DLC. Firaxis does not care. To my knowledge they haven't even acknowledged it as an issue, despite huge community outcry. Also, all the DLC leaders are overpriced. I should not be paying $7 for portugal individually. Greedy and uncaring BS, and I only put up with it because I'm a fan of the series. \n\nNeglect and greed aside, this is a half-decent game. Coming from V, they really tried to flesh the game out. Things feel a bit more zoomed in with districts and a few systems that have been reworked or added, and that's not particularly a bad thing. The aesthetic takes a little bit of getting used to, but looks great. The AI is slightly smarter than it was in Civ V which is nice, but they don't do anything too crazy. Generally, everything just plays well. Early game is great, mid-game is great, late-game is great but still suffers from the standard \"ugh just have to get through this last stretch even though I know I/they are going to win in 60 turns\" that other civ games did. \n\nIt's fine. It has issues here n' there, but it's a decent civ game. If you plan on playing singleplayer or if you can wrangle your friends into playing with you,  I'd recommend Civ V complete edition over this.

You gradually progress through the ages by researching technology, developing \nculture, and building specialty districts.  You must balance relations with other nations while also keeping your goals in mind: to make your nation the best nation.  \n\nFirst off, let me clarify that Civilization VI meets the expectations.  Overall, it's a good game and I think most people would enjoy playing it.  However, there are multiple problems I would like to address.  First, the paywall.  After playing the game for a bit, it started to feel like there was not much content to the game. It felt like I bought a bit of the game for $60, and am now suppose to buy the rest of the game (DLC) for $150.  The game does not feel complete.  I STRONGLY encourage any future purchasers to wait for a sale.  Currently, the steam summer sale is live and the whole bundle is something like 81% off.  Wait for a sale and get the game AND all the DLC for less than the base game costs regularly.\n\nSecondly, I question the quality of the DLC.  Before I get into this, please know I have not bought or played DLC at this time.  Looking at the reviews for the DLC, the vast majority are either \"mixed reviews\" or \"mostly negative.\"  This is concerning for me.  These negative review have me very hesitant to go and buy the rest of the game, and you may want to look over the reviews and decide for yourself if it is worth buying.  \n\nOverall, my only complaints are with the DLC.  The base game is of a high-caliber and is well produced.  If you like Civilization games, this is another success.  Please just wait for a sale...\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688179872, "timestamp_updated": 1688179872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125895091": {"recommendationid": "125895091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958541956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2539, "last_played": 1668535981}, "language": "english", "review": "Best \"play 4 hours to then crash and lose all ur fucking progress simulator (twice)\" on the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnow fr just keep ur goddamn money, trust me.", "timestamp_created": 1669063508, "timestamp_updated": 1669063508, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127784707": {"recommendationid": "127784707", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963143781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 339, "playtime_at_review": 3339, "last_played": 1696491591}, "language": "english", "review": "Game crashes every other turn after 200 turns.", "timestamp_created": 1670009794, "timestamp_updated": 1670009794, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526259362697601318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141066598": {"recommendationid": "141066598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156861705", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1684078226}, "language": "english", "review": "Man this game stinks, go play CIV 5 instead", "timestamp_created": 1688231981, "timestamp_updated": 1688231981, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526231229305267334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125680423": {"recommendationid": "125680423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180553779", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1694353523}, "language": "english", "review": "Hella addictive for players who just want a slow pace/ turn based game", "timestamp_created": 1668768629, "timestamp_updated": 1668768629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526066362857818604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142381970": {"recommendationid": "142381970", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091982530", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 665, "playtime_at_review": 16607, "last_played": 1696291422}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the most addictive game I've ever played.

I even remember going \"Civ 6? Yuck. I guess I can just install it when I'm bored and see what it's like compared to Civilization V\".\n\nWell, I installed it 3 days ago to see how that idea would go and I just uninstalled it yesterday - never playing this again.\n\nI definitely agree with most of the reviewers that Civilization 5 is far superior than this version of Civilization 6. I just don't understand how a company like Fireaxis could get so many things wrong WHEN THEY HAVE PRIOR GAMES AND SEQUELS TO REFERENCE!\n\nNow to the nitty gritty - Here's a list of my frustrations:\n\n[list]\n    [*] I love the new characters - can't stand the artwork style choice - I understand trying to make it more of a cartoon to reach a wider audience - but now it's just like \"Clash of Clans\" or \"Boom Beach\" - the artwork actually hurts my eyes with how utterly shit it looks -_-\n\n    [*] Give us a way to disable the World Congress (without editing files or grabbing mods) - it was much more manageable in Civ 5 and actually made sense - the way it is used in this iteration seems like it's to camouflage the lack of content or lack of new ideas from Civ 5. It's even more apparent with the fact the World Congress gets called almost every other screen frame update...\n\n           [*] Additionally, the World Congress used to ONLY be started by a player/bot that initiates it (from what I understand in Civ 5) AND it reveals all the other players/empires in the game. This version just spontaneously starts right after meeting 1 civilization and everyone is wearing a cloak over their heads - definitely engaging...\n\n    [*] The repetitive random dialog interactions from bot players is beyond obnoxious - it's almost as frequent as World Congress votes. I move one unit, bot brings me to a splash screen to interrupt what I'm doing - okay, cool, exit from the dialog and continue on. not even 2 minutes later, the same bot (or a new bot) engages with the same dialog from 2 minutes ago - okay, that's a bit annoying, but it's not a big deal, let's move on. Then it happens a third time, a fourth time, and then a fifth time - I'm not even talking the initial engagement dialogs when you FIRST meet a new civilization - Civilization 5 wasn't THAT obnoxious - this game though, this is just lazy developers riding the brand name and flaunting their shit artwork design.\n\n    [*] The lack of automated workers and how they have \"limited improvement uses\" - this one bothered the hell out of me for a good portion of the short matches I played - my Civilization 5 strategy was to just train a worker, then send them off to do automated improvements and not worry about them (unless they were kidnapped by barbarians or another civilization). I can't really tell what game balancing the developers were attempting to achieve by not making them automated and giving them limited uses. Like, did a developer from Civilization 6 look at Civilization 5 and go \"we need to change AT LEAST one mechanic to make this Civilization game more unique. But what exactly do we change? AHA we'll make the workers manual AND give them limited uses. INGENIOUS\". I don't know, I'm just lobbing as much shit at this game for how bad it is.\n\n    [*] Governors are just an awful mechanic, they don't really do much of anything - what's the point of them?\n[/list]\n\nAnd here's a short list of the somewhat \"good\" ideas:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Biome/region specific wonders - pretty cool concept - requires the player actually start a city on a spot to be allowed to build the wonder - the old way was still funnier when America could just randomly build the Pyramid of Giza or the Eiffel Tower.

Or spend about 30 turns to get a domination victory ?\nThose last turns really just feel like a waste of time. \nYou constantly go through the same things. The same buildpath. There is nothing interesting about it.\n\nI come from playing games like Age of Empires 2.\nThe interesting thing about it is that... If I spend my resources on Feudal age units... I'll likely stay stuck in fuedal age long and thus I'll be fighting with my Feudal age units for a longer time. It's a hard decision, but also fun.\n\nWith Civ6...

If you are reading this, You must already know how 4X in Sid Meier's Civ working already. So let me cut to the chase and telling you the factors on to have or not to have this game.\n\n- In Vanilla standard main game. The game is best on its own self. Beautiful UI, Very Board game-ish graphic.\n- The game this time, required you to planning your own tile. Every districts and every special building even the wonders now will require a tile of its own. So you can't just built without having a proper accommodation for them.\n- The builder will also being reduce each time you are using the for each construction, However, The construction will be immediate and doesn't require you to waiting it out.\n- The culture  point will now being assign for culture development which will affecting you more in a way of progressing your culture for certain victory.\n\nIn overall, Even just Vanilla game. You will already having enough fun to last until you are bored with the game. But you can also purchasing more expansion to added more flavor to the gameplay. But be warn, the expansion will changing the way you play each match very drastically.\n\nGathering storm will adding the \"Disaster\" system into the game. As you are progressing through the game depending you your style or the opponents. The map will generate a \"Disasters\" based on the condition of your region and \"World's temp level\" If you or other players using the construction that wasn't \"Eco - Friendly\" You are going to have a risen sea level and a flood. Or other occurance such as Volcano or river flood. All and all will affect your playthrough in a way. Quite a fun additiion if you want to feel the world corresponding to your action.\n\nRise & Fall: Either love it or hate it. This one will added Governor system and the Influence system. Simply put, The placement of each cities can now affecting the \"influence\" of leader and culture on each cities. If your city got surrounding by other leader's city and will your you own city around the vicinities. That little city of your will be influence by other culture causing it to rebel. And no, Not the same Rebel in Civ V with just \"Babarian units\" spawning on that city. But you will also losing that city. Which will open for other player to taking it over.\n\nThe issue  of losing your city can be counter with placing the governors into the city. But still, Its very annoyance since this will restrict your liberty to settling anywhere since you'll have to baby sit that little city until its strong enough and not being influenced by other civilization.\n\nEach expansion will also adding the new leaders which same as usual on hit and miss the mark. But I'm still have to say that their design look very pleasant in cartoonish way.\n\n\nOverall. I recommended you to play this game and for maximum experience, Buy the complete version.

With its deep gameplay mechanics, expansive scope, and engaging historical theme, it stands as the epitome of strategic empire building.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of Civilization VI lies in its depth and complexity. From the very beginning, you're tasked with guiding a fledgling civilization through the ages, making crucial decisions on technology, culture, diplomacy, and warfare. The game's mechanics are intuitive and robust, offering a wealth of strategic options that allow you to shape your civilization's destiny.\n\nThe attention to detail in Civilization VI is commendable. Each leader and civilization is intricately designed, with unique abilities, units, and bonuses that reflect their historical characteristics. The game's art style is vibrant and visually appealing, bringing the world to life with its colorful landscapes and well-crafted animations.\n\nThe diplomacy system in Civilization VI adds another layer of depth to the gameplay. Negotiating with other leaders, forming alliances, and navigating through geopolitical challenges requires careful consideration and decision-making. The introduction of agendas and hidden agendas for each leader makes diplomacy even more dynamic and unpredictable, adding a layer of intrigue to your interactions.\n\nCivilization VI also excels in its replayability. With multiple victory conditions, different leaders to play as, and a wide range of strategies to employ, each playthrough offers a unique experience. The inclusion of expansions and DLCs further enhances the game, introducing new civilizations, mechanics, and scenarios that expand the game's longevity.\n\nThe multiplayer mode in Civilization VI is also a standout feature. Whether competing or cooperating with friends, engaging in epic battles or negotiating alliances, the multiplayer experience is robust and allows for engaging and strategic gameplay sessions.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the game has a relatively steep learning curve. Newcomers to the series might feel overwhelmed by the complexity of mechanics and systems at first.

You'll lose a few games in the beginning, but after a while, you'll find your own way of making the game work in your favor. In fact, Civilization VI is one of the few games that when you lose, you respect it. This game is profound in strategy, tactics, and other fancy military philosophy terms.\nYou can build all sorts of World Wonders. You learn how to strategically zone your city so you can build your wealth and prosperity and defend it from foreign aggressors. You can play dirty with spies and all sorts of political shenanigans. You can go to war, betray your friends, or you can make other players regret going to war with you, and help your friends keep up with the advancements of the game. You can explore the map, make fun of the United Nations, fight Barbarians(or turn them into your people). Ultimately, your task is to build a civilization that stands the test of time. Also, you can look at your hard-earned empire on screen and exhale. Such great feelings.\n\n\nWhat I love about Civ VI is that it made military combat much more accessible for me. Age of Empires is always too fast, Total War is always too awkward with camera angles, Europa Universalis IV is always \"too many things happen at once\", and Civilization's turn-based combat is perfect. Not that is easier, but a tad more accessible. Plus it looks quite corny on screen.\n\nCivilization VI got a very good PS4 - esque visual. This means you don't need a super expensive machine to play it, and it still looks good regardless of the graphical advancement race out there. However, Civilization VI does suffer from other lags, stuttering, and bugs on a multiplayer scale with more than 4 players.\n\nThe soundtrack and music collection in this game is sublime! You can throw any fancy compliments at it and it's still not enough. From modernized folk music to classical songs made atomic, each session of the game surely made you a more worldly person, in terms of audio taste.\n\nThe price is neither cheap nor expensive. I think it's just right. You should buy it in sale and be happy.\n\nIf you're familiar with Civilization V, then Civilization VI is actually a great return to the original Civilization philosophy(Civ V was great, but also a bit outlandish). Both games are great, and that's the reason why Civlization VI should be in your library.\n\nTo new Civilization players(or IV and III players), it's great. It's everything you ever dreamed of a board game can be: entertaining and profound at the same time. It's addictive, comical, and ultimately, a good game.\n\nOne more turn, Se\u00f1or!", "timestamp_created": 1675599040, "timestamp_updated": 1675599040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132252527": {"recommendationid": "132252527", "author": {"steamid": "76561199107619993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 137621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 419, "playtime_at_review": 89409, "last_played": 1696535854}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1675597350, "timestamp_updated": 1675597350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132240296": {"recommendationid": "132240296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007359613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 100439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89215, "last_played": 1693746942}, "language": "english", "review": "The 2K Launcher is a P.O.S that will absolutely fail to run and outright prevent you from being able to play the game.

The game is incredibly detailed but easy to learn, providing enough challenge to keep things interesting but still fun. The game includes lots of historical elements, and the True Start maps allow you to relive history (or change it) if you so choose. Once you get to the point where you really know what your doing, you can start combining abilities and strategies to really take control of the game. I absolutely love this game.

I am playing the series back from Civilization 2 in mid 90's, probably one of the games I played most. I probably have played every official and inofficial map and scenario found on the web. Unfortunately with the latter games, I slowly began to draw futher away from the series. Therefore I hesitated to buy this one. \n\nUnfortunately the initial experience so far confirmed my concerns. Well, the game balance may be good, but there are some very negative things I cannot understand how they did this way:\n1- There are so few amounts of civilizations. They brought some with expansion packs, but as far as I can see you cannot put them in the same pool with regular game. \n2- The game maps are extremely small. Even the largest map is too small. I liked this game by building at least 8-10 cities. I remember going up to 20+ cities in Civ2. Here, literally it is a challenge to find a spot for your third city. I select huge map, make less AI players so that I can have some land to build a civ. Still too much filled, or too small in other words. \n3- AI settles some dumb places without connection to his home, without a chance of connection. It feels like they just turned the gameplay into a board game mechanic, with powerplay, without making any sene to build a \"border\". And it does not feel fun. Sorry.\n4- Where you start the game changes a lot.\n5- Barbarians are stupidly strong and effective in early game. \n6- It was always boring in early game a lot of turn changes until you get some good units, but with barbarians pillaging everything and you waiting for 10 turns to build a warrior to stand of their horse archers (???) feels boring.\n7- If you want to expand from a center to borders, have division of countries like the real world, this game does not allow it. You must settle wherever you can find\n\nI'm not sure how this game got so good critics, but it was a disappointment so far for me.

It will either come out (usually in the early game) and annihilate you with overwhelming force. OR it will not put up a fight AT ALL (especially in the late game). The AI may have a lot of units but it will just sit down and look at you helplessly as you destroy it.\n\nIt's so frustrating to put in so many hours building up an empire and then when you go to war the AI mechanics are terrible. Gone are the days when I would enjoy going to war in Civ, strategizing around choke points, trying to get an advantage with a certain technology or catching up to the others. It's all totally pointless now because eventually when you do go to war there will be no fun out of it.\n\nI tried so much to tweak this problem through difficulty levels to no avail.

It also adds extra complexity to things which is a mixed bag.\n\nFor those who don't know, Civilization is a series where you take some real world civilization like Egyptians, English or Chinese, and go trough from ancient to near future times while building cities, massive world wonders, and units that fight wars. Civilization V saw some numerous changes that pushed the game into allowing more varied victories, using hexagons instead of square tiles, and embracing subtly more boardgamey approach to mechanics. Here these mechancis get expanded on with some complexities, some hard to grasp, others apparently but involved, others much needed.\n\nFor once, the cities, staples of the series that previously always took up one tile on map, now spread out further over the world, with special districts like industrial or academic whose function is clear, and there is a lot of interactions between world and these districts now, like banding them together gives you bonuses, but also placing certain ones by environmental details will also provide bonus, like trade hubs by rivers or science districts by mountains or jungles. The world wonders are also placed on their own tile now, which means spamming wonders in single city is less viable now, plus you may need to sacrifice something else for that wonder sometimes - and also you need some real specific conditions sometimes - like snow, mountain or desert tiles. It feels a bit borrowed from Endless Legend city districts but it's also a major improvement.\n\nThe major focus of this version was to, unlike CivV, make all victory paths fun and deep from get go. It's not just warfare that has some tactical options, now religious and other units have upgrades and varied effects too, culture features artworks and historic artifacts you collect in varied ways, things like trade are integrated so you could harness them to spread religion. Ultimately it still boils down to having developed cities but so does warfare, so why not? Another cool bit that got built up on are city states, now there's a system where you expand a special \"envoy\" resource to get their bonuses, and if you are most invested, their support and special bonus. There's some interesting choices now, whether you want more smaller bonuses from most city states, or focus on several, or go all in building wonders and securing other means to improve your soft power.\n\nOne problem I can totally identify with this game is that it still can stretch out needlessly as with previous games, say tourism victory with several developed nations may get lengthy, but also there's some fiddly unit management trying to drag them around a continent still there, but also now some mechanics like beauty really lack in indication or clarity without hitting the wiki. These small nuances which actually matter a lot, and yet you don't get proper clarity ingame. Another thing is art style, it has some nice bits, some meh bits like how leaders range from cool to mobile game mascots (Please Civ, embrace some art style other than cartoony caricatures for your leaders already), but also while there was some intention of making it clear it just nontheless feels super noisy as you build up your cities or have a lot going on, takes time to grok the going ones.\n\nOverall it's a legit worthwhile game, if you like more ambitious strategy games, 4X or grand strategy in particular, really consider getting this a try, the full package goes on sale for a good price.", "timestamp_created": 1678059545, "timestamp_updated": 1678059545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133672109": {"recommendationid": "133672109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018653369", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15939, "last_played": 1684134964}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically multiplayer is windows only feature as mac is always versions behind windows and there is basically no crossplatform support.\n\n--\nEdit: After waiting some months, it seems that both Windows and Mac Versions are finally same build number.

I go to load a game and it throws an exception and will not play any more.  I have searched for solutions and the only thing that works is uninstalling/reinstalling - then the existing saves load fine again.\n\nSecondly, there are better games in the Civilisation Series.\n\nAnd Third, key features in this one are simply broken.\n\nIt is a shame because I was looking forward to playing Civ6, and will probably still waste countless hours on it.  I did intend to buy on release.  Then I decided as an expensive game, I'd wait for the DLC's to be released - I have been burned before where it's ended up cheaper to just buy the whole thing again than it is to add the DLC later...  One thing led to another and I didn't end up buying until a recent sale.  Sadly despite many years, the kinks haven't been worked out.  Bright flashy animations do not make a Civlisation Game for me.  Gameplay is key and if that is good, it could be pixel art and would still be enjoyable.  Too many aspects of the Gameplay don't work.\n\nMy first play through had a very poor start.  Caught up with barbarians around my first city and by the time I really got going, I lacked room to expand due to more advanced nations nearby.  Frederick Barbosa decides to declare a surprise war and I realise I'm stuffed - there's simply no way my archers can stand up to his advanced cavalry units.  This is when I find out the AI can't do war...  He brings his TWO cavalry units to my capital and moves them around in circles waiting for me to bring them down with my city walls.  They didn't even attack!  At a certain point he just parks one in range of two of my cities until they are dead.  After that, he just didn't do anything, he had no more units.  So I sat my archers outside his nearest city for something like 50 turns bringing it's health down before capturing it with a horseman - and he goes whinging to the world congress!\n\nNow that's another system that is completely broken.  My next playthrough I'm placed too close to my nearest neighbour, I send my warriors down and capture his only city, wiping him out at the start.  I build up my civilisation and have friendly relations with my two nearest neighbours...  Right up until we hit the medieval era.  Suddenly they are not happy that I'm holding the capital city of a civilisation they'd likely never heard of - they gang up and declare war!\n\nI find the World Congress to be a symptom of the game being too self-aware of the fact it is a simulated board game.  It just doesn't find the blend between board game mechanics and developing a civilisation in a single player computer game.  Everything just happens because that's what the game rules dictate and not due to any particular event.  Example - Lets have a vote for which player to give some Victory Points to or whether Settlers should cost more to build...  WHY?  What has happened for us to need to take this decision?  It's a mechanic that might add something if you're playing against other human players - then you can discuss between yourselves and try to convince the others to vote for something that will benefit you, but not when playing against the AI.\n\nThe rest will just be bullet points - and yes some of these are carried over from previous games!\n- Multi-tile cities with districts - I like the city development, but find the cities taking too much space on the map, would like them spread out more - smaller hexes with borders reflecting area of influence and not just city boundaries.\n- Land units can swim?!?  Please stop this.  It defeats the point of building ships when your settlers/explorers can just pull one out of their back pocket when they need to cross an ocean.\n- District bonuses.  Would be better to show all the bonuses a tile can confer so you can best place your district.  Annoying having to keep going back to the build menu to select each district to ensure you don't build over a tile which gave a better bonus for something else.\n- Better presentation of stats in general, especially when something is getting boosted by a wonder or a tech.  I shouldn't have to memorise how everything comes together in order to decide what to do.\n- Diplomacy is annoying.  Constant meaningless messages from other civs take you away from the game for far too long.  Really annoying to have a full screen animation just to receive a one-line message.  Just give us the message pop-up form!\n- Don't like cities having their own garrison.  Prefer having to build/manage defensive units.  Don't like how cities can bombard units just by having walls - if they added +1 range to garrisoned archers or something that'd be better!\n- Would rather have events, eras, etc to be in the context of your civilisation - instead of the context of you playing a board game.  \"Ancient Walls\" were not ancient when they were first built.  If my Civilisation is still building Crossbowmen, then I should still be in the \"Medieval Era\" - not moving into the \"Modern Era\" in the year 1900 because of another civ I've never met.  \n\nOverall feels like the game has been built and is better suited to a multiplayer experience - but I don't have the appetite for playing such a long winded game in multiplayer.

How on earth, unless i'm misunderstanding, can an ally of yours, in favor and in joint war with you have grievances? Or adopt grievances from someone they don't like?\n\n-Lack of options after you've made decisions to create your map, i've done about 10 hours of work into my city to be defeated by science to find I can't carry on playing! I will have to start over now.\n\n-Natural disasters seemed broken to me. I believe it was just random chance but ever other turn there were droughts and had to fix it and this was really early into starting the game before climate was being altered massively. This ruined it so much for me, again I started over after playing 4 hours because I wasn't enjoying that aspect.\n\n-They can make demands to remove your troops from border but you can't do the same? I denounced them for that reason, now it generated grievances and I paid the price by other leaders now denouncing me. Seems rather broken.\n\n-This is a great strategy game and having not played any of the others and this being the first, I was very impressed with it and the voice acting was superb.\n\n-Loved the way they have portrayed kings, queens and dukes ect.\n\nI just wish I could go back to my map and continue to play, it was getting so interesting, I was about to start a war with one leader and i had found some rare resources I just got going... it's on me of course to tick the victory bit, but last time I could just continue playing!! I got \"out of time\". Not happy at all with that.\n\nWhy did I also get a raid of barbarians in my village even though they are disabled? They pillaged some tiles of my city and had to fix them. Barbarians were just a nuisance for me.\nAn amazing game which has now left me wondering if i'll return. I probably may do, but i've restarted so many times due to rookie mistakes and problems with the game that can be customized in it's defense.\n\n(I played the game with the rules set to Gathering Storm.

Civilization 6 has the usual staples of the franchise; unique flavours tailor made for to each Civ and their leader, a diversity of victory conditions, semi-historical progression from the ancient era to the near-future, and city-centred production of buildings/units (including famed wonders), and military tactics. New to Civilization 6 is district placement (and its adjacency bonuses), which adds a long-term strategic decision into each city's production cycle. Furthermore, the game's aesthetic is updated (though arguably too pretty for someone who favours more realistic graphics) and it has continued to receive lots of content since its 2016 launch (though that is locked into paid DLC). Beyond that, there are other minor changes to this iteration, but it does not represent a fundamental departure from Civilization 5. For many, that is exactly what they are looking for. Enough new content was introduced at launch (and ongoing) to meet (if not exceed) their expectations. As the saying goes: \"If it's not broke don't fix it.\" But though I recommend and enjoy Civilization 6, I believe that Firaxis Games should have been braver in innovating the 4X turn-based strategy genre.", "timestamp_created": 1666824366, "timestamp_updated": 1666824366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685029983520508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133778197": {"recommendationid": "133778197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026189384", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25608, "last_played": 1693656431}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me tell you what Civ6 is like.\n\nImagine you're a boxer.

mentioned. \n\nThe positive you won't hear that often is that Civilization games are some of the most intuitive 4x games out there. Thanks to the fact that the game will ask you what to do with each available resource (be it research, city production or a unit), means that it's very unlikely that you end up completely wasting a big portion of your strength because you didn't know about it, as it may happen in other 4x games. If you feel overwhelmed by the concept of managing this much, Civilization 6 is probably the most likely game to ease you in the genre.\n\nA negative that you won't hear much about is that once you get to max difficulty, you will get a fair challenge (deity isn't that hard once you figure out all mechanics), but you will also get shoehorned into the same paths. It feels really bad that some aspects of the game become either completely out of reach (like building the great library is nearly impossible, if there's an AI that builds wonders it will build it before you can even research it) or a huge gamble to try (basically almost all wonders and any strategy that doesn't involve having 10 cities by the midgame). And then once you catch up to the most advanced AI, as long as it's not already a few turns away from victory, it's way too easy to win the game. I wish the devs added a machine learning based AI so we weren't limited in our early game tactics and we weren't bored by the late game when we already won.

I've also often found that adherence to actual historical reality is a make or break for whether or not I like or play a game. In that regard this game is perfect. It also is incredibly addictive.

Or rather the story of how one turn turns into 100.\n\nAs this is my first delve into turn-based games, I was a bit skeptical of the format. Would it be fun enough to keep playing? Isn\u2019t it too difficult to just start doing this without keeping track of every game mechanic? Oh, was my doubt misplaced \u2026\n\nStory\nThere is not much of a \u2018single player story / campaign\u2019 kind of thing. Every play-through (and it will be a lot) will be different, have different characters, different maps, different outcomes \u2026 I love the fact that certain leaders require certain types of play to get the most out of it. The narrator only adds to the \u2018historical\u2019 nature of the story you create yourself. No score however because it just doesn\u2019t really apply. NA/10\n\nGame-play\nWhere to start. As stated previously, this was my first encounter with such type of game. Having conquered my fears about mechanics, strategy, builds, information, \u2026 I really fell in love with CIV 6. Although on the outside these games seem very stationary and dull, it could not be much further from the truth. The changing environment, expanding countries, research advancements, exploration, \u2026 gave a dynamic kind of feel I didn\u2019t expect to experience here. Props to the developers for creating this overall feeling. The cliche of \u2018just one more turn\u2019 is the perfect compliment to the achievements made when creating this beautiful game. On multiple occasion I found myself forgetting every sense of time and keep on playing, well into the night. Many of times have I regretted playing until 3h00 in the morning on workdays. Yet, every time I return and [i]keep doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome[/i] (See what I did there \ud83d\ude09?) If you are new to this genre, don\u2019t be afraid to jump straight in. 8/10 \n\nMusic\nThe music in CIV 6 mostly consists of background music and a narrator\u2019s voice. Both add to the overall feeling of discovery, historical milestones, grandeur, diplomatic developments, technological advancements, science, \u2026 At multiple times I found myself having a blast humming in sync with the background music and feeling like being inside the past. It could get a little bit repetitive at times, but that is normal considering my play-throughs consisted of 4 to 6h sessions in one single sitting. This doesn\u2019t however take anything away from it. 8/10\n\nArt-style / graphics\nAlthough this is overall a beautiful game, it doesn\u2019t have the most advanced graphics, and a specific cartoony art-style that could perhaps not be your thing. I found myself questioning this during the first 5 minutes of play, but quickly grew fond of the style and \u2018don\u2019t take yourself to seriously\u2019-type of art this game displays. It is after all just that, a game. Could it have more fancy / up-to-date graphics? Yes. Could it have a less cartoony feeling and be more realistic? Maybe, probably. Would this impact the fun or feeling I have playing this game? No. CIV 6 has its own identity, and with that comes this art-style. 7/10\n\nOh Yeah\nOne thing I found both fun and annoying: The barbarians. In the early stages of a play-through they are quite strong and will obliterate everything on their path. Really annoying when you have a specific strategy in mind. After a little while however, they just become an annoyance, being there but not really mattering. I get why they are present, but man do they irritate me from time to time. \nSecondly, I found the religion aspect of the game to be dull and not worth my time. I don\u2019t think the developers spent as much time on this mechanic as on others, as it feels a little bit tacked on. None of my play-throughs I won with it, and on only one occasion did I even bother including this. I understand that this is included in the game, even necessary, but I personally think a different kind of meta-game is needed to make this an attractive aspect. \n\nAftermath\nAs of writing this review, I have completed and won 5 play-throughs on random maps with random leaders on random difficulties. I find the difficulty maybe a bit too easy, as I have won all of them, but it is still a challenge and still satisfying to win. All my time however was spent in single player mode. In next play-throughs, I will involve some friends and tackle multiplayer, having no Idea how this works. I will also look to create some custom games to increase overall difficulty or change the settings. Or set myself some goals.\n\nTo summarize\n+ Game-play, very addictive\n+ Story, very compelling although you must create it yourself\n+ music, Immersive background\n- Religion, bland and not attractive\n\nOverall score 7.5/10\n\nI highly recommend getting this game. You will get addicted to keep playing a turn and when all is said and done, the satisfaction is there. Will probably come back to this for the next 5 years or until a new one comes out (Yes, I\u2019m into Turn-based now).\n", "timestamp_created": 1672301126, "timestamp_updated": 1672301126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514613807201385498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141100594": {"recommendationid": "141100594", "author": {"steamid": "76561199386933284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 972, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1696462155}, "language": "english", "review": "e", "timestamp_created": 1688268799, "timestamp_updated": 1688268799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514397859573364258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147402703": {"recommendationid": "147402703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317735192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1479, "last_played": 1658807813}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.

The new idea of placing city improvements outside of the city is daft, it clutters the map, gone are the days when you could build forts on the hills around your city for your archers to pick out the attacking catapults. One of the worst changes is that builders are only good for 3 actions and then they expire.

Civilization VI is terrible. it sucks for many, many reasons. You shouldn't need to have an encyclopedia of knowledge on a game's mechanics to play it correctly, but unfortunately for this game, you do. I don't have 600 hours to watch PotatoMcwhiskeys video guides nor will I memorise 5 bibles worth of information because the developers couldn't string together coherent ideas.\n\nThere are too many bottom tier shitty mechanics that punish you. For example, If you take a city by force, it can automatically flip back to the original owner or turn into a barbarian city and there's more or less zero you can do about it. The game is absolutely rife with shitty game ruining mechaniics that make no sense. If I take a city fair and square it's mine you dumb developer motherfuckers!  \n\nDomination gameplay sucks arse. Your cities lose loyalty and flip back to their original owner or turn into barbarian cities. Who the fuck knows why? It's stupid as fuck it makes zero sense.\n\nSieging cities is a miserable experience. Positioning your troops is equally a frustrating miserable experience as you cannot stack your troops (not even a small stack) nor can you move through them in most cases. Terrible regression of gameplay. Unexcusable for a game like this to go backwards in this fashion. Positioning your armies around a city to siege it, while the city attacks and wipes out your troops quicker than you can position them, is FUCKING SHIT and infuriating.\n\nThe UN forces itself on you every 5 turns with no way to abstain or ignore it. Another stupid as fuck irritating gameplay mechanic on top of all the others. \n\nAll choices in technology feel like false choices. Every game is the same. I'll never forget the time the Norwegians sent iron clad destroyers through the English channel in 1100AD sinking my whole fleet making me insta quit the game. \n\nThe graphics have gone full Disney and it looks terrible. I guess it really says everything about who the target audience is. It definitely isn't me anymore. Despite the graphics being so poor, the game still take far too long to load what is effectively a boardgame, There is no excuse for how poor this game runs. Clicking \"end turn\" shouldn't be a 15 second loading screen for fuck sake!\n\nThis game deserves a lot more fucking heat than it gets. Fuck all the nice scores it gets. Fuck all the wankers saying it's some great fantastic game while ignoring the huge glaring problems and regressions from previous titles. It's shit, It's a shade of it's former self. The people who designed it sucked all the fun out this franchise and for me personally I will never buy another Civilisation game because of how badly they have violated the trust I had in them to deliver. Untempered rage is the only feeling I have in my soul for the people who made and sold me this fuckpile piece of shit game.", "timestamp_created": 1682217657, "timestamp_updated": 1682217657, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512437283992767334", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133288463": {"recommendationid": "133288463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115166381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3874, "last_played": 1677031740}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ef\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u28fc\u2880\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cf\u284f\u2804\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u285f\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u28b0\u2803\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2819\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u2804\n\u2804\u28b8\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2859\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u281b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2838\u28ff\u287f\u28f8\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2808\u2846\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2859\u2833\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28e0\u28e4\u28c0\u28c8\u2819\u2803\u2804\u283f\u2887\u28ff\u2847\u2804\ud835\udfda\ud835\udd39 \ud835\udd38\ud835\udd61\ud835\udd61\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd67\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd64!

You can't play 3-4 cities anymore normally\n3. Late game is awfully boring due to lack of normal action\n4. The only advantage of AI is excess of resources and bonuses, not the actual strategic maneuvers it uses. This is not interesting, since it doesn't offer any challenge\n5. No online ranking system\n6. No game servers\n7. No punishment for leavers\n8. Nothing to create normal multiplayer community\n9. Money drain DLC policy\n10.

Amazing art and music as always, excellent game mechanics and brilliant diversity of gameplay styles between the leaders and the empires they lead.

Because the game simply was not playtested enough. Civ6 is *shamefully* unstable. You can't play a regular game with a few friends without constant desynchronizations, reloads, crashes, dropped connections, bizarre errors where the AI takes over for a turn and moves all your units around, and just hours and hours and hours of frustration. \n\nCiv6 is, imo, not even worth getting for cheap, because the problem is not how much it costs. As a stable game, it would be worth whatever they charged for it. The problem is that you can't reliably play it! \n\nLook online at the huge, endless threads, everywhere from Reddit to CivFanatics to Firaxis' own forums. None of the stability issues have been solved in the -years- since Civ6 came out. They've barely even been *acknowledged!*\n\nYou can see that I have over a thousand hours in the game, too. Don't be fooled. A lot of this is accounted for by just leaving games up overnight, but much of it is \"hope springs eternal,\" reinstalling the game again in the hopes that a patch or a mod might fix this or that issue, or trying out the latest DLC before the inevitable crashes and errors start. \n\nIt just isn't playable, which is all the more infuriating considering that the actual -game- they produced is a gem.

The AI felt extremely dull, even in a domination-only mode with war declared multiple times. I seemed to be the only one who realized that we were at war. Civ5 AI would have hordes of combat units flooding your borders at any time. Meanwhile, Civ6, I just walked right in and started taking city after city (be it, it is a bit obnoxious how long it takes to bring one down from full health.) Combat rarely took place between the other AI. I had to quite literally force combat. Barbarians weren't even that big of a problem, except for when they have the chance to convert to a city-state. That's really annoying when its smack dab in the middle of what I wanted to be my expansion. Furthermore their tile usage was awful. The AI also wouldn't build anything or upgrade their land. I would be turn 400/500 in and they wouldn't have made barely any city improvements by the time I took over. Like, am I not remembering Civ5 right, and thinking the AI was far more complex, or am I just that bad? I nuked a few cities, just for the funsies, and came back to the area with an army about 40/50 turns later and they didn't repair anything (tiles on fire, etc), and the cities were still sacked at zero health??\n\nI also don't know if its a bug, but one of the AI kept nuking the same city over and over and over again, despite it basically being nothing by nuke 3. Kept happening for about six or seven turns, with two nukes each turn, before I finally walked up to the city and took it over with a single unit. \n\nSome of the system changes I also don't really like. The trade route system for one requires constant care and selection. Rather than the old model of build a road, you're good because it assumes people will use it to trade as a built in function, Civ6 requires you to actively manage trade routes with Trade Units. It's tedious and you don't get consistent bonuses with the trade. The Trade Unit also builds roads which are nice, but the roads don't establish a route by default. It adds a system I don't find too enjoyable, unless you're into the 'manage everything you can', in which case you will find yourself satisfied. Like at my end-game, I could have like nearly thirty trade routes... Who wants to manage THIRTY units just for trade? \n\nYou also can't trade captured capital cities for some reason? I just wanted to pillage and loot and trade off cities cause I didn't want to manage more, yet, if you don't want a capital, you have to select Raze or you're stuck with it forever. That's really stupid. \n\nI also don't really like the change to where builders have limited use. Again, I appreciated the ability to be 'hands off' when it came to tile maintenance. I would just set my city stats and citizens to what I wanted accomplished, made a few builders, then let them auto-set tiles for me. Civ6 completely removes this, and instead requires players to manage tile building, and you only get a handful of uses before you must spawn a new builder to continue work. I found this, again, too micromanaged for me.\n\nI do find the city management systems a bit better, tho. I enjoy districting and managing buildings, as well as the use-case for each type of district you build and what it means for your cities. I also like how you can hire barbarians to do stuff or ignore you. I also appreciate how spawning units will differ based on the type of unit it is and what kind of districts you have, meaning you can potentially spawn more stuff on one city. \n\nThe new art style I don't mind. Honestly, its not so much that any of it bothered me, except, I hate the new fog of war style. I'd rather it just be a darkened map color rather than converting to a 'paper map' texture. It throws me off, and I just don't like the map's inconsistent look. \n\nThat being said, after ~600 turns, I don't find myself wanting just one more...", "timestamp_created": 1689312287, "timestamp_updated": 1689312287, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509322881698608398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128941601": {"recommendationid": "128941601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207554423", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12496, "last_played": 1677472708}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played the game for a quite a while but suddenly every time I try to open a game it gets stuck on the loading screen.

Talk about a productive weekend!\n\nBut seriously, Civilization 6 is an amazing strategy game that will make you feel like the ruler of your own little world.

The game is so immersive and engrossing that you'll forget you're just playing a video game.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the graphics and sound design.

It is a polished, virtually bug-free game. No complaints. And \"if you liked Civilization, this is something similar.\"\n\nMy misgivings come from the game being Civilization VI. Because this is not the next Civ game, after Civ V, that I wanted.\n\nI've taken my time, played 92 hours, before accepting this conclusion. It's not the disaster that I considered Civ IV was. But it's also not the improved, developed from Civ V, game that I wanted. Instead it's yet another new game. Just as if it was another civ-like game, released to compete with civilization. New ideas, new mechanics. And unfortunately, I don't think any, single one of the many changes to gameplay is really an improvement. On the contrary. It is different though. But why would it be fun? A \"refreshing change\"?\nNow, Civ V could have some problems with synching progress to pace, particularly on faster pace and smaller maps, making it feel weird, But that's nothing compared to Civ VI. IMO, part of the weirdness and unsynch comes from all the time cities must spend to make builders or districts, neither activity furthering your city or civilization.\nThe maps turn out more boring than in Civ V. I don't think they are smaller, haven't checked though, but they feel smaller, more cramped. The assortment of leaders is uninspiring, to say the least. The cartoonish graphics don't appeal to me either. Gameplay feels more static than in Civ V. There's more going on but less happening, is how I'm tempted to describe it. But maybe I'm just playing it wrong. Can't be sure.\nThe really big changes feel ideologically motivated and are more an annoyance than a positive addition.\n\nI'm not completely done with this game, but I'm sure I'll keep playing Civ V more, much more.\nPity, there were so many incremental improvements that could have been done to Civ V.", "timestamp_created": 1677362616, "timestamp_updated": 1677362616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504461765289306641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129164275": {"recommendationid": "129164275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090182508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 155, "last_played": 1674116143}, "language": "english", "review": "After Civ 5, its really hard to recommend this product.\n\nImagine Civ 5 if the graphics were downgraded to make it look like it should be played on a cell phone or tablet.\nOn top of that it is streamlined even more...also to make you wonder why this isn't just for a cell phone or tablet.\nIf you're a fan of Civ4's art style, you may like this.

Because of this, linking an admiral becomes a nerf to your naval units. This is one of many oversights with an incredibly easy fix--just merge the admiral to the unit, or at least set the admiral's movement speed to its escort's speed.\n- Computer civs don't have enough divergence. The World Congress is the strongest example of this; they all vote exactly the same way, meaning A) their voting is incredibly predictable and B) there's no point in voting any way except how they do, because even if you stock up your diplomacy points for the ENTIRE GAME, you will literally never outvote them.\n- On that note, no amount of befriending has been enough to convince a computer to support you to the top. In my opinion, this is a change for the worse from civ 5 where you could convince computer civs to vote for you as world leader and act like an actual ally throughout the game.\n- It's too easy for districts to be pillaged for how long it takes to repair them. If an enemy spy triggers insurgents from your neighborhood (which they will because, again, literally every computer civ targets ONLY you with spy operations), your neighborhood will be instantly pillaged AND units will be spawned that will suicidally pillage nearby districts instead of fighting your units. You'll then have to spend 6+ turns, on Standard speed, repairing *each* district. Once you add in natural disasters, much of your late game production can become entirely devoted to repairing districts or else just leaving them pillaged. This is not fun gameplay.\n- Microtransactions. Not much else to say here, but I don't approve of this game's tactic of \"Hey, we made Canada a civilization. Want Canada? Pay us $3.\" Extra civs should be lumped into expansions with real, substantial content changes.\n\nThere's still a lot to enjoy here. They made some game modes and some mechanics that absolutely throw balance out the window and result in tiles with 20+ yields, which can result in some pretty fun chaos. It's also still got most of the usual good Civ stuff with the many different victory options and civilizations to try to master.\n\nI just feel like they went backwards in a lot of ways from Civ 5 and I wish they would put some effort into polishing at least the more glaring quality of life issues in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1667761095, "timestamp_updated": 1667761095, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501965939998626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142830034": {"recommendationid": "142830034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310976557", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2286, "last_played": 1689957182}, "language": "english", "review": "Boys help me out, my wife said if I get 100 likes and 20 awards, she\u2019ll buy me a new PC with a RTX 4070ti and a crate of beer this is NOT A JOKE!!!", "timestamp_created": 1690374064, "timestamp_updated": 1690374064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501901149749755859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127124048": {"recommendationid": "127124048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298947571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 98065, "last_played": 1695415422}, "language": "english", "review": "2 thumbs up", "timestamp_created": 1669507143, "timestamp_updated": 1669507143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50183868408203125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132700819": {"recommendationid": "132700819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031440161", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1676660764}, "language": "english", "review": "There is something missing here.

Some of the improvements are really good. The problem is the sum of all changes that did not work well.\nI played (and still do, lekmod mostly) almost 3k hours on civ5. I still I can't understand some of the changes they made. \nSo, basically this review represents my impressions, compared with very good civ5. So much time has passed and I also saw some streaming. \nHence I took my time to buy the complete edition, giving that the prognostics was not that good.\nAlso, in these past few days I played both games (5 and 6, alternatively) to try to be fair. All in single player too.\n\nImprovements:\n-Escort was a nice little improvement.\n-Culture tree is nice, with culture having a bigger role in the gameplay\n-Game is much more optimized, using much less pc resources.\n-Having similar popus being grouped (with little numbers on the top right corners of each) with different messages on mouse hover was another good one.\n-Having trade routes to build the roads is a nice little improvement. They had to do this, when they put limited usage for the workers (now called builders, just to confuse us or Idk) \n-That \"your empire makes history\" yellow/goldish big popup when something notable happes is a very good improvement/new feature.\n-Having the leader popup to say something and display the very same thing immediately after is unecessary.\n-Having the great general to display his area of influence was a nice little one.\n-Being able to save a game configuration is really nice. Not having to go through the advanced set up everytime is nice thing.\n-Having traders automatically build roads was also a good one. I wish they followed this \"auto\" moto behavior for other stuff too.\n\n\nConfusing stuff\n-Diplomatic favor: I do not know how they could have done it better. It is just not good.\n-O.M.G. what are those graphics? Am I playd a discovery kids game? Too colorfull. Also, Bigger units inside a tile did not work so well.\n-Took me a while to understand and differentiate amenities from housing. Yes, I know, not that hard. But having those icons so similar did not help.\n-About similar icons: this happens with a lot of them (keshigs and knights, etc). \n-I just can't see a plce for Loyalty in the game. I fully understand the concept. I just think it does not work well and should be removed. I will try a few more games to confirm this.\n-Why buildings now cost nothing to maintain? Does it cost and it is not displaying? Confusing. They it can be checked out in the yields report. The mouse hover tells us no more.\n-In civ5 we had a nice report about the current status of all civs. The new one is not so good.\n-Wtf is Era score? Sometimes I think they just added new kp\u00eds to make it look pretty on the screen.\n-Sometimes, there is so much stuff going on-on the screen that I cant see everything: city bombard defense, as an example.\n-Poor balance in Standard speed: most of the times, there will be not enough time to boost the discovery of trees. I had to go epic or marathon to try to have a more balanced game.\n-Religion is still useless, kinda like civ 5, kinda like life, actually.\n-Terribly ballancend timewise, and it gets worse as we choose shorter games.\n\nIt can be noticed that the bad stuff fully overcome the little good good stuff. One thing I cannot decide that is good or bad are the districts. Most of the times, I think it is good, added a interesting level of complexity.\nAnother times, when I just look at it, it feels unnecessary. I would settle it as a good one. Not sure. If we have round world horizontally\n\nOverall, I really tried to enjoy the game but it was not as satisfying as civ5. They tried to put too much features in one single game.

As a result, the community was fucked, and DLC starting with \u201cRise and Fall\u201d was no longer included in DELUX, all that was left was to buy more. And after that, people, blindly forgetting all the promises of the incompetent developers, continue to smear themselves with this shit and praise it. Your priorities are now clear. However, I believe that the crap in this \u201ctown\u201d needs to be shaken up. What's wrong with part six:\n1. The game had spyware, and it still does. In the end, everyone unanimously forgot this topic, although it was vigorously discussed back in 17-18;\n2.) AI on difficulty higher than \u201cPrince\u201d simply receives a damage bonus against the player and additional units for development, and the player receives a penalty to the bot\u2019s attack. Bots always hate you, under any circumstances, their demands are absolutely stupid due to national ideas and the whims of the leader. And this despite the fact that the development of your civilization will slow down due to complexity, so it will be virtually impossible to avoid hatred. On difficulty below \"Prince\" the AI is just as stupid, but it develops more slowly and its attitude towards you is warmer. The AI is not developed from the word \u201cAT ALL\u201d: you are either hated or inferior to you, but they will hate you more often, and on high difficulty - always. The strength of the AI lies not in tactics, but in the fact that at the beginning it receives a second settler, two detachments of workers, more troops and bonuses to damage against the player, and maybe even bonuses for the palace in the city. This is the same as making enemies 100% fatter in a shooter and doubling their damage. It won\u2019t make the game more interesting, it will only make the killing process longer. The developers are not much smarter than the AI itself if they couldn\u2019t come up with a good implementation for it. For an example of good bots: AI in \"Age of Empires II\";\n3.) The mediocre branch of \u201cTechnology\u201d and \u201cCulture\u201d. In the fifth part, the process of development of culture and science was simpler, without any stupid thoughts about connections with the regions (regions are a completely different topic, it\u2019s just fucked up). Technologies are scattered everywhere and often without any connection with the previous one; for some reason you can\u2019t download some technologies and forget about them. The same goes for culture. Eureka and inspiration? The innovation may indeed be interesting, but what to do if there are no barbarians on the map? Will I have to spend a ton of moves to unlock bronze processing? The eureka system has not been fully thought through. As a result, one player will appear on an island where it is actually impossible to get either eureka from barbarians or inspiration from city-states, and the other will receive all these pies and fly to a higher technology and institute. Well, one more important point: as soon as you open the so-called \u201cAt-Arms\u201d, in a few moves you will be able to get \u201cMusketeers\u201d, although there should be ARQUEBUSERS first, because they appeared earlier, motherfucker, and \u201cMusketeers\u201d were with XVI century, when firearms were already in use. Why the hell are these \u201cLatniks\u201d needed when they are already virtually obsolete after just one technology? There are no arquebusiers in the game, and the \"Field Cannon\" can only be upgraded to the \"Machine Gun Company\". And it\u2019s all about the distance from the opening of the \u201cField Gun\u201d to the \u201cMachine Gun Company\u201d. This distance is unreasonably huge, it is even greater than in the fifth part. I highly doubt that cannonballs were still in use at the end of the 19th century. Moreover, this gun doesn\u2019t even really do damage to the \u201cLine Infantry\u201d, which also opens VERY soon after the \u201cMusketeers\u201d. And doubts regarding operation are not at all false, because at the end of the 19th century, 75< caliber artillery pieces were already invented. Then why the hell are artillery installations only unlocked with TANKS, WHEN THEY WERE USED BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR?! Is it really so difficult to go to at least WIKIPEDIA and see for yourself? And no one cares that back in \u201cAntiquity\u201d and \u201cThe Middle Ages\u201d wagons were used to supply the army, but for some reason it opens only in \u201cModern Time\u201d. Apparently there were no field orderlies in the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d either; the developers know everything better than anyone. And in the game there are no: mortars, tanks and WWI assault infantry, anti-tank guns, PanzerSHREK and all civilizations have Shermans, when for such a price tag it was possible to make each civilization its own unique tank. They made swordsmen, why not make armored vehicles? And there is also incredibly little technology;\n4.) The most miserable builder system in the entire history of the series. I will never understand the joy of spamming workers and wasting moves creating them. THEY STILL DON'T KNOW how to make roads. And to make roads, you need CARAVANS, and to have more than one caravan, you need to make COMMERCE CENTERS, but it will be bad if there are no other areas or other shit nearby. It\u2019s hard to even comment on this, because the blazing ass can be seen from a distance of 30 km. But for some reason, A MILITARY ENGINEER CAN BUILD ROADS. Apparently you have to be a military man to do this. What kind of developers are all such bastards.

Some observations about this game as it stands alone, now that the adjustment period from Civ V is out of the way:\n\n - AI's military tactics are still extremely weak. It does not assemble its units for advantage, attack when it has the advantage, or defend its cities effectively. You'd think a fundamental goal for any game like this would be to have fronts naturally develop, as in a real-life war. Nope. Scattered, random skirmishes that the AI always loses. You can run the map with 1-2 infantry or cavalry units, plus 1 artillery.\n - Diplomacy mechanics bring nothing to the game. If you so much as defend yourself or retaliate against an aggressor, as one does in war, you're branded a warmonger. Were the Allies warmongers in WWII for conquering Germany? Leaders relentlessly spam you with their disapproval, consuming ridiculous numbers of UI-animation seconds before you can esc/cancel with each one. Despite claims that leaders approve of certain things, it seems to be an either/or, all-or-nothing, hair-trigger mechanism. A leader will love you one turn and denounce you the next, because they expected you to have one more military unit that turn or something. There is no nuance, spectrum, or \"scoring\" to this system, as far as I can tell, contrary to the claim that there are several levels between \"friendly\" and \"denounced.\" It's a waste of effort to try to get along with everyone while trying to win a science or cultural victory. Just let them inevitably declare war and fight them off.\n - Firaxis has figured out how to make leader interactions annoy you further and waste even more of your time. Clearly, you want to be spammed with an inconsequential 30-second message for \"good job\" \"or \"I hate you\" several times each turn - often interrupting your next click - and wait an additional several seconds for it to respond to multiple Esc presses.\n - The AI engine is SLOW. I've played on an i7-5930k and an i7-6850k, and on both, it takes up to a minute to process AI turns in late game. I think most hours spent playing this game are for the \"please wait\" stage. Why Firaxis cannot take advantage of parallel processing, or cache possible scenarios in advance while you're taking your turn, I do not know. There should at least be an option (or default) where other player moves have faster animations so that you can see what's happening without losing time, without making all the animations bizarrely short like in quick combat.\n - The lack of automated builders brings more tedium to the game than it does craftsmanship. In late game, I really no longer care about the details of each city; there are no real mistakes to be made, and I do not want to micromanage every single tile of every single city on a standard to huge map. Keeping the charge mechanic on builders, but adding an option to automate (or making it a technology, like a \"self-reliance\" civic) would probably still encourage early game caretaking, while removing late game tedium.\n - The game in general just feels slow and tedious. This is in no small part due to terrain penalties and weak road bonuses for unit movement. (And the fact you essentially can't deliberately construct roads; military engineer roads are too expensive.) Even in the middle ages, no, it didn't take 20 years for a unit to cross a civilization. It takes a lot of the oomph and fun out of army mobilization when it's far more practical to move single powerful units against the weak AI than to assemble melee and archer units into a tactically appropriate formation. There's simply no reason to bother with a combined arms / blitzkrieg approach in this game.\n - I like the districts mechanic in principle, but it's not flexible enough. Districts should be removable at a cost, or at the VERY least, there should be more information displayed in early game about the future optimal options for each tile. It's really not fun to try to wing it and guess where it will be best to place an industrial, commercial, or theater district in the future, before you can select those districts to see the adjacency bonuses. (Or for placing future wonders, each of which have strict, arbitrary requirements.) At the very least, there should be some sort of filter (a lens?) to display all adjacency bonuses on a tile.\n - Tile info popovers are slow and unreliable. Just show the dang info when I mouse over. I'm not afraid. At least make it so that mousing over a resource icon by accident doesn't prevent tile info from displaying until I leave the tile and reenter.\n - Personally, I think the air unit mechanics in this game feel awkward and unnatural. Why not just emulate real life instead? Carriers in real life can project power farther and to more places at once than allowed by the 2 short-range aircraft, as can air bases. Jet fighters intercept attacks, like in Civ V. They don't sit there and take it. No cruise missiles or ballistic conventional weapons in this game? They do exist in real life... Also, by the time you can build aerodromes and project significant air power, you could far more easily have created 3 times as many land units of greater power. The air game seems to be rather pointless, and is placed too late in the game in terms of military advancement. Air units are too weak for the time they take to acquire. Minor note: you'd also think cheap surveillance or attack drones would be making an appearance by now.\n - Nuclear weapons are thankfully a little more realistic in this game, since they really ruin whatever land you'd like to conquer, but at the same time, you've got to ask, of what use are they in the game? The AI never has a powerful enough conventional army where you'd need nukes to defend yourself. Since you can conquer all other civs with 3 army units, it's foolish to nuke them first and ruin your takings. Best guess, if you're trying to win a science or cultural victory, you'd like to ruin everyone else's day? If you're in the mood to go for one of those victories, initiating nuclear war doesn't really fit the bill.\n - In my experience, all games devolve into domination matches. As soon as someone attacks you (inevitable), you will have an army and be branded a warmonger for defending yourself. So you might as well remove the nuisance of neighboring civs who like to attack you. Nature then takes its course. Maybe this is a bit realistic, but it doesn't exactly meet the 4x, varied experience Firaxis is trying to accomplish.\n - City state and liberation mechanics are flawed. There is no real way to defend an allied city state, or even just to play peacekeeper. You're not notified that they are attacked, and you are not given any casus belli for declaring war. War of liberation (after the fact) also doesn't seem to become available when it should. If you do liberate a city, all your units are immediately expelled from that territory, bizarrely and unnaturally disrupting your advance in a way that just wouldn't happen in real life. Takes the fun out of liberating that neighboring continent that had been conquered by a single civ; liberating France as in WWII is literally impossible.\n - So tired of hearing \"best not to aid that city state\" from other leaders. What are you talking about? I didn't aid any city state. Which one???\n - The tech/civic boost mechanic is neat, but it makes games far too uneven. Either I hit all the boosts by the luck of the map and launch a moon landing or accidentally win a culture victory in 1700, or I'm tied up in a war for 500 years (in which I can't go on the offensive to end it or else become a warmonger), miss a lot of the boosts, and discover petroleum in 1960.\n\nI fired up this game this morning on a sick day to pass the time, and found that it's more fun to write this review than to sit through any more hours with the game.

That game, and Civ 2, 3, and 4, helped keep me going.\n\nWith Civ 5, another friend talked me out of the kiddie pool of lower difficulty settings, and I discovered how much fun each of the 40-some sides could be.  The same friend gifted me Civ 6, for last Christmas, and I liked it so much, I gifted the $80 every-DLC-as-it-comes-out edition to another friend.  I put about 15,000 hours into Civ 5, and have already put over 4,000 hours into Civ 6.  \n\nMy first impression was as bewildered as had been my first encounter with Civ 5.

I'm no veteran Civ player, I've only played 5 and 6, though I'm aware that 3 and 4 are still good games. However, even coming from 5 which had it's own disappointing launch, 6 is a massive drop in depth and quality. No matter how hard I try, I cannot lose myself in this game the way I did in 5. I'm never on edge, wondering what will happen next, because I know what'll happen next. War. War for settling wrong. War for being the wrong religion. War for governing wrong. War for being too strong and too week (at the same time). War for not trading. War for simply existing in a manner that doesn't quite suit somebody else. What seems to be an attempt to inject some personality to diplomacy with \"agendas\", results in predictable games where everyone hates you, or everyone loves you (until they don't). There's never a middle ground.\n\nOn agendas, certain civs simply don't play themselves as they should. Hey Brazil, I see you've denounced literally everyone on Earth for making more great people than you. Would you like to change that? Maybe build a campus or theater square? No? Just gonna build another encampment? Thought so. Nice to meet you China. No I didn't realize you were the preemminent builder of wonders in the world. Do you know why? It's because you never built one China, that's why. Ah, Cleopatra, I see you're now chronically indecisive, as you simultaneously hate and love large militaries, and simply can't make your mind up. These agendas will override everything else you do with/to another civ. If you are friends with America and watch helpless as the Aztecs burn and pillage their way across the continent, you might be inclined to pitch in on good ol' America's behalf. But more fool you, because you see, America hates people who declare war on his neighbours, even if those neighbours are currently enslaving his own people and turning his cities to ash. A man's got to have a code after all. Now you're a warmonger. Why? Good question, but it's ok, Alexander the Great still loves you.\n\nThe next part of my rant jamboree is the design of the game, such as unit scaling and modelling and such. Before the game was launched there were many people who expressed concern over a \"mobile game\" aesthetic, justly concerned that 2K might be trying to grant their next installment with some more mass appeal at the expense of anyone being able to take this seriously. Thankfully, the gameplay hasn't been dumbed down, so much as screwed up (see agendas). I am not terrified of this army of strangely proportioned stretch armstrong figures marching towards me, because I'm too distracted by the trader, whose cart is 2 or 3 times taller than my palace. In Civ 5, when the Mongol horde was at my borders, it stretched on and on like, well, a horde. Now it appears to be maybe 20 horses all together, each being roughly the size of an entire building, and altogether looking rather silly. If course there's another reason not to be intimidated by the Mongol horde, or anyone else's horde for that matter. The entire combined forces of all other AI civs could be beaten back with a damp rag and a can do attitude.\n\nThe AI in Civ 6 cannot war, which is particularly damning in a game that always ends in a war. Alexander the Great of Macedon may command the most fearsome force known to man, but rest assured, it'll be soundly defeated by simply doing the following; ranged units + garrion promotion, place in city centres and encampments. Or just wait them out, when you think the enemy has gained the advantage they'll just sit there and contemplate life, or throw themselves away on fortified units with ranged support. It's worth pointing out that at launch the AI did not even know how to use boats or planes, so I wouldn't hold your breath or anyone elses for any of this to change any time soon.\n\nI will now try to think of some nice things to say about Civ 6. You can use mods in multiplayer games fairly easily. See that overpowered civ from your favorite TV show that was obviously made by a fan with no thought to game balance? Yup, you can bring that into a game with your friends and make them regret basking in your presence. The most fun I've managed to have in this game has been with friends, where the only real competition in science, culture, faith and of course, war, are the other human players. The AI might aswell be so many other city states. Oh and the music. While I miss wartime music (listening to the cheerful Kongo theme while nuclear hellfire engulfs the planet is a bit jarring) the whole idea of music evolving with eras is just fantastic. Entering the industrial era to \"Scotland the Brave\" blaring in your ears while you agressively bagpipe the inferior nations of the world into submission is satisfying, to say the least. But then you realize that you're building the same cities all over the map, and that the last game you tried to get into was the same as this one, and that enemy you've been contending with isn't really contending so much as falling behind because he decided to give up on winning. And then everyone denounces you for being close to winning yourself. And then I get tired of this and try and get Civ 5 to work again with a bagillion mods.\n\n(oh yeah and districts aren't that special, I always end up building the same 2 or 3 different cities with no variation)\n\n(I'll stop typing now I am very tired)\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have so many hours played in this game because of friends who used to enjoy playing it. As they lost interest, I lost interest. There were other mods I used that also made it fun, which are no longer usable since the summer patch (I think, it might have been the spring one I can't remember). I cannot reccomend this game because it does not stand up on it's own as a civ game should. Time and time again the modding community has found and fixed bugs that should have been dealt with before release. Maybe the next big dlc will make Civ6 a game worthy of the franchise, I don't know. Until such a time I do not think anyone should buy this game. That is my opinion and I am entitled to it no matter how many hours I have played, or whether or not I \"got my money's worth\".\n\n(While I understand where some people are coming from with the \"you played a bunch but didn't like it so why did you play it\" mentality, I would not take any review seriously with few hours played, regardless of wether they reccomended it or not. If my friends came with the game in a sort of package deal, then sure I'd reccomend it, but I got them elsewhere)\n\nGS EDIT:\n\nAnother DLC, and with it some more game mechanics for the AI to struggle with. There's really not much more to it than that. Obvious one is climate change and disasters, of which there is very little change and it's not very disastrous. Just keep a builder or two on stand by if you're in a disaster prone area and you'll be fine. Of the couple times I've had the patience to see a game to completion, not once did the sea level rise, which leads me to believe that you have to really go out of your way to screw up the planet. The main incentive for burning fossil fuels seems to be powering tier 3 buildings in certain districts. Not only is this not necessary, as these buildings still provide their standard yield, but you can just hold out for cleaner energy sources a couple more techs down the line.\n\nThe other \"new\" mechanic is the world congress (for some reason starting in the year 500 AD), which at the very least is a more nostalgic kind of stupid. Fans of Civ 5 can look back on fond memories of the great nations of the world banding together against the true enemy of civilization, truffles. Voting yourself is pointless (unless you're playing Sweden), because the AI will mass vote to ban random things regardless of whether it hurts them or not.", "timestamp_created": 1532984941, "timestamp_updated": 1552233796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 990, "votes_funny": 126, "weighted_vote_score": "0.931797325611114502", "comment_count": 89, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121170172": {"recommendationid": "121170172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158823688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 26812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22550, "last_played": 1688308028}, "language": "english", "review": "I've allegedly played 375 hours of this but all i did was play a few more turns.", "timestamp_created": 1661355697, "timestamp_updated": 1661355697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 156, "weighted_vote_score": "0.931034445762634277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48722141": {"recommendationid": "48722141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974906336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 68289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35168, "last_played": 1691897609}, "language": "english", "review": "I have almost 600 hours on this game and I like it.

Let's go with the basic simple review, is this better than Civ 5?\n- Eh, it's more flexible i guess. In Civ 5, i either kill everyone and conquer every cities on the planet or just turtle up myself with any number the tradition policies told me too. Districts system is good that you could give your cities their actual characteristic, probably the best part of Civ 6. Eureka systems are good but sometimes lead to repeatitive early game interactions like \"Try to kill barbarian with this Slinger\" or \"Make 2 Galleys\", some of them also depend on map RNG.\n\n2.)Is the game well-balanced?\n- Lol, nope. Some Civs are very strong since the Ancient Era while some are like playing without any bonuses until Renaissance. Babarian can be annoying most of the time, sometime they went full Genghis Khan and dunk 5 Horsemen into your face on very early game (I think Babarian condition that \"If they are any Horse resource nearby, they will make even more Horsemen\" are work even with horses in your cities). City-States do something weird as well, some will never make more than 5 units, some will make 10+ units and make traffic on the continent worse than morning rush hours, so ally with some City-state don't improve your army while some could eradicate some armies for you. City start could be very bad or extremely good, coastal start like Spain or England could be pretty bad.\n-Edit: Somehow 2K went buffing and nerfing some Civs, Norway, England and Spainish got buffs and Kongo got a nerf.(DLC Civs are still OP, no worry). Barbarians're still annoying, I don't think they touched this part anyway. \n\n3.)Is patching, bug fix or A.I improvement come fast?\n-Edit: 2K seem to give out the seasonal patch and update(?), some of it actually make the game better while some of them are pretty bad(like making Alliance with A.I. in latest patches which is pretty annoying)\n\n4.)2K sell so many DLCs, should I support them?\n- No idea, Just be yourself. The prices are a little higher than a TCG pack in my country, so i'm not that mad about it. \n\n5.)Should I purchase it now?\n-If  it's on sale and you will play it right now, yes. If you want to play it later, No, wait for better patch or expansion.\n\nTL;DL: It's good game design and improvement over Civ5, but still need more patches and balancing. The decision is up to you, but for me it worth it, maybe.\n\nEdit: Ok after realize so many people actually read my gibberish review so I guess I will update the update, patching, and some other parts.", "timestamp_created": 1498581228, "timestamp_updated": 1506912486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2227, "votes_funny": 68, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926930665969848633", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97705807": {"recommendationid": "97705807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048300311", "num_games_owned": 1139, "num_reviews": 193, "playtime_forever": 19171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1549, "last_played": 1693381435}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it.\n\nAnd you know the guy who said don't start it before going to sleep?\n\nYeaaaah.

These in hand effect how you govern or opens up more to how you can govern better to your preferred style. For instance one of my favourite abilities from Civ4 'Serfdom' has reappeared and the way this ability works is pretty great.\n\n2: Still Fight Barbarians\nin previous games when you reach a certain age or a unit reaches a certain experience I have found that those units no longer gain experience when fighting barbarians, thats now changed. you can still level a unit but unfortunatly its at a very slower rate than if your up against a civilization target. Yet still its good that when you come up against mauraders trying to pillage your sea tiles that you can be rewarded.\n\n3: Districts\nAt first I wasn't sure if I liked the idea of districts or not but I think the more I play the more I like. The idea behind districts is that your cities are not just on one tile but can spread out over several tiles. This in my opinion can be a blessing or a curse. It can be a blessing if you find the right spot to build a city and there are plenty of boosters for your districts like Mountains or rainforests for science districts. The curse comes more with the lack of space issue. Especially if you land in a location and raise a city only because you find valuable resources, but the city could fail to see its potential due to a lack of district space. The game forces you to make more wiser decisions.\n\n\nThose are the main likes, here are my main dislikes.....\n\n1: All roads lead to Rome?\nErr no they don't, the way you build roads has been redeveloped for some bizare reason and they no longer have the abilities of earlier Civ games. First of all your builders no longer create roads, only traders and a new engineer unit can build roads. If you task a trader to trade with another one of your cities it creates a road on its path. If you use an engineer, the unit only lasts for 2 active turns and then disappears, they seem to be a waste of time imo............ Roads no longer give you any advantage anymore, they don't provide added tile wealth like in previous games, and they don't really offer any movement advance for units, e.g. 3 tiles instead of one, in fact I have seen units avoid roads for some reason.\n\n2: Oh and the same for builders\nThats right, with no modifications your builders only have three active turns, meaning that you can only get them to develop three tiles. So for example in previous games if you wanted to say redevelop a pasture hill with rainforest to build a mine, it might take e,g, 10 turns to do everything from cut down the rainforest and then build the mine, now it take 2 of your 3 goes, one to cut down the trees one to build mine. The only saving grace is that every action is instant, cutting trees take one turn, building a mine is one turn etc etc. I am not entirely sure why the devs have done this, and especially why they have changed the way roads are built and work. my only conclusion is to reduce map congestion, but that should be left to the player to decide.  I used to love having a transport ship filled with builders who follow and invasion in case I have used nukes or if I need to redevelop the infastructure. Can't really do that now.\n\n3: Boot polish can make it shine\nWell I think in this case there is a distint lack of polish and especially when the game costs \u00a350 - \u00a370 depending on what version you get before any discount is alarming. There are a lot of bugs in this game and things missing that I would expect from previous games from the get go.  One bug is when a Civ tries to contact you but then does nothing, the animation is still playing for the civ leader but no pop ups, Why does this happen? Well I have worked out that parts of the game work to quickly, and when the game is catching up the game crashes. This is not a PC speed issue as it would happen all the time otherwise. Another bug which I have experienced and it seems reading the reviews for the game so have others, other leaders are easy to piss off. For instance if you build a wonder or choose a different form of government, other world leaders seem to go into a nerd rage.\n\nAlso why do the devs still insist on not having transport ships and forcing one unit per tile, its so redundant and slow, also where are my paratroopers? I love paras as they offer a great dynamic to combat.\n\n4: A lack of consequence\nOne of the things I loved about Civ4 (imo my favourite version I think) was that every important game changing task you did had concequences. For example, you got caught spying big time, it had consequences, you have developed Nukes, it had concequences. Now nothing does. I had caught a civ trying to steal cash and sabotage districts, and in spite the fact they apologised, they did it again several turn later. I declared war which seemed the only way to stop them, but I turned out to be the bad guy for doing this and ruined the end game because everyone hated me and called me a warmounger. Put this down to a bug or intentional, either way it ruined my game.\n\n5: Out pricing the future\nYep as it seems with all games these days the polish comes in the form of overpriced DLCs. At \u00a325 I think I will wait for the sales before I purchase \"Rise and Fall\". \n\n\nIt seems that I actually hate this game considering that I put more negatives but I don't, I struggle to hate any Civ game even when newer versions remove the stuff I really loved. I just think that when you make a conscious decision to buy the game you do it knowing the negative points. There is still enough love in this game to make it enjoyable but thats where you as the player come into it.", "timestamp_created": 1513645560, "timestamp_updated": 1515721532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 413, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925818681716918945", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78770543": {"recommendationid": "78770543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342391713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 70550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60010, "last_played": 1684098914}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly feel the need to warn people about this game.

However, upon playing this game, I have noticed that no matter how many times I play Civ 6, I cannot get into it. It's like something was missing in which the previous Civ games had that this one does not. Then it hit me; this game was missing the UNCERTIANABILITY FACTOR.\n\nNow when I say the uncertainability factor, I mean the tiny gray area that makes the game truly unqiue. Where you have just enough room for error that the game could be good or bad for you, where you could do something that you could not in other games, and where you were not entirly sure how the game could truly play out. In other words, the mystery factor of the Civilization games that kept you guessing: \"What happens next?\"\n\nNow here are a few examples from CIVs 3, 4, & 5 that will help paint a clear picture of what I am talking about: \n\nIn Civ 3, I rememmber where you could attempt to sail across the ocean tiles before researching the appropiate tech. In most cases the ships would sink (unless you had the lighthouse wonder), but in those very few instances you could cross those ocean tiles and get away with it (which gave me a sense of happiness each time it happened). This was not the only instance in where there was some kind of flexibity allowing you to get away with acts that could help you or hurt you, as there were also volcanos. It was very hard to know if you built a city next to one or not, resulting in a destroyed city (with its surrounding areas) anytime through out that particular game; it could also happen multiple times in the same area in the same game too. As I stated before, there was a potential of flexibility that could either make or break your game by taking chances.\n\nIn Civ 4, there was the randomized event sequence in which gave the player(s) good bonuses or bad ones. It was very randomized & had a large pool of events making it hard to repeat the same ones over and over again (not to mention that anyone of the events could happen at anytime of the game, begining or end). This meant that every game you played was different resulting in playing the best or worst game you ever played. It is worth noting too that your opponents (players or AI) could receive these events at different times as well. For example, your iron resources could be granted additonal production or subtracted depending on the event. Then there is my favorite, hordes of barbarians could suddenly show up next to one of your (or your opponent's) cities and start rampaging. Regardless of what or when these events happened , this brought about a sense of curiousity of \"what happens next.\"\n\nFinally in Civ 5, each resource had a varied amount of resources, resulting in a finite or limited number of strategic units using those same resources. For example, you could find three resources of iron; one having 3 iron, one having 2 iron, and the last one having only 1 iron which resulted in having a potentional of 6 units using iron (unless you went on to find more iron). This made the game very competitive for other players (and AI) to grab these resources as soon as possible. Not to mention too that you could never know how many of those resouces were near you or not. It could be the difference between one civ dominating the classical & medevial age due to having asburd amounts of iron and then crumble in the mordern age due to having very few oil resources. In other words, that the game can change from good to bad, or vis versa, depending on circumstances in the game.\n\nNow I am not saying that these examples, that I have listed, need to be added into the game; but I do beleive that the intent of each one of them represents needs to be addressed. The point is that Civ 6 does not have that uncertainability factor that makes the game a truly unqiue & mystifing expereince as did the last few Civ games had. It has no flexibility, no sense of curiousity of what happens next, and no true game changing sequiences (although the R & F expansion was a good start) that would ultimately define the rest of the game. I want to love this game soooo much....but I can't, not until this missing element is adressed and implemented. I am hopeful that the creators will read this, if it gets enough likes, and understand why Civ 6 is missing a key element that nearly all CIV games have had up until now and take action to solve this. \n\nThank you all for reading this.", "timestamp_created": 1539383610, "timestamp_updated": 1539383610, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 735, "votes_funny": 23, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918693065643310547", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117745764": {"recommendationid": "117745764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029468733", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 28227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28224, "last_played": 1683758966}, "language": "english", "review": "I uninstalled after suffering from \"just one more turn\" syndrome that reduced my average sleep length from 8hrs down to 5.5h.

But releasing a game as a \"Platinum Edition\" which cost like 60 bucks, only to then release a \"New Frontier Pass\" DLC for 40 bucks more is a particularly scummy practice.\n\nWe gamers need to band together and only buy it on heavy discount to send them a message. Please don't buy this stuff at full price and signal that this behaviour is acceptable.\n\nBecause otherwise what does \"Platinum\" mean? And where do we go after this? \"Triple-quadruple platinum with unobtainium gemstones\"?  Label is misleading, and they deserve to be punished for that.\n\nEdit: punctuation.\n\n-----\n\nEdit II [22 I 2021]: Wow, this blew up. Thanks for all the points, guys. I thought to address some of the comments. Some valid, some not so much. \n\nHere is the thing, there are people who buy the game at- or near- release, and they have to pay a high financial price for it. Time goes by, game gets cheaper. This is, I daresay, a reflection of economics. It's kind of like going to the cinema when a film first premieres (expensive), and then watching it on Netflix decades later (-almost- free). It seems justifiable for DLC to remain expensive for first-movers. Theoretically there is a first-mover advantage, if nothing more than the fact that multiplayer servers remain more populated. But yes, beyond a certain amount of time (and here I cannot actually say for sure how long), the DLC prices should be moderated.\n\nSecondly, the fact that I paid a bit less for Platinum than someone did is not really relevant to the point. It is kind of like saying, \"hey, OP got poked in one eye, she should be happy she didn't get poked in both eyes.\" I submit, humbly, that we should be going after the rogue eye-poker, instead of the eye-pokee.\n\nThirdly, someone was saying that marketing is prone to exaggeration. This person, I suggest, is not legally educated. There is a difference between \"mere puff\" and \"misrepresentation.\" For about 25 years between 1990 and 2015, \"Gold\", \"Platinum\" and \"Game of the Year\" Editions have been known to denote a rather specific arrangement of games, usually to the effect of the inclusion of the base game, together with all the expansions.\n\nWords have meaning. To quote a mediocre film of a good book: \"Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.\" If words do not have meaning, then one day you will find yourself served sh*t on a shingle, have that called \"breakfast\", and you will be happy to eat it even if you aren't.\n\nSomething [b][u]IS[/u][/b] wrong here. Fortunately, the market is democratic, and we are the constituents, and we have the power to change things.\n\nI only respectfully ask that we do.\n-----\n\nEdit 3: 21 Nov 2022\n\nWith the launch of the Leadership pass, I can say that it is a good step towards remedying the previous review qua DLC.

The crucial problem of this game is that the vast majority of decisions made by the player ultimately don't matter, and the decisions that do matter will have the same right answer time and time again. In a nutshell, Civ 6 is shallow and repetitive. It doesn't work.\n\nWar is always the right answer. The fastest way to a cultural victory is to steal the hard work of a cultural player. The fastest way to science victory is to take over other Civs for their science output. War is also the best way to spread your religion. So by pursuing the domination victory, you inevitably end up doing what is optimal for all other victory types as well. Hence, war is always the right answer and the game is broken. \n\nDiplomacy is broken. It's broken to the point of comedy. For example, Frederick gets mad if you get friendly or become Suzerain of city states. Now heres the question: Is it ever within the players advantage to choose to not become friendly with city states so as to avoid angering Frederick? No, of course not. So what ends up happening is that Frederick will hate you every single game. And what's comical is that every character's agenda is similarly broken and ends up having the same effect as Fredericks. It's inevitable that every AI character will hate you just for playing the game properly. Not to mention that war is always the right answer and war mongering penalty is steep, so it's best to just ignore diplomacy entirely- it's so irrelevant that it's not worth the brain space of thinking about it.\n\nThe characters are severely unbalanced. Scythia and Sumeria are unstoppable. Germany is also well above the rest of the cast because of its high production output. It's like they never play tested the game. The special abilities of most of the cast don't matter because they are designed for a Civ game when Civ 6 is a game of war. \n\nThe Eureka boosts add to the games repetitiveness. The effect they have is that you end up doing the same actions in the same order over and over again. This reduces the extent to which decisions are made in response to what is going on in the environment. The effect is disastrous in what is already a repetitive game.\n\nThe user interface is awful. The game interrupts itself constantly with the same annoying cut scenes. Skipping through them is too slow and they get old fast. Again, it's clear that this game wasn't adequately play tested.\n\nThis game is also glitchy. It's gotten better since release, but it's still far from a polished product.\n\nIf another player wins the game, it skips immediately to the \"defeat\" cutscene. It jumps to this cutscene so fast that you don't know who won or by what victory type. This can happen seemingly out of nowhere if the AI gets a non-domination victory (usually a religious victory, I have never seen an AI get anything but a religious victory. It is by far the easiest victory type for the AI against the player- just to mention another thing that is broken). It's extremely frustrating to put many hours into a game only to have it end abruptly. In order to figure out how you lost, you have to select the \"just one more turn\" option and then do detective work. It's just awful.

But AI and diplomacy is broken.\n\nI like the city districts and the strategic possibilities it entails.  But it feels like they spent all their time on that mechanic.\n\nImagine being invited by a nation to help them fight a war, and then get denounced by the SAME country as a warmonger for your troubles.  Imagine getting suprised attacked by a nation, defending yourself and taking one of that nation's cities in retaliation and being denounced as a warmonger by that nation and everyone else.  Imagine liberating a nation long-dead for millennia, no acknowledgment of thanks, and then being denounced by the same liberated nation as a warmonger.  Welcome to Civ VI, where you are hated no matter what you do.  And no matter what victory condition you start with, you always end up wanting to nuke the &*$@#^& out of the nations around you.  For the first time in all the Civ games I've played I wished there was an option to execute opposing leaders, that's how annoyed I got.  Ah to see the eternally annoying Phillip II lose his head, now THAT would be fun...\n\nWait there's more!  Imagine being asked for a gift of resources, plus gold, plus gold per turn.  You think to yourself, \"I feel generous today\" and offer at least the resources and the one-time gold, but not the gold per turn.  Well, these entitled pricks will tell you, \"Not good enough!  We want a gift from you the way WE say it.\"  It's unreal.  So back to nuking them.  Honestly I cannot understand the thinking that went into the diplomacy, it's the worst I've ever seen.  It doesn't just feel unfinished, it's plain bad.  As usual your opponents get to say snarky comments and threaten and bully you and you get no options to respond.  This has been an issue for me in previous games too, but it's even more exquistely painful in Civ VI.  \n\nAnd the AI does ridiculous things like FLOOD your country with their missionaries and apostles, blocking your path and there's no option to even say, \"Hey, can you relax with the religion thing?\"  I had to declare war multiple times just so I could move around my own empire.  And of course, the flood of hate and denouncing hits you from all sides.

I've grown up playing the series since Civ II, when I was only eight years old. This series has shaped what I know and  expect out of any strategy game, and will forever serve as a litmus test to other strategy series. I can play any number of games and genres, but I always go back to Civilization when I grow bored of the others. Keeping this in mind, Civ 6 has been a huge disappointment to me and fails to compare to its predecessors in any way. \n\nMany new features are welcome improvements (though admitedly adapted from other comparable series): the introduction of districts, policies, and changes to various science, espionage, religious, and military aspects. I even warmed up to the art style very quickly in my first playthrough. They carried over enough of the previous games to make it easy for me to pick up and start playing right away. Unfortunately, they left behind the soul of the previous entries. \n\nCiv, for me, has always been a single-player game first, making interaction with the AI one of the most important features in the game. I like how they made the AI react differently to my playstyle. I like that I can have reasons (casus belli) to declare war, drastically reducing warmonger penalties to the AI. Unfortunately, all of this means nothing since the AI is deperately broken. They will declare wars against you and other civs for absolutley no reason, and then beg you for peace, giving you all of their resource. City states will either be technologically inept in the later game, or wildly advanced beyond any civ close to them. Harder difficulties don't make the AI play any better - they just get more settlers and builders to start. It took them six months just to patch the AI to make it playable, but it still needs improvement.\n\nTo make matters worse, Firaxis is taking the Paradox route by nickel and diming fans just to get the \"bonus\" content of new civilizations, which are honestly desperately needed for the enjoyment of replayablility. As of this review, they are charging a minimum of $5 [u]per[/u] new civilization. I felt that Civ 4 and 5's expansions were perfect - these expansions brought multiple new civs, leaders, and game changing content, all for the better. Yes, they were more expensive, but they brought so much that they were [i]so[/i] worth it.

Early game is more diverse. You have more decisions to make - and everything you do feels \"right\"\n2. Mid game is incredibly fun. Now that you aren't constantly battling your happiness meters, you have time to focus on your goals. You have many ways of remaining stable in the mid-game and expanding further. \n3.  Civic tree is now researched just like the tech tree. Both these trees feel like they have a very real and important impact on your strategy and gameplay, without making you feel like you have to constantly check for optimal routes. This is huge.\n4. The little things. I can't go over them all, but: linking units, how harbors now work, barbarian AI, naval changes, dipomacy, natural wonders, resources (inc. luxury and strategic), unit upgrades, builders/repairs, and religion all feel so much better in CIV 6. They feel very well designed and not cumbersome at all\n\nCons:\n1. As of now, I think the lategame is worse than in CIV5. It's hard to quantify with my limited playtime but it's not really that much worse. I feel that expansions will offset this.\n\nOverall:\nEarly and Midgame are SO much better than CIV5. Lategame is slightly worse than CIV5. I think it's beyond worth it. As a base game, it's almost better than CIV5 withall the expansions, so I'm very excited to see how CIV6 expansions help the game out.", "timestamp_created": 1477150132, "timestamp_updated": 1477150132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 600, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90243065357208252", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26138688": {"recommendationid": "26138688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137963079", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "playtime_at_review": 1749, "last_played": 1695906330}, "language": "english", "review": "+Intro video. \nThe intro is great. Although it is no Baba Yetu, the video combined with the awesome score had me in chills. The last game's intro was really good as well but this one was just spectacular and a great way to introduce players to what will be an extravagant game. \n\n+Main menu. \nVery good looking and very intuitive. It is much more simple this time around, with few sub-menus that you have to nagivate just to start or continue a game. The options panel has many, many settings. There is also a \"New to Civ VI\" advisor option for returning players. There is now a benchmark to test your system.\n\n+Civics and research.\nI thought, coming into this, that I would not like a second tree, but it in fact helps to expand the gameplay especially with the addition of governments and policies. \nResearch now adds more to your game, not just a building and a unit here and there. The game feels like it is tailoring itself for you quicker than it would in Civ V.\n\n+Governments, policies and casus belli.\nOne thing I thought that I was certain to hate was the removal of social policies and the addition of governments and policies, especially with the card system. However, it has turned out to be very useful especially when you need a specific resource like gold or faith, or if there are many barbarians surrounding you. You can unlock more governments and policies in the civics and research trees. \nCasus belli, which is a justification for war, is a great addition to this game. There are many different casus belli in the game. Declaring a liberation war can be used if someone has captured one of your or one of your allies' cities. The warmonger penalty for this is nothing, but only for the recapture of that city. There is a holy war, which is war on a civilization whose religion has been spread to one or more of your cities. All warmonger penalties for this are halved. There is also a  reconquest war, protectorate war and a few more.\n\n+Districts. \nI also thought that I would dislike districts and having to manage each one and finding space to build each one, pre-planning cities etc. But it had turned out to be a service and a great addition to the game. There are many more district types than I had initially realised. This all sums up to a very unique game.\n\n+Huge maps. Compared to the pre-installed maps in Civ V, these maps are huge and a treat to explore! I recommend setting the amount of civilizations in your game to upwards of 8. It had taken me over 150 turns to find another civ in a game of 8 civs on Continents. I was really starting to question whether there were any other civs or not.\n\n+Great people and promotions. Great people are truly great. Each unique great person has a unique ability, except for the great prophet. This mixes the gameplay up a bit and adds variation.\nPromotions now have their own tree. They also heal the unit, not to full health though which is still a very nice feature. \n\n+Trading, envoys, and builders. \nTrading takes on a new format which I feel is much more customisable. Traders add roads as they travel and have new bonuses.\nEnvoys are better ways to handle gifts from city states. You do not have to be an ally (or suzerain) with a city state to receive its bonus, just send an envoy. \nBuilders now have charges like Great Prophets, Missionaries and Inquisitors did in Civ V. This might seem like a bad thing, but they get the job done on the turn that you order them to do it.\n\n+Game length. In Civilization VI, the developers have stated that they have tried to lower the game length to just get through everything faster. This is definitely a positive thing. Before this game was released, I started a Standard Speed game from Ancient era in Civilization V. After playing for around 10 hours, I was in the industrial era. After around 10 hours on Standard from the Ancient era in Civilization VI, I have almost completed the Research and Civics trees.This helps to filter out all of the repetitiveness and the waiting around and it does a good job at that.\n\n+Graphics. The graphics, which can be considered cartoony, I don't mind. The graphics in Civilization V were definitely more realistic than they are in Civilization VI. This doesn't particularly bother me, I don't mind how the graphics look. If anything, the graphics look quite nice. If it bothers you, then consider everything else in the game before you decide to not buy it.\n\n+-AI. The AI in the game is okay. The only reason that the AI isn't a negative for me is because I like that they have agendas and the gossip features and how they react to some things that you do. After watching the AI match and reading peoples' complaints, it looks like the AI has multiple issues, like the placement of districts and expanding their civilization. The AI would also declare war and then make a peace treaty soon after. There were pillaged tiles and sitting units for most of the game. These things don't particularly bother me. I can still play a game fine with these issues but it looks like it really riles people up.\n\n+-Few glitches at launch. From launch, the game has very few glitches. However, here are some which I have enoucntered. Mousing over the messages which appear on the right of the screen as they did in the previous game does not always reveal what the message is. You need to fiddle with your mouse a bit for it to finally show. Also, meeting a new city-state has three separate messages and it would be nice if they were incorporated into one to unclutter the screen. The game does have a system of making multiple messages into one. It should do this for these city state messages.\n\n-Amenities, housing and others. Although it can be fun to micromanage these small additions, it feels more like Cities: Skylines than Civilization in this respect.

This had potential to make games more complex, as it would allow you to form alliances that catered to your goal, and the goals of the AI.\n\nIn practice, the system is horribly done.

That's weird\n\nTurn 4: Vikings: \"Your navy is s***, we denounce you!\"\n\nTurn 7: Vikings: \"Your navy is still s***, we declare war\"\n\nYou then spend about 20 turns at war, taking some cities\n\nTurn 28: All other AI \"Warmonger.

Civ 6 is a fantastic 4x game that in my opinion is an improvement on civ 5. However, there is one caveat. The two main DLCs are essential for the game to be great (not the frontier pass). I highly suggest you wait for a sale to pick up the game with the DLCs for the best experience. If you are on a budget and can't get the DLC, just buy civ v with the DLC (pretty cheap, since game is old) as that is a better experience than base civ 6. But with the DLC, the mechanics and turn to turn decisions are a huge improvement, even rising above civ v + DLC. If you are a civ v veteran, give this game a try with an open mind, its going be different, but once you learn the mechanics you will fall in love with the game. A lot of civ v players hate districts at first, but once you understand them and learn how to play with them, you will find that you will probably actually prefer the district system.

At least not yet.\n\nWhat did I like:\n - refreshed government types (early goverment types unlock very few benefits, later ones more and more) - think \"they replaced Policies with it\"),\n - interesting City District mechanics (still didn't fully wrap my head around it, but I only played 20h or so), making Cities physically large, occupying 10+ hexes),\n - trade routes now establish roads automatically (oh, and wokers now \"expire\" after few uses so you only use them to build farms/mines/etc but not roads),\n - Corps/Fleet idea (you can join 2-3 units of same type to create a stronger version with bigger punch; useful if you're hopelessly outgunned by tech-superior opponent, your swordsmen against his riflemen).\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n - cartoonish graphics (I realize developers want to introduce 12yo's to this game, but they clearly forgot about veteran gamers), especially irritating on diplomacy screens, I don't think I will ever get used to it,\n - seems it's made for tablets, not PCs (aforementioned graphics, everything is click-click-click - not much of keyboard control),\n - reports are clunky compared to Civ5 (try to list all your military units, to see if they need upgrading etc, I dare you; try to easily see which of your cities has most production/science/...),\n - diplomacy is a joke; while I like Cassus Belli (a \"reason\" to start a war to minimize your warmongering score) it's only the player needs it, AI will be constantly starting wars with you, even if moment ago they were showing smily face (icon representing your standing with them), and then when you pummel them to dust (hey, they started!) all other AIs will start hating you for warmongering,\n - oh, and they will be denouncing you every 5 turns or so, and that's the video sequence you have to wait through (and THEN click \"OK, done\"), making turns longer and longer (the \"denounce\" is used by players to start wars; it's not really used by AI for nothing else)\n - not to mention that scary Gilgamesh looks like a Asterix-or-Obelix cartoon. He was my friend for ages, and then he hated me, and then my \"free weekend\" expired to I couldn't put him to his Disney-like grave.\n\nWhat is interesting but needs improving:\n - the Eureka system. Great idea (\"if you use archers all the time for war, it should be much easier for you to develop crossbows\"), but flawed execution. Some Eurekas are triggered by luck (\"find a natural wonder to speed up research on X\"), some by something-way-too-easy (\"build a Niter mine to speed up research on Rifling, 3 or 4 eras (!) ahead of you\"), and some are just insane (\"build 3 units of this brand new thing to speed up following research\", where research takes 30 turns, and building that brand new unit takes 25 turns),\n - new World Wonders; some are overpowered (Big Ben!), some are useless (\"Chicken\" Itza it's now just that, it just improves jungle tiles in this single city alone and takes 80+ turns to build, WTF?).\n\nI know DLCs change the game.

So its doing something right at least. However even with all its greatness I have to not recommend it at this time. Civ 6 has a few issues that are infuriating to the point I did not want to play the game anymore even when I felt the \"One more turn\" urge to keep playing.\n\nFirst the changes that made me love Civ 6;\n\n-Art style: I actually like the style, especially the map fog which I assume everyone likes.\n-Barbarians: Holy jebus they can actually be a challange to deal with. Even late game when you least expect it.\n-Districts/Wonder Placement: Actually make city placement and specialization more thought provoking and fun.\n-Tech/Culture Eureka/Inspiration: Another good feature that can effect your gameplay style of a game.\n-Great Persons: if you want em you gotta go after them vigorously. And they range from \"Oh neat\" to \"HOLY SHIT THATS AWESOME\"\n-Various other things but here comes the long rant...\n\nNow the things that made me wonder what I was doing with my life playing Civ 6 (Mostly AI related);\n\n-UI/Infromation: So much detailed information is just GONE from Civ 5. You gotta memorize your luxurious resource trade deals because the game will not tell you how many you had in total or who you traded it to/from. You have no clue how well religion is spreading. You cannot look at Units special abilities. Combat Numbers do not accurately indicate the amount of damage your unit will deal. You have no way to look at deal historys with other civs. the \"Gossips\" tell you everything you don't need to know, from england building a granary to your civ trading with another civ the turn you setup a trade deal.\n\n-AI Agendas/Diplomacy: First off, the Agenda system is not a bad \"Idea\" its just the AI does not execute it correctly in relation to diplomacy and AI Insanity. Bottom line, if you are doing well, they will hate you, leading to all the AI denouncing eachother as well. If you manage to find ONE AI that tolerates you enough to become an Ally, they will do everything in their power to not be your friend/ally behind the scenes. Like declaring war on you for no reason.\n\n-Ai Combat Tactics/Peace terms: Speaking of declaring war, the AI are so bad at tactical combat that the Barbarians can wipe them out given the minor opportunity. They tend to fall behind in higher Tech Units because they don't upgrade their units usually. Also I think they were either programed to be complete panzies or their military command give out their orders in different languages to each unit. Because 90% of the time they will not attack anything in melee unless they can one shot it. If their HP drops to 60% that unit will run away. This leads them to just shuffle outside completly outmatched cities with a single archer able to fend off 10-15 units by himself without them even attacking the city. then the AI goes pants on head retarded and decides all hope is lost and will give you EVERYTHING they own for peace.\n\n-AI General AI Batshit insanity: The AI in Civ 6 are more akin to an Alien then a human player because they act insanely random. I would say they act like Civ 5 Ghandi but at least he was predictable with his madness. \"We have been best friends for thousands of years sharing trade and tech-DECLARES WAR ON YOU\" \"Wanna do a joint war against this Warmongering prick burning down my cities? YOU ARE A WARMONGERER!\" They are such massive hypocrites like the Joint War example. EVERYTHING they ask you to stop doing, They are currently doing to you but x10, Units near borders in particular even if its a single unit 2 tiles away in your own goddamn territory while they have a massive army IN your borders.\n\n-War, War Never Changes, (Except it does for the worse): War in Civ 6 is now a huge pain in the ass because unless you declare war on people within 20 turns of the game, WARMONGERING. even the casus belli's do nothing to change this (Except Liberation wars which never happen because nobody likes you), the \"Severity\" of Warmongering penalties translate to \"How long they will hate my guts\" not \"How much they will hate my guts\" so no matter how justified your war is, everyone will denounce you for declaring war on anyone, even the people who joined the war with you. Because you are a heartless bastard marching your forces to go punch that genocidal civililization in the face, who kick puppies for fun. Next on the agenda of war is \"War Weariness\" this as a good mechanic that falls off the mark due to its execution. Because yes it makes it so you cannot just be at war forever and kill everyone. But it screws over the AI while it forces the player in the late game to keep wars in short increments or have all your cities get pissy. This screws over the defender/AI because War Weariness skyrockets in cities being fought around. probably why the AI caves and throws everything they have at you, I've sieged a city and within 2-3 turns barbarians spawned around it and it turned into a 3-way fight.\n\n-Last but not least, PACING: The games pace is so wrong, without rushing science you will have nukes by the Napoleonic Era. Epic game speed is the old standard speed. You will never stay long enough in one era to enjoy it. Finally once you hit the Atomic Era the game speed kicks into high gear rushing the game into a suddon stop. You will get the coolest tech and units 5 turns before you achieve a Science victory, possible to not even get them with a Culture victory.\n\nI've stopped playing my current game because of these problems which I desperately hope get patched or something as there is a game in here that I love. but I can't play it without feeling like I'm a cat chasing blind deaf and stupid mice to a finish line on the counter. sure there are many ways to get onto the counter and the mice \"could\" reach it. but one jumped off the counter, another pissed in my cat-bowl, the final one thought we were buddies then had a brain aneurysm and tried to bite me but had no teeth and just gnawed on me \n\nAnd before you say \"Raise the Difficulty.\" thats just tying rope to the mice to pull them towards the goal faster.

I'd say that as of now, if anyone is thinking of buying the game, just get Civ V for a fraction of the price and wait for some actually interesting DLC to be released for Civ VI, or maybe a really big sale. Full price is a joke right now...\n\nI played 380 hours of Civ V, and I loved it. I pre-ordered Civ VI as soon as it was announced. Whoops.\n\nWhile a couple (and no more than just a couple) of features were exciting and fun (such as the city districts), the majority of the game felt so, so similar to Civ V. My impressions were that it was essentially a nice mod for Civ V. No where near worth $60. I'm hoping some DLC will invigorate the game and change it up, but 8 months later and they've only released $25 of civilization/scenario packs. Which is also insulting, as these civilizations add nothing new to the game.\n\nOn top of only feeling like a modded Civ V, they didn't fix any of the major issues of Civ V - mainly, the crappy AI. If anything, they've made it worse by adding more reasons for the AI to randomly hate you. I've found that once a rival civilization hates you (which can start very early and for very little reason), it's just going to be all-out war for the rest of the game, with a few turns of peace scattered throughout. There's no respite. Not that you necessarily need it, as the AI is also stupid and incapable of conducting a proper war or assault. And then you get warmonger penalties, and so everyone else hates you as well. It takes the whole element of diplomacy out of the game.   \n\nThere are just so many cons to Civ VI, and only a couple of pros. The changes from Civ V are mostly aesthetic, which should never cost $60. I'm really hoping there'll be some REAL DLC coming soon to breathe some life back into the game.

Districts do nothing for me. They're goofy and make your cities not feel like cities. Trade routes are clunky and a constant annoyance, especially once you get to the Renaissance era and beyond. \n\nThe AI has annoying tendencies such as sudden deluges of denouncements / wars that come out of nowhere, presumably related to the difficulty setting. Nevermind that a far off nation has never encountered one of your units or you one of their's (except for that first explorer), and nevermind that they don't have the ability to travel across the planet to even engage you, seems like there's just some counter that says you should be at war with 4/10 nations bc of your difficulty setting. And then 30 turns later you make peace after no shots fired, they pay you and are happy with you again. \n\nYou blow through eras without being able to build any units from that era bc it took too long to build things from previous eras before you advanced to the next (regardless of whether you're going for a scientific victory or not). \n\nSean Bean is great, though.\n\nEdit: All right, I'll be retracting alot of what I said above. I still think districts are goofy, but tolerable. They revised whatever default behavior existed for trade route duration so even in the late game you're not just constantly reenabling trade routes (of course, it'd be a better UX if they just auto-reenabled but hey, still better). The AI is improved, the pacing is improved... I can actually realistically build at least one copy of everything in an era, regardless.

Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it.

I have waited till I got a good view on some of the things that can be adressed and improved upon.\nI will try to use screenshots if I am able but since I am writing this review when I came back from work, please excuse any typo's and other faults you come across.\n\nI loved civ 5 and was looking forward to this game a lot. Let me state that this is BY FAR the best [u] base[/u] release of a civilization itteration. many of you will remember CIV:BE, a game that I personally liked in all honesty.\n\nThere are quite a few things different from civ 5, they recommend that you use the tutorial if you are new to the game. ALthough it helps a little it doesn't explain how different mechanics work in the game.\n\nThey stated that they have put  a lot of work into the civilopedia. Personally I don't think that it is very helpfull, it gives base information about certain aspects of the game. I[u] highly[/u] recommend reading the darn manual :D It is a good read and a lot more helpfull than a civilopedia thingy.\n\n[u] [b] The game [/b] [/u]\n\nAs in all civ games you start with a settler and a warrior, the settler is used to found (start up) cities, now however there is one hell of a big thing to reconsider and that is the availabillity of fresh water.\nYou can use map overlays to let you show where the best spot is to found cities, the main rule, the more green, the better. Also different from past games, in order to have a harbor you do not need a coastal city, you can use a district to place one. More of that later.\n\n[u] [b] Research [/b] [/u]\nThe research is split into 2 groups, one for your basic research (as you are used to in civ 5) and one civics tree. Although I like the concept it is way to easy to advance in both trees. When you play the game you get them EUREKA moments. It is when you, for example, found a city near the water, that you get a boost (50 percent) of a particular science. This is just to powerfull and the sole reason I researched both trees before (LONG BEFORE) I won the game. This needs to be adressed but for new players this will be helpfull because it makes the game easier.\n\n[u] [b] Artificial unintelligence [/b] [/u]\n\nThe AI in this game is better then CIV BE but thats not hard to accomplish, it simply isnt on par at the moment with what you would have expected after the heralds of wow moments of the online reviewers. \nAN example, I am in the atomic erra, one of the AI forces (let's say spain) declared war on me, rightfully so because I like to fight, a lot but my friends know that. SO he attacks me, with spearmen, crosbows and pikemen. SO no biggie, I have tanks and bombs, planes and helicopters. They lost, the game is so badly optimized for the AI that I was able to declare war on every singly faction and still won. The AI does [b] NOT [/b] upgrade the units they have, that's a shame.\n\n[u] [b] WAR, what is it goood for.... [/b] [/u]\nHere is another important change from civ 5, the community seems devided, I myself, am still not sure what I think of it.\n\nIn Civ 5 you had happiness, or you didnt had any because you took to many wars, here you have amenities. They take some time to get used to, in short you manage city per city and not glabally. In every city you have amenities, they can come from luxaries (spice and diamonds and things like that) or constructions and wonders, you must be made aware that the more cities you have, the harder it is to get the cities in a happy state.\nThe resources (as I have come to understand it, I may be wrong) is that of every resource you get 4 quantities and no more, so the 5th city will need a different resource to make them happy. It is hard to explain but once you play the game it becomes clearish.\nNow, what I do for dominination victory (you need all capitals for the win) is to raze cities that are NOT important to me, you will NEED to do this when you capture the city because you cant raze a city 5 turns later, thats a huge difference and I like to compare this to civ 4. You can not raze cities that have been capitals.\n\n[h1] Builder formally know as Worker [/h1]\n[b] Edited with the help of Iskandar Udaijin vi Brittania [/b]\n\n[b] The maximum amount of charges if you are not China is actually 6 (pyramids + certain economic policy), and as China the maximum number is 7. [/b]\n\nThey kinda work the same as in civ 5 but not completely, if you choose a work for them to do (mining, farming etc) they do it INSTANTLY. They can do it (for most civilizations) 3 times at the start of t he game, this can be improved with research later on, I think a max is 5 charges?\nOnce the chargers are used up, the unit dissapears, everytime you use a charge one man will be shown less than a fully charged unit 3 -->2 ---->1 and then nada\n\n[u] [b] Units [/b] [/u]\n\nThey have added a lot of new units and still I think they could have done more. With research you can now link up to 3 units of the same type in armies (land units) or armada's (sea units)\nThey show this with stars in the shield of the unit. I wish they would have used a different method, one artilliry is one unit and if you link a second artilliry, in my opinion, it should have been visualized as 2 artilleries and then one more for 3 units. Now you get the same representation, one unit but if it is an army, yay, you get 3 stars in its shield. But for the UPT haters this is a nice middleway.

You'll build exactly three Crossbow Men, you'll always found at least one coastal city, and you'll always go around trying to maximize your boosts.\n  Contrast this with Civ 5, where I'd usually find myself in a sticky situation when I focused too much on buildings, and there could be Civs without access to water.

The fact that wonders now take up a tile slot adds to this, and the result is that turtling isn't as effective a strategy anymore and one city can't house literally 90% of the world's wonders. District management means planning is paramount.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\nThis game launched with few leaders, some of whom were near reskins of existing ones. Firaxis has decided that it's okay to ship the same civ with a different leader, which only changes [i]one[/i] of the unique characteristics of a civ, and call that differentiation. The game is also unbalanced. If you don't have DLC, you will always square off against either Sumeria or Scythia in the late-game, because they are extremely powerful civs. If you [i]do[/i] have DLC, you will face whatever civ is a DLC civ.\n\nEach game feels hardly different than any other because the civ variety is so low. Each game feels like you're fighting the same seven enemies with the same two always coming out on top.\n\n[b]The Ugly[/b]\n\nCiv VI employs a predatory system of DLC release. DLC civs are objectively more powerful than base-civs, making Civ VI essentially pay-to-win. A [b]single civ[/b] will cost you $5 since it comes bundled with a bunch of useless crap like scenario packs that you'll never play. FURTHERMORE, and this deserves its own paragraph:\n\n-----\n\n[h1]Sid Meyer's Civilization VI frequently encounters frustrating crashes with ANY form of Workshop DLC, INCLUDING UI mods. [/h1]\n\n-----\n\nYou'll notice that my profile has ~99 hours of gameplay in Civ VI. At least 5 of that is just bug fixing. Here is a list of bugs I have had that is in no way complete, but what I can remember off my head:\n\n* Crashing from launch screen\n* Build/Culture/Bottom-Right button not working at all\n* Units not moving to the space I click on\n* Almost every single patch to this game will require you to not only disable, but UNINSTALL FROM THE FILE FOLDER every single piece of Workshop DLC content you have ever downloaded, and chances are you still won't be able to use DLC content even with a reinstallation.\n* Unit icons not displaying\n\nAnd lastly, the single most ugly thing about this entire game, worse even than the frequent crashes, predatory DLC policy, and inability to use Workshop content:\n\n[h1]After an entire year and two major updates, this game does not have production queues.[/h1]\n\nEvery single time you complete a production, you need to do another. It's incredibly micro-intensive. \"But wait!\" I hear you say, \"I can just get a UI mod from the Workshop to fix that!\" To which I say, no, you can't. Civ VI won't run Workshop content without breaking instantly.\n\nGo buy Civ V.\n\nEdit: To those that are saying Endless Legend started the district system, they didn't-- at least not as it's used here.

Civ 6 does some things better than Civ 5, like for example the district system, the finished wonder animations, culture, great people, espionage and trade routes. Some things that I liked in Civ 5 are worse in civ 6, like statistics, map, A.I, resources and religion.\n\nOne thing that might be insignificant to you is the map showing owned water tiles as if they were land tiles. To me that is just a fun killer since I love looking at the map to see the empire I have created. In this system it just looks like a blob instead of an empire.\n\nThe A.I in Civilization 6 is pure garbage. In one game I played I had declared war ONCE in the entire game. One time in 354 turns (1932 A.D) and every single A.I denounced me for being a warmonger when I did it on like turn 100, and renewed their warmonger denouncements continualy through the rest of the game, despite me not starting a single war since then. I think this is why the A.I for some reason counts wars declared against you as you being a warmonger, which is just beyond stupid.\n- The A.I is also incapable of fighting human players. All I did to win every single war was to just sit there and do nothing until the A.I gave up. They send like one or two units into my land and that's it. I play on immortal difficulty.\n- The A.I mocked me by saying my economy was weak and that I would go bankrupt soon...I had the strongest economy in the game.\n- Diplomacy...\n\nI might be overly harsh on this game, but that is only because I have like 2.000 hours on Civ 5, and I'm making a lot of comparisons between Civ 6 and Civ 5.

Not until the issues with the AI mechanics have been truly addressed.\n\nCivilization is one of my absolute favorite game brands so I was naturally really excited about the Civilization VI and also preordered the game. The reason for my late review is that my laptop unfortunately broke fairly soon after the release and I was without a PC until only very recently. \n\nAfter around a hundred hours I've now reached the conclusion that this game has a few core issues in how the AI acts that make it extremely frustrating and hard for even the most open-minded player to fully enjoy the game. I've tried my very best to overcome the downsides for the sake of the many upsides and enjoy the game. However in the end I just can't overcome the main downside of the game. The graphical design is fantastic and the game packs with many welcomed ideas or enhancements like the districts and new wonder placement, day-night cycle, new city state mechanics and the beautiful drawn map.\n\nA major thing the Civilization V was lacking was a proper diplomacy and that's what Firaxis wanted to upgrade in the 6th installment of the series. The ending result was the idea being great but the implementation not that much. In this review I will focus on those few major points that keep me from recommending this game despite how much I love it otherwise.\n\nThe AI constantly denounces you for unrealistic reasons. A few of them being: \"your military is too weak\", \"you have so much that I do not\" (having one other luxury resource that the AI doesn't), \"you have accuired more great people than I have\", \"you have a different coverment policy than I have\" or \"you haven't spread your religion to my city yet\". It's absolutely frustrating when you try your best to be friendly with the AI but the relationship either starts right off negative or ends up going there very swiftly. In short the AI most of the time thinks and acts like a very close-minded pessimist.\n\nThe other negative aspect of the game goes hand-in-hand with the issue I mentioned above. All the AI Civilizations are more or less warmongers that seek any possibility to declare war on you. My \"best\" experience was when in a very early game (below turn 50) I met an AI and they immediately declared war on me. This was followed by every other AI in the game (3) declaring war on me one by one during the next couple of turns. Half of these AI's I had not even met yet. What makes the situation more absurd is that every time when you counter the attack of an AI who has declared war on you, the other AI's denounce YOU as a warmonger. \"The world shall know truth about you\". How does that make sense?\n\nThe recent Australia update supposedly came with minor adjustments and tuning for the AI as well but I honestly can't see much of an improvement. The core issues are still there. Instead of pushing out new DLC for the game I'd hope that Firaxis would patch the base game so it wouldn't feel so unfinished. It is no coincidence that this game has gotten really mixed reviews so far and as a new buyer I would hold my purchase for now. I will gladly change my rating later on when the issues with the AI mechanics have been addressed properly.

City states are also actually fun to interact with now, as they don't lose influence over time, and each one has a unique bonus that it provides, be it a unique tile improvement or resource boost or what have you.\n\nThe diplomatic screen is a little easier to navigate, allowing you to jump between other Civs without leaving that interface, which saves a lot of time.\n\nThe split research and cultural techs make for a fun dichotomy and all of the smaller actions that you can take to speed up research (or gain favor with city states) help to freshen up the gameplay without being overbearing, like the quest system from Beyond Earth.\n\nI like that they got creative with support units, such as healers that can help your units recover faster, or balloons that increase the range of your siege units.\n\nThe districts take a little getting used to, but they aren't as restrictive as I had thought that they would be. You just have to put down a series of similar buildings on one particular tile on the map, which adds a bit of extra strategy to maximize bonuses.

The new research system with inspirations granted from doing various tasks is a fantastic idea that should have been in the game a long time ago. The neutral cities giving quests that allow you to curry favour with them, and the resulting benefits, also makes that portion of the game much more worthwhile. Workers having limited charges makes them much more sensible, and with some mods, making them automated helps greatly in the late game.\n\nSo why the negative review?\n\nThree (four?) words.\n\nThe. AI. SUCKS.\n\nYou don't notice this early on, because you're too busy being amazed by all of the things they do right. But eventually, once the glamour wears off, it smacks you in the face. You realise that the AI literally can't do anything right. \n\nFirst it's the small things - like, when you're attacking a city, if the city has a unit fortified in it, it won't attack your attackers unless it has other units in the nearby attacking range. Even if the unit is ranged, it will just sit inside and wait, until another one shows up, before attacking.\n\nEventually, though, you start noticing that the AI doesn't actually even play the game. It just sits there and waits for you to react. It never attacks you, unless you're grossly under-defended. And when it attacks, it's painfully easy to wipe the attackers out.\n\nWhere it really kicks you in the nuts, though, is when you start playing on Emperor difficulty or greater. Read some of the guides online, and you'll realise that the harder difficulties don't actually make the AI better - it just lets the AI cheat. And the way to beat the AI on these harder difficulties, is to basically abuse mechanics as much as possible.\n\nHopefully they eventually fix the AI, because the game really is great. And if you're playing for multiplayer (which I'm not), it quite possibly could already be great.

Many things like that......\n\nOverall a very accomplished title in the series, yet one hopes the developers dont fall over each other trying to deliver a balanced consensus of a game as Civ Vi represents an evolution of the formula clearly taking inspirations from the feedback from the game and its players over time, lest it become contrived in its purposes and not find its roots in being a groundbreaking title.", "timestamp_created": 1703854709, "timestamp_updated": 1703856737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.854345500469207764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "159003993": {"recommendationid": "159003993", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999362425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 148373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "playtime_at_review": 148223, "last_played": 1708749505}, "language": "english", "review": "Just one more turn......", "timestamp_created": 1708636320, "timestamp_updated": 1708636320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85217660665512085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148748386": {"recommendationid": "148748386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020818677", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 8884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 216, "playtime_at_review": 7537, "last_played": 1709339881}, "language": "english", "review": "A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best.
