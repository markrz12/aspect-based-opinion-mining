I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\"", "timestamp_created": 1676401383, "timestamp_updated": 1676401383,

This game, my friends, is a true masterpiece - a magnum opus of undead-slaying madness that has forever changed the way we view zombie games.\n\nFrom the moment I started, I was hooked. The graphics, the sound, the gameplay - it all came together in a symphony of blood, guts, and glory that left me breathless. The attention to detail is simply unparalleled - every zombie, every weapon, every level is crafted with a precision and care that can only come from a team of dedicated professionals who truly love what they do.\n\nBut what sets Left 4 Dead 2 apart from other zombie games is the sheer intensity of the experience. The hordes of undead that come at you from all directions, the heart-stopping crescendo events, the adrenaline-fueled escapes - it all adds up to a thrill ride unlike anything else in gaming. And let's not forget the special infected - the jockey, the smoker, the hunter - each one a unique and terrifying threat that keeps you on your toes and constantly on the lookout for danger.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest aspect of Left 4 Dead 2 is its cooperative gameplay. This is a game that truly shines when played with friends - the teamwork, the coordination, the sheer joy of surviving together against all odds. And with so many different game modes and levels to choose from, the replay value is off the charts.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is simply the best zombie game ever made. It is a masterpiece of gaming that combines stunning visuals, pulse-pounding action, and cooperative gameplay to create an experience that is both thrilling and unforgettable. If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favour and join the fight against the undead - you won't regret it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1679865094, "timestamp_updated": 1679865094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834364056587219238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145408531": {"recommendationid": "145408531", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206287751", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2450, "last_played": 1690273676}, "language": "english", "review": "pills here", "timestamp_created": 1693521504, "timestamp_updated": 1693521504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827040135860443115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131951676": {"recommendationid": "131951676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169768169", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 2945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2945, "last_played": 1675183214}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not entirely sure if it is a game that you can run with mods or mods that you can run with a game.", "timestamp_created": 1675184500, "timestamp_updated": 1675184500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825027287006378174", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146422137": {"recommendationid": "146422137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198981292549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1695165926}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend who I play Left 4 Dead 2 with said if I post a review on the game and it gets 100 likes and 50 Awards that he will buy me a rack of beer and some vodka.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The special infected act as a handicap for the player, which creates a real sense of dependency: you must rely on your teammates to help you out in any predicament. The friendly fire strongly encourages players to place their shots carefully and to not mindlessly play the game.\n\nLevel design is top notch with incredible environmental storytelling, pretty open spaces, and the survival horror elements provide incentive for exploration. The physical interactivity of the environment makes any encounter with infected visually impressive and satisfying. \n\nThe lack of skill trees, progression, etc. makes Left 4 Dead 2 incredibly timeless, as you can hop back into the game ten years from now and play at no disadvantage to other players. The skills and strategies you learn will stay with you by the time you return to the game in ten years. Simplicity is a strength of Left 4 Dead 2's gameplay. \n\nThe pacing of the action is expertly done, allowing the players to enjoy moments of respite after a sudden horde. The game knows how to keep the moment to moment gameplay from feeling repetitive. The moments of respite also serve as opportunities for exploration, which is great. A multiplayer game that balances the action and the exploration is simply fantastic. The game is at its best when the audio cues suggest to the players that a horde is coming, and everyone scrambles to find a spot to hold up in and prepare for the onslaught, building tension as players await their possible demise.", "timestamp_created": 1683845038, "timestamp_updated": 1683845038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727074027061462402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136707299": {"recommendationid": "136707299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004608371", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1692619180}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

I would highly recommend playing versus, but do not let the toxic players get to you and try to play with friends. \n\nAs for an achievement run, its a good experience and there are really only 2-3 nearly impossible achievements which include a christmas achievement in versus, a free weekend achievement which seems to only happen every few years, and an achievement to play with someone who got the game for free in 2013. Besides this every achievement is completely possible in 2023 and are either incredibly easy to get or may at the very most just require some workshop content (mutations help a lot too for some). I cheesed as little as possible but for example the gold survival medals on all 43 maps is a little tedious without Raymans horde mode. This is because survival is not a fun experience especially when you are alone since there are fewer players, survival players mainly just play a small handful of the total maps, and then you have to also make it to 10 mins which without hordes is a task and a half to do unless you're some survival pro. \n\nAll in all 9.5/10, would highly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1692707866, "timestamp_updated": 1692707866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676985204219818115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137147832": {"recommendationid": "137147832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401947619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6039, "last_played": 1695129793}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice to play with friends", "timestamp_created": 1682217056, "timestamp_updated": 1682217056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675502657890319824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146896990": {"recommendationid": "146896990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215543289", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1693065282}, "language": "english", "review": "My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on left 4 dead 2 and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.", "timestamp_created": 1695514672, "timestamp_updated": 1695514672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674572408199310303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128321309": {"recommendationid": "128321309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071921317", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 6869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6869, "last_played": 1670709698}, "language": "english", "review": "Coming back to this feels good.

I am a father to my 15 children, ranging from ages 3 to 40. My 37 year old son recently started Left 4 Dead 2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 200 hours. This was amazing for me, as it was already hard enough for me to avoid spending time with my insufferable offspring. All they care for these days is recording them TikTok dances, collecting Funko Pops and scrolling Instagram.\n\nInspired by seeing him having a reason to stop coming out of the basement to ask for more junk food, I decided to try it myself. I loaded into the game, smashed some buttons but I was stuck on what I was supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. As soon as we loaded in, he immediately started shouting unintelligible commands at me through his rainbow flashing headset like \"CAMP THE SPAWN!\" and \"POP SOME PILLS AND MOLLY THAT TANK!\" Every time I messed up, which was always, he would call me names like noob and filthy casual.\n\nThe horde of zombies descending upon our characters was reminiscent of the swarm of children I had unwittingly spawned into this world. I have never felt more confused and upset in my decades of fatherhood. This was the worst time I had spent with my son since his mother had that mid-life crisis.\n\nThis game has ever since driven my son and I apart again and now we actually spend even less time together.

For Valve, Left 4 Dead 2 represents an unusually speedy turnaround time considering the delays and release date fuzziness generally associated with its games, notably in the years leading up to Team Fortress 2 and the still mysterious status of Half-Life 2: Episode 3. Despite that history and the potential concerns associated with how soon this game is showing up after the first, Left 4 Dead 2 is very much a complete game, much more so than the original, and is without a doubt the better product. If you're still in the mood to group up with friends and slay packs of ravenous undead, then it doesn't get any better than this. However, if you're tired of Left 4 Dead's gameplay formula, the sequel, as good as it is, may not be enough to warrant a purchase. It's a game that's more about refinement and augmentation of existing features instead of offering something dramatically new.\n\nAs a result, after you've played Left 4 Dead 2, it's difficult to go back to the original without a mild sense of disappointment. Remember, of Left 4 Dead's four original campaigns, only two were set up for Versus play right out of the gate. It wasn't until Valve released the Survival Pack months later that players got the full Versus experience as well as the now-standard timed Survival mode. Left 4 Dead 2 has five full and more interesting campaigns, a more fleshed out and distinctive setting with some fantastic action set pieces, more personality, more modes, and in general gives you more to do. In many ways, I wish this would have been the product that was released first since it feels much more full-featured than the original, and the fiercely team-oriented style of gameplay wouldn't have been as familiar then as it is now.\n\nIt's entirely possible you're someone who never played the first and have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll take a step back for a moment. It's the zombie apocalypse, and you play as one of four human Survivors who attempt to shoot their way through hordes of fast-moving \"infected\" (which I'll refer to as zombies) to get to the end of a map. The sequel is set in the American southeast and the new cast of characters is more memorable this time around, as they seem more aware of their situation, chattering away and commenting on specific parts of the environment as they battle through. Ellis' inane stories while huddled in safe houses are a particular highlight as he waxes on about accident-prone acquaintances while mobs of bloodthirsty zombies converge on his position, at which point the others understandably tell him to shut his mouth.\n\n\nThat's not what you should be doing while playing, however. More effectively than most other titles out there, Left 4 Dead 2 forces you to work as a team if you want to win. You need to talk, and you need to participate. Every member of your four person squad of Survivors needs to be communicating about what they're doing, calling out locations for ammunition, weapon, and health pickups, and asking for help when in trouble. The catch is that no stage ever plays out the same way, because there's an artificial intelligence called the Director governing the action. Packs of common zombies can attack at any time, and if what the Director throws at you proves too challenging, your path of progression through a stage may even get swapped around to make things easier. It makes every experience different, and encourages repeat play as it adapts to challenge players of any skill level.\n\n\nMORE ZOMBIE TYPES MAKE THE GAMEPLAY EVEN MORE UNPREDICTABLE.\n\nLike before, there are multiple difficulty settings, with Normal serving as a good entry-level challenge while on Expert only those with the best communication, decision-making, and reaction skills will survive. Left 4 Dead 2's Realism mode makes the challenge even more daunting, removing helpful glows around items and weapons amongst other things, meaning it's all up to your communication skills to call out ammunition and item pickups or to let people know you're in trouble. If you're the type of player who generally shies away from a conversation and prefers to remain silent, then you're not going to like Left 4 Dead, mostly because your team isn't going to do very well if everyone's only interacting on a minimal level. Because of how much teamwork is required in Left 4 Dead, it's also one of the best games out there for triggering an emotional response in players, which works both ways. If you manage to pull through, you feel a much greater sense of accomplishment, and if you're losing, it can be singularly frustrating since your success is just as reliant on the behavior of those around you as it is on your own personal skill.\n\nBots are still included, though, so if you do want to run through the five campaigns by yourself that's entirely possible, and should a person have to drop out midway through a campaign, an artificial intelligence will take over so you don't have to all give up. Your computer-controlled teammates will work alongside, making accurate shots, swapping out weapons, reviving, trading items and healing when necessary. It's nowhere close to as entertaining an experience, but it's still functional and playable solo. Ideally, like when preparing for a dungeon run in an MMO, you'll be able to get a full party together to tackle the challenges, and it's an experience that's at its best when in a full Versus game.\n\nVersus is also where you'll be challenged the most, as four players will be running through as Survivors and four others controlling the powerful boss zombie types. These include the Tanks, Boomers, Smokers, and Hunters from the first game, in addition to the new Spitters, Jockeys, and Chargers. The new boss zombie special powers add layers to the gameplay, such as the Spitter's acid pool that can do heavy damage over time to anyone who stumbles into it. The Jockey's ability to take over control of a Survivor's direction of movement makes for even more interesting combination possibilities here, and overall the addition of these new boss zombies adds in a welcome amount of depth and, if you're playing as Survivors, unpredictability to the play experience. If your Infected team is working together you can time Boomer bile attacks with Jockey jumps and Spitter attacks so large groups of common zombies are attacking while one Survivor stumbles under a Jockey's control and the rest are slowly dying in a pool of acid.\n\nThese kinds of team tactics are subject to further refinement when you take into account the campaign-specific challenges, some of which are sure to get your pulse pounding. To be perfectly clear, this is not a relaxing game. You're tense and fixated on the screen at all moments, and during sequences like the rollercoaster race in the Dark Carnival campaign and the storming and flooding of the second half of Hard Rain, you'll need to pay even closer attention. The campaigns here include exciting crescendo events and defense sequences that any hardcore Left 4 Dead fan is going to go absolutely nuts over. In that sense, if you're still playing Left 4 Dead and are looking for more, then you're going to love this product.\n\nIt's not just the better campaigns, the more fully-realized and detailed environments and the switch from the dark city streets of the first game to the bogs, carnival grounds, marshes, and sunlit construction yards that contribute to reasons why this is a better game. There's also a wealth of little things that make this a sturdier, more complex, and more entertaining experience. You'll find scattered around rooms incendiary and explosive ammunition pickups for all to enjoy, a wider range of rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and sniper rifles to pick apart your opposition (though many of the like weapons models behave similarly), and perhaps most importantly of all, in Left 4 Dead 2 you can take advantage of melee weapons.", "timestamp_created": 1674062575, "timestamp_updated": 1674062575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612098276615142822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131070464": {"recommendationid": "131070464", "author": {"steamid": "76561199209768550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5669, "last_played": 1690875379}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best old game which gave me fun^-^", "timestamp_created": 1674020764, "timestamp_updated": 1674020764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607821941375732422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140349420": {"recommendationid": "140349420", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002288330", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2440, "last_played": 1687822189}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a new player.

Developed and published by Valve Corporation, the game features hordes of zombies and other creatures that players must fight their way through in order to survive.\n\n-What I love about this game is how it encourages teamwork and communication, something that most gamers are not exactly known for. If you're not communicating with your fellow survivors, you're going to end up as zombie chow. And trust me, there's nothing worse than being eaten alive while your teammates are busy looting the nearest convenience store.\n\n-The graphics and sound design are top-notch, but what really sets Left 4 Dead 2 apart is its sense of humor. The game is filled with hilarious one-liners and pop culture references, such as when Coach, one of the playable characters, says \"I'm gonna mess up some zombies like it's prom night!\" How can you not laugh at that?\n\n-One downside of the game is that it can get a bit repetitive after a while. Fighting through waves of zombies can start to feel like a chore after a few hours of gameplay.

Solo players and jerks stay out, its not for you. You'll have a bad time. Oh, you're actually gonna read my rambling review? :o Well thank you. I will be blunt and honest. Its never gone badly for me before, heh... :/\n\n*Look at me, I'm a speedrunner! Watch me rush! Trust me guys, I... Oh, revive me, I got rayg- 'You have been kicked.'*\n\nLet me start this off by saying something. Its not for solo play. if you don't like dealing with or working with others, you're NOT gonna like this. You wanna go lone wolf, or go Rambo? Then you'll get carved by a Hunter like you are a suckling pig at a Pegan banquet, or worse, learn why the Jockey is considered the contribution by Valve to ruining everyone's day. That said, alot of people say if you have no friends, don't bother either. Well, this is a good place to make some! :D\n\nYou can get decent pick up groups and randos for this game, in all honesty 80% are kind, patient, and have a good sense of humor and fair skills. And the other 18%, are at least civil and acceptable. But the 2%, that's the bad apples that spoils the bunch. That's the fly in the ointment of this game. Block those people, and try to 'collect' people as I do, ones that are fun and cooperative, and you should be fine. Just do not expect a flawless cruise. But, moving on from that?\n\n*Look out! Weebery ahead! Mods galore!*\nIt's very, very fun. Holds up far better then any 13 year old game should. And Its not so much Valve's support (More on that soon enough, I need to grind that axe to a fine edge....) that has kept the game thriving, that's the dedicated playerbase. THOUSANDS, of mods and addons on the Workshop, have had people always coming back, all the wonders, and horrors you can imagine await your perusal.\n\nWant weeb trash anime characters replacing your survivors? Hold onto your pocky, there is a flood of that for ya. Are you a perv? Holy Rule 34, you're all set there amigo. >.> Or maybe you just wanna have chaos. Shrek Tanks, Sanic Hunters, Gabe Boomers, kittens as the commons...? Todd Howard Witches, Teletubbies as commons, Mountain Dew as pills, Windows start up noises for the defib? Let it be done. Maybe something respectable, practical even? HD reworks, enhancements, new weapons, new maps, with scripts even? Psh, normie. But you're set there too. People will dazzle and impress you with their modding skills with all you can hope for. Just be wary, not all test their mods or put in due effort, and some mods really do not play well with others, so test thoroughly in single player before going out in the wild.\n\n*It's an older game sir, but it checks out... I was about to play it.*\n\nLets see, what else to note... The games old, even with the Last Stand update (An officially supported add on for a game over 10 years old!? I know, and its great, I love it, people just hate it cause it disrupted a TON of mods...) So any potato rig should be able to run it if you don't overstuff it with mods like a kid unattended at Build a Bear. But lets get into the nitty gritty, brass tacks and all. Lets be honest, the game is lovely, but it has its flaws.\n\nAs stated from the outset, its not just the bad eggs you are wanting to not play the game solo for, its the bots. The AI controlled survivors. They are mind-numbingly incompetent, truly a marvel of how not to program. Watch any compilation on Youtube and you'll easily see what I mean. Misuse of healing supplies, lack of prioritization when healing or assisting you, or even each other, and their slow clumsy attempts to evade a tank, or god forbid freeing you from a Jockey or a Smoker in a timely manner, critical during horde events or on expert where 1-2 tics of damage mean ALOT.\n\nIts not all bad, seeing as how they have magic bullets incapable of friendly fire, are immune to bile blindness, able to revive you even when you are getting mob rushed and stomped on like a Youtube comment section, (That is when they get around to helping you up and not letting themselves be an easy target for any enterprising special infected) they are even able to kill infected you cannot see, often in trees or behind cover. They also are unable to startle witches with gunfire, in a blatant showing of favoritism on her part I might add, or start evadable events like car alarms. For these reasons, 1 bot is actually rather helpful, if you geniuses can pick up its slack.\n\n*You were the chosen one! It was said you would support the game, not leave it in darkness! You were my brother Gaben, I loved you...*\n\nYeah, here it is, my gripefest. Strap yourselves in, excess sodium incoming. Besides giving modders and fans their blessing by allowing an update, Valve has been like a father who tried at first, then left for some milk and never came back, besides now and then scratching up a check for alimony that you aren't sure will bounce or not. The official addons for the games, vary in quality, The Passing and Sacrifice being good, And Crash Course being... Not. And all are a bit short, 2-3 chapters in length. If you play on expert you might get your moneys worth (Just an expression, this game is like 5, maybe 10 dollars usually, and the DLC has always been free, except on Xbox, poor devils) but most clear them fast and hunger for more. And a quick tangent, Xbox Players really got the stiff one here, no last stand update? No fixes that we managed to get, no new weapons, no new campaign, no new unused dialogue? What a crock of crap. For shame, Valve. Way to make those Console Peasants feel second class.\n\nIts been said they were designed for more intensive Versus play, but some like myself don't like Versus. it's honestly where alot of negativity in this game stems from. Disgusting sprays, toxic and downright elitest behavior, tons of unwritten rules and expectations, I am sure most are kind and just wanna play a fun game, but most the antics and vile conduct and content, is there.\n\nBesides some... debatable effort offered in the DLCs, there is evidence to this day of Valve's unfortunate abandonment of their game. Annoying bugs left for years for their fans to fix, some are just in the very framework and engine itself. And mind boggling lack of foresight, such as why can't I BLOCK PEOPLE FROM JOINING MY GAME!? Good god, why can't I do that? People can jump, over, and over, and OVER, into your game that you kick out. There is no 3 strike rule, there is no 'kicked from this game, no entry' check. Nothing. It's insanity, even in the developmental commentary they stated you can walk through survivors partially to avoid griefing, yet they didn't think there would be teamkillers or jerks and have a solid way to keep them kicked out? That's idiotic nonsense, very incompetent and unprofessional of a ground breaking studio with 10+ years of excellent games at the time of its release, and the fact to this day there is no recourse short of a private server, is even more insulting.\n\nSo yeah, games good, not perfect, but great stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1666187658, "timestamp_updated": 1666187658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550408720970153809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146126090": {"recommendationid": "146126090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383256195", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3324, "last_played": 1692683971}, "language": "english", "review": "One time, the Army bombed my buddy Keith.

Oops! In Left 4 Dead 2, teamwork is vital, but so is friendly fire. It's a delicate balance between \"I've got your back!\" and \"Watch out, I've got a grenade launcher!\"\n\nFrom chainsaw massacres to hilariously bad attempts at survival, Left 4 Dead 2 turns the zombie apocalypse into a sidesplitting comedy of errors. So grab your cricket bat, duct-tape some defibrillators together, and get ready for some undead laughs \u2013 because in this game, the real monster is your friend with the grenade launcher!",

And if that sounds stressful, don't worry! You can always blow off some steam by shooting your teammates in the back.\n\nBut what really makes Left 4 Dead 2 special is the variety of zombie types. From the classic slow-moving zombies to the speedy \"Witch\" who will rip you to shreds, each enemy provides a unique challenge.\n\nAnd let's not forget the special infected, like the spitter who pukes acid all over you, or the jockey who jumps on your head and steers you into danger. These guys are like the Kardashians of the zombie world \u2013 you don't want to mess with them.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a fun, fast-paced shooter that will keep you on the edge of your seat (or your couch, if you're playing on console). Just don't forget to bring some friends, because no one wants to face the zombie apocalypse alone.

Despite the involvement of Left 4 Dead developers from Turtle Rock Studios, the game has not lived up to expectations and has fallen short. On the other hand, Left 4 Dead 2 has been around for 14 years and continues to be popular and engaging, thanks in part to its active Steam Workshop community. Rant aside, If you prefer Back 4 Blood, that's fine, but Left 4 Dead 2 offers a more comprehensive gaming experience at a more affordable price point ($15 AUD compared to $90 AUD).[/i]\n\n[h2] Actual Review [/h2]\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter game that offers players an immersive and challenging gaming experience. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a zombie outbreak has occurred, and players take on the role of one of four survivors, each with their own unique abilities and personalities.\n\n[h2] Pros and cons [/h2]\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] \ud83d\udfe9 Positives [/th]\n[th] \ud83d\udfe5 Negatives [/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]\n- Engaging gameplay that is easy to pick up but hard to master\n\n- Distinctive art style that has aged well over time\n\n- Diverse range of special zombie types that add extra challenge and excitement to gameplay\n\n- Extensive Steam Workshop content that ensures there is always something new to experience\n\n- Strong AI that adapts to players' strategies and keeps the game feeling fresh\n\t[/td]\n\t[td]\n- Can be frustrating to play with uncooperative or inexperienced teammates\n\n- Limited replayability for players who are not interested in using the Steam Workshop content\n\n- [i] It gets lonely when you have no friends ;( [/i]\n\t[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\t\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nIn terms of story, Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't have a strong narrative, and the story is mostly told through the game's environments and characters rather than cutscenes or dialogue. However, the game's setting and atmosphere are well done and make the player feel like they are actually in a zombie outbreak.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nOne of the key elements of the game's combat is the variety of zombies that players must face. The game includes a number of special infected, such as the Boomer, the Hunter, and the Smoker, each of which requires unique tactics to take down. This keeps the game challenging and requires players to think critically about how to approach each situation, making the game a real test of teamwork and strategic thinking.\n\nThe game features a wide range of firearms, from pistols to shotguns, as well as melee weapons like pipes and axes. Additionally, players can use environmental objects, such as propane tanks or gasoline cans, as improvised weapons to help fend off the zombies.\n\nAnother key aspect of Left 4 Dead 2's gameplay is its artificial intelligence Director, which adjusts the gameplay for each playthrough, keeping the game challenging and replayable. The Director ensures that players never experience the same game twice, providing a unique experience each time they play. The AI Director also keeps the difficulty level high, providing players with a real sense of danger and urgency as they fight their way through the hordes of zombies.\n\n[h3] Steam Workshop [/h3]\nThe Steam Workshop is an essential part of the game's longevity, as it provides players with new and creative content that helps to keep the game fresh and engaging. It also fosters a strong community of players who are passionate about the game, and it provides a platform for players to collaborate and share their ideas. By providing an endless stream of new and creative content, the Steam Workshop helps to ensure that Left 4 Dead 2 remains a popular and enjoyable game for years to come.\n\n[h2] Audio Design [/h2]\nOne aspect of the game that greatly contributes to player immersion is the use of musical cues when the special infected are nearby. These music cues serve as audio cues that help to alert players to the presence of the enemy and increase their sense of danger and urgency.\n\nThe musical cues are unique and memorable, and they are tailored specifically to each special infected. For example, the Hunter's music cue is fast-paced and intense, conveying the urgency of the situation and the danger posed by the Hunter. On the other hand, the Boomer's music cue is slow and ominous, building tension and suspense as the Boomer prepares to attack. These music cues are distinct and recognizable, even when playing with others, and they help to make each special infected feel like a unique and dangerous enemy.\n\nThe use of music cues in Left 4 Dead 2 is a critical aspect of the game's audio design, and it plays a significant role in enhancing player immersion. By providing audio cues that are easy to recognize, the game helps to increase player engagement and build a more immersive and believable game world. The music cues also help to increase the sense of tension and urgency, adding to the overall challenge and excitement of the game.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 is an absolute must-play for fans of the cooperative shooter genre.

There are a few things that have been downgraded from the first game, like the infinite shove, they nerfed shoving and gave it a cool down to justify the existence of melee weapons, which is not necessarily a bad thing, the first game has 2 different reload animations for guns but they reduced it to 1 in the second game.

Half-Life and its sequels, the Portal duology, and Counter-Strike are absolutely revolutionary games that shook up the status quo for first-person shooters. The original Left 4 Dead was a must-buy when it came out. Against all odds, L4D2 stands above them all as a lovingly crafted, extremely replayable, and immensely enjoyable shooter. It's such a good cooperative experience that it inspired later games like Payday: The Heist and Back 4 Blood!\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is a co-op zombie FPS that pits you and 3 other friends against hordes of the Infected, mutated humans warped by a strange disease called the \"Green Flu.\" The plot is split between 4 survivors in Pennsylvania and 4 others in the American South, with each campaign telling a unique story of fighting through the Infected to (potentially) reach safety. This ranges from navigating to the top of an overrun city's hospital to trying to signal an evacuation chopper in an amusement park. Every character stands out with a distinct personality and quirks, like Louis's optimism or Nick's suspicion of everything around him. A lot of storytelling is done through in-game graffiti, implied events, and smaller details you might miss in one playthrough. The sheer amount of survivor dialogue for each situation ensures that every playthrough will feel slightly different than another.\n\nCombat in L4D2 is very rewarding and intense. You can carry a primary weapon, a sidearm/melee weapon, a throwable, and two medical items. Your typical FPS guns are here, but they're punchy and feel powerful. The dismemberment system for enemies really drives home how deadly your attacks can be. Rifle rounds can blast limbs off of the Infected, shotgun blasts tear them to pieces, and explosives reduce them to piles of body parts. Common Infected enemies will swarm you and slow you down with their hits, but the real threats come from the Special Infected. Each one has a musical cue to signal its arrival and can hamper your team with their abilities. Spitters launch acidic bile that blankets the ground and damages you, Hunters can leap long distances and pounce on you, and Tanks turn ordinary gunfights into chaotic boss battles with their huge health total and powerful attacks.\n\nRNG elements are present in how campaigns operate, primarily driven by the game's AI Director. This affects the placement of Infected, locations of items, and sometimes even the level design itself! You might get lucky and find some laser sights to enhance your gun's accuracy in one run, while in another you might find a bottle of pills in the same spot. A shortcut to the bumper cars might be open in Dark Carnival, or you might have to take a slightly longer way around. The Witch, a docile infected that instantly downs you when provoked enough, could be in any number of places - some of which might directly get in your way. Small and large scale changes like these keep you from getting too used to the way a certain campaign plays.\n\nL4D2 also has a wide variety of modes to offer. Aside from the campaigns (single player or co-op), there are competitive modes like Versus (where one side plays as the Special Infected and the others as the Survivors) and Scavenge (where Survivors fill up a generator while the Special Infected try to stop them). There is also a Survival mode where you hold out as long as possible against an unending horde...as well as Versus Survival, where 4 Special Infected players can mess with 4 Survivor players trying to stand their ground. On top of that, there are Mutations that introduce unique game mechanics to campaigns, a Realism mode that nerfs the Survivors and encourages greater communication to survive, and Developer Commentary sections for some of the maps.\n\nIt's a game jam-packed full of content that feels fully realized and fleshed-out, and that isn't even starting on the mod support! L4D2 allows you to play custom campaigns and Survival levels made by the community, such as the surreal [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257961887]Time to Die[/url] and the action-packed [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128428201]Suicide Blitz 2.[/url] The game goes one step beyond and allows you to alter so much of its content, from the appearances of characters to various sounds to gameplay-altering scripts. Part of the replayability comes from being able to rework the visuals and audio so heavily. You could have TF2 characters wielding CS:GO weapons and fighting zombies from Call of Duty: World at War, and that's just one example of how bizarre the modded game can become.\n\nNo game is perfect, though, and L4D2 does have some minor flaws that deserve to be addressed:\n-The bots aren't always the best at helping you, even with improvement mods active.\n-The survivors from the first games don't have a ton of new lines for the sequel's content, resulting in them saying generic things when pointing out ammo upgrades or melee weapons.\n-The difficulty gap between Advanced and Expert is huge, with Common Infected going from dealing 5 damage per hit to 20 damage per hit.\n-Some melee weapons just feel worse than others, like the Pitchfork's narrow attack range or the Knife's strange swinging arc.\n-The bolt-action sniper rifles are lumped together with the Tier 2 weapons when they would fit better in the less-effective Tier 1 selection.\n-The standard Versus Mode is strongly biased in favor of the Survivors, which means that they'll usually escape a map unless the players are incompetent or the Special Infected can simultaneously incapacitate all of them.\n-A couple of campaigns overdo it with the \"unending horde\" event leading up to a map's end, Cold Stream standing out with almost [i]every[/i] level having that scenario.\n\nThe survivor interactions, the enemy variety in campaigns, the thrilling combat, the musical direction - it all comes together to create this masterpiece of a co-op shooter. I can't recommend it enough, especially since its price is reasonable and it often goes on sale. The more you learn about L4D2's mechanics, the more you appreciate the hard work and detail put into the game. Although I would recommend starting the game without any mods to get used to it, I would strongly suggest using the improvement mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238957546]Correct Campaign Order,[/url] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121094109]CrazyRabbit's Tactical Flashlight,[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2165823958]Remove Explosion Flash.[/url] These small mods will go a long way to making Left 4 Dead 2 accessible, easy to pick up, and free of some in-game annoyances. With or without mods, though, L4D2 ranks high for me as Valve's best game.

However due to my computer at the time being built in the year 2009 it could not handle it and after it restarted which took 2 hours, when it turned on it was very slow. Upon turning off the computer I got stuck in Windows Repair loop, and nothing worked. It always gave me an error message and would just send me back to the start of the loop. In frustration, I hit the side of my computer with a hammer, the computer made a *beep* sound which turned off the computer permanently. Since my car was broken I could not go to the store and buy one and had to wait until a friend of mine was free to go browse for computers which took about 1 1/2 weeks. During that time, I had entered pure isolation. I had not done anything meaningful to society as I was thinking about all of the Keith Stories i was missing out, all of the funny \"Your mum's car\" lines I was not hearing, and all the cheeseburgers coach would eat as he appears to be a very hungry individual. I had entered a deranged state at day 10, which I had devoted myself during that time to Prayer and Contemplation about life. At this point I did not need the computer, or any sort of technology, but rather I needed time away, I was free. The shackles of the internet were no longer leeched on to me, I had reached transcendence, possessing knowledge far beyond a layman's comprehension, I even wrote a little bit on how to solve problems that plague the world..

And I have to say, some of my teammates take that encouragement to heart. But one guy in particular really stood out. Let's call him \"Toxic Tom.\"\n\nToxic Tom was a real piece of work. He spent more time insulting our team and team killing than actually playing the game. And his favorite target? Yours truly. I mean, I get it - I'm a pretty easy target. But come on, man!\n\nAt one point, we were in the middle of a big zombie horde, trying to fight our way through to safety. I turn around to check on Tom, and what do I see? Him pointing his shotgun right at my face! I had no time to react before he pulled the trigger and sent me flying.\n\nBut here's the thing: I survived. And Tom didn't. That's right, folks - the toxic team killer got what was coming to him. Karma's a b*tch, Tom. Maybe next time you'll think twice before shooting your own teammates in the back.\n\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game, but beware of Toxic Tom and his ilk. Play with friends if you can, or at least keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.

Ultimately this is a game of situational awareness, teamwork and gunplay in which four players face the AI director which determines the frequency of attacks, supplies and blocked off routes in one of the many campaign maps. This allows better players to be faced with more challenging experiences and likewise, newer players with more forgiving affairs. These variations in player experiences mean the game doesn't get stale compared to scripted events which are common in many other games, which greatly helps replayability.\n\nOn that topic, the game is workshop ready. Essentially any aesthetic changes you wish to make, you can. Feel like changing the four survivors to Dark Souls NPCs? Absolutely. My Little Ponies? Sure. My experience is modded for as much realism as the game can squeeze out, and of course all of it is free, which by todays standards is unheard of. \n\nThe mechanics of the game are responsive and fluid, tried and tested on the source engine, which also means almost all PCs will run this well. The graphics are somewhat outdated, but not so much as to effect the player experience negatively in any way. And of course, the workshop can improve this aspect if you wish.\n\nThe 8 survivors available are for the most part, loveable, relatable and hilarious, and with a slew of interactions between them on top, you really end up liking most of the cast. Music is fairly well done in this game, while not being at the forefront of the player experience, there's clear thought put into its implementation. Certain musical cues will occur to alert the player that certain special enemies are close by.\n\nEssentially the gameplay loop will consist of making your way from point A to point B across a campaign, consisting of a number of maps, concluding in a finale mission with a timed holdout situation (or other twists). Regular horde zombies stand in your way, acting as fodder to slow you down and overwhelm you while a selection of special enemies spawn periodically. These will typically incapacitate one of your team members, so looking out for one another is paramount. These synergies of special enemies become even more important in the Versus game mode, in which teams of four take turns playing as the infected. While considered a toxic element of the game, this mode is very fun. Perhaps I am biased as I've played this game for a very long time, so newer players may feel intimidated by this mode. There are a lot of newbie servers available however which I recommend.\n\nAll in all, I would consider this game to be a must own for any fan of zombies or team shooters. For the price, especially during sales, it's an absolute steal.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\nThe quintessential horde shooter.\nSmooth and responsive gameplay with excellent mechanics for survivors and infected.\nExtensive workshop items to help customise your game experience.\nAI director improves replayability.\nExcellent value for money.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nVersus can be problematic for newer players - recommended to find servers suitable for newbies.", "timestamp_created": 1689677803, "timestamp_updated": 1689677803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0,

Exactly playing with your frinds. This game made my childhood wonderful. 1500 hours i played at xbox 360, 600 hours I played in pirat version. So fun to play add-on campains, also a lot of different official campains. My favourites: (No Mercy, Dead Air, Dead Center, The sacrifise.) \n Really charismatic survivours, they are really emotional like real people, but I'f you don't like official survivours, you can search in workshop. \n First time when I saw l4d2, when I was 5 or 6 years old my uncle played left 4 dead 1 with his friends. I really was interest about thus game, but he don't let me play. Then  after 10 days, or something, I saw left 4 dead 2 demo version of left 4 dead 2. I was really happy as a crazy. It was only 2 chapters of the  parish. I think play enough 500 hrs in demo version of left 4 dead 2. It was really fun, I also played with my sister. \n When I was 11 years old, my dad bought this game in Xbox 360. But something was missing. It was versus, because I saw some youtubers played versus, and it was really intresting to play as a zombie. \n When I was 12 years old, I downloaded pirat version of left 4 dead 2 to play versus, or online. The reason why I played pirat, depends with I was 12 years old, that I don't had any bank card. \n Thanks valve for really Memoreable game, It returns me every year to play with friends, or just

first.\nGame is solid, campaigns are varied and has plenty of surprises to keep the game engaging, a real upgrade from L4D1, and is probably one of  the best Team Games that I highly recommend with friends. The game has value and can be worth the price.\n\nBut here's where the negatives come into play.\nThe biggest problem this game has is it's community, it is absolutely toxic 100% and if you don't have the stomach for it don't bother. You will get torn apart and most games turn into massive arguments over the simplest things, you will get kicked for the stupidest reasons before you can even finish a level, no one is wholesome or welcoming, everyone makes every attempt to post offensive and nasty comments ranging from simple bullying to outright racism and political, equipped with the most graphic of porn sprays, no one is ever happy even when winning a game, and if you aren't amazing at this game you will get branded the whole game regardless of the situation. Not to mention hackers and con artists who also break the game in two.\n\nOn the plus side, it also becomes a good grieving engine if you are into that, personally I have no qualms with grieving back when they start to get real nasty, but then again that could also lead to the side effect of adding to the problem so if you plan to do so, just be aware it can backfire badly for as much as it can be rewarding when done right.\n\nBasically, the game is only good with friends, and I do mean ONLY good with friends, so unless you have the stomach for it, or you accept the way the community is, or if you are outright sadistic, I don't recommend online.\n\nOverall, the game can be good, but the zombies are doing us a favour by eating up the horrible toxic community that play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1671543422, "timestamp_updated": 1671543422, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536004781723022461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125621433": {"recommendationid": "125621433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045857420", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 274, "playtime_forever": 7603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7603, "last_played": 1653330794}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]If you dont own the game, what are you waiting for?[/h1]\nThe OG Zombie Wave Shooter\n\nContains new and old Levels, great gameplay and infinite content with the Workshop.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Left 4 Dead 2 had been your go-to escape from the challenges of the real world. Tonight, however, would be different.\n\nYou fired up the game and joined a random online lobby, ready to face the infected hordes with your newfound team. The chatter of your teammates filled your headphones, a cacophony of voices from around the world united by a single purpose: survival.\n\nYou picked your favorite character, Ellis, and set off on a zombie-killing spree with your teammates. The adrenaline surged through your veins as you mowed down wave after wave of infected. But amidst the chaos and destruction, something felt off.\n\nAs the game progressed, you noticed that one of your teammates, a player named \"LoneWolf92,\" seemed to be struggling. Their character lagged behind, missing shots and stumbling over obstacles. You tried to help, offering first aid kits and cover, but it seemed like something was wrong on their end.\n\nLoneWolf92's voice came through your headset, shaky and filled with frustration. \"Sorry, folks,\" they muttered, \"I'm not doing so well tonight. Just go on without me.\"\n\nDespite the urgency of the situation, you couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for LoneWolf92. Their struggles mirrored those in your own life\u2014a feeling of being overwhelmed and left behind.\n\nYou and your remaining teammates forged ahead, pushing through the relentless onslaught of infected. The safe room was in sight, and victory seemed within reach. But as you turned back to see if LoneWolf92 had caught up, you realized they had disconnected from the game.\n\n\"Sorry, guys,\" you heard through your headphones as their voice trembled one last time. \"I can't do this anymore. Goodbye.\"\n\nThe message was clear: LoneWolf92 had given up, not just on the game but perhaps on something deeper. You couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness as you continued to play, the thrill of victory tainted by the memory of a teammate who had, in that moment, lost their own battle.\n\nAs you logged off for the night and shut down your computer, you couldn't shake the melancholy feeling that had settled over you. Left 4 Dead 2 had always been an escape, but tonight, it had reminded you of the struggles and loneliness that could lurk just beneath the surface, even in the virtual world.", "timestamp_created":

and published by Valve. The game was released in 2009 and became a real hit in the zombie apocalypse genre.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Left 4 Dead 2\" is based on team play, where you will fight together with three other players to survive in a dangerous world overrun by zombies. The game offers a variety of settings, such as city streets, abandoned cities, swamps and other locations full of dangers and bloodthirsty zombies.\n\nOne of the main advantages of \"Left 4 Dead 2\" is its intensity and dynamism. Zombies are coming at you from all sides, and you must make quick decisions, fight the hordes of enemies and stay safe. The game features different types of zombies, each with their own characteristics and threat to your team. Additionally, Left 4 Dead 2 offers a wide variety of weapons including rifles, shotguns, katanas and more to help you deal with the zombie invasion.\n\nOne of the main advantages of the game is the cooperative mode, which allows you to play with friends or other players online. Taking on friends together adds new layers of interaction and tactical decisions as you must cooperate to survive.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 also features a Versus mode, where you can play as one of the special infected characters against a team of survivors. This adds new entertainment and a dose of competition to the gameplay.\n\nThe graphics in the game, although not the most modern, are still quite high quality and atmospheric. Realistic environmental details and sound effects create a tense and scary atmosphere, making \"Left 4 Dead 2\" a real horror game on the playing field.\n\nEven though the game has been out for a long time, Left 4 Dead 2 is still popular and actively supported, with many mods and add-ons that enhance the gaming experience and add new features.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead 2 is an exciting and tense shooter that offers a great co-op experience with friends.

with a group of friends by your side. Left 4 Dead 2 elevates the cooperative gaming experience to a whole new level. The strategic gameplay, the intense moments, and the shared victories cement the bonds between players, fostering camaraderie like no other game can.\n\nTimeless Gameplay: Despite being released years ago, Left 4 Dead 2's gameplay remains as fresh and exciting as ever. The innovative AI Director ensures that each playthrough feels like a unique challenge, never letting you rest on your laurels. The adrenaline rush from fighting off hordes of infected, escaping crescendo events, and rescuing downed teammates keeps me coming back for more, time and time again.\n\nImmersive World: Valve's attention to detail in creating a post-apocalyptic Southern setting is awe-inspiring. From the eerie, mist-covered swamps to the desolate, crumbling cityscapes, each environment is crafted with love and care, immersing players in a world overrun by chaos. The atmosphere alone is enough to send shivers down your spine.\n\nDynamic Characters: The diverse cast of survivors are not just cookie-cutter heroes; they are full-fledged personalities with unique backstories and distinct interactions. Whether you're taking the lead as the tough-as-nails Rochelle or playing the wise-cracking Ellis, each survivor brings their flavor to the game, making the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n\nRoachelle", "timestamp_created": 1691030719, "timestamp_updated": 1691030719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988",

Even though it was delivered with an astonishing (read: somewhat concerning) turn around time, it ultimately doesn't feel as rushed as the first, offering\u2014with the exception of a still-missing capable single-player component\u2014a solid multiplayer suite that doesn't skimp on modes, maps or options. Versus, Survival, Scavenge and the new Realism mode, which I haven't delved into as much as the other game types, all feature plenty of variety in terms of levels and mode-specific maps.\n\nBut if you didn't care for the original Left 4 Dead's brand of multiplayer mayhem, Left 4 Dead 2 won't do much to change your mind. Me? I did care for the original Left 4 Dead, deeply, playing more of that game than any other this year.

"review": "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "timestamp_created": 1679815356, "timestamp_updated": 1679823417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135454324": {"recommendationid": "135454324", "author": {"steamid": "76561199472470250", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1695527813}, "language": "english", "review": "jockey sex mode activated", "timestamp_created": 1679813395, "timestamp_updated": 1679813395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135451750": {"recommendationid": "135451750", "author": {"steamid": "76561199488227316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1683333010}, "language": "english", "review": "its goooooood", "timestamp_created": 1679809991, "timestamp_updated": 1679809991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135450452": {"recommendationid": "135450452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242538360", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1687566284}, "language": "english", "review": "vidya", "timestamp_created": 1679808219, "timestamp_updated": 1679808219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135440827": {"recommendationid": "135440827", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097400847", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "playtime_at_review": 2739, "last_played": 1696382254}, "language": "english", "review": "6/7 friends like this game. the 7th friend is tied up to a tree getting stones thrown at him.", "timestamp_created": 1679796644, "timestamp_updated": 1679796644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135438716": {"recommendationid": "135438716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199686622", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1694907454}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 50 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.I am a single father for my son who is now 14 years old.

The team have managed to infuse their sequel with the exact same kind of nuanced creative energies that usually takes them years, and in doing so they've made last year's accomplished Left 4 Dead look like a simple mod in comparison.", "timestamp_created": 1677420220, "timestamp_updated": 1677420220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133658784": {"recommendationid": "133658784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325502466", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "playtime_at_review": 8776, "last_played": 1696275600}, "language": "english", "review": "best zombie game there is this game was my childhood", "timestamp_created": 1677411892, "timestamp_updated": 1677411892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133623116": {"recommendationid": "133623116", "author": {"steamid": "76561199201693124", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "playtime_at_review": 1987, "last_played": 1696111967}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1677369644, "timestamp_updated": 1677369644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133614215": {"recommendationid": "133614215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079709799", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 29202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29021, "last_played": 1686657481}, "language": "english", "review": "Well number of hours played says it all xD", "timestamp_created": 1677360956, "timestamp_updated": 1677360956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133599790": {"recommendationid": "133599790", "author": {"steamid": "76561199436037603", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 800, "last_played": 1687283358}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD GAME AND A CLASSIC", "timestamp_created": 1677348462, "timestamp_updated": 1677348462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133583219": {"recommendationid": "133583219", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064191701", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1690465988}, "language": "english", "review": "L4D2.. The sequel to L4D1, I feel like this is one of the best sequels to a game. The new stuff it added, holy. So many new weapons, and now you have melee weapons too! Melee weapons are very well done in this game, especially the chainsaw, the gore it produces is pretty good to say the least. The graphics look much better, and I think there is a bigger variety of the common infected, now the characters. The characters are just very loveable. Coach is the fatass badass and a funny guy, Nick is well grumpy and a serious guy, Rochelle is just like Zoey, a badass girl and the final guy.. Ellis. Ellis is a very funny guy, and he is pretty badass aswell, Ellis might be my favorite of them all. The special infected are pretty good too, I won't say the ones that existed in L4D1 but the ones that were added. Welll the first one would be the Spitter, Spitter is basically what it says. A zombie that spits some goo shit at you and the goo shit decreases your health and I would rate it a 8/10. The next one is Jockey.. Jockey is just a annoying little shit, he jumps at you and then like claws you while also controlling your movement. He is pretty annoying but a good addition to the Hunter, 6/10. The last one, Charger.. I have some bad memories with this dude, so the Charger is a zombie that charges at you and when he catches you. He slams you to the ground as many times as he can until he gets killed, also when he charges at you you basically get sent flying to another dimension. Okay so now the chapters, the chapters in this game are just as fun as the ones in L4D1, if not even better. You have the L4D ones, and the new ones aswell. Well that was all, the game is a 10/10 as it's just amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1677335299, "timestamp_updated": 1677335299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133567609": {"recommendationid": "133567609", "author": {"steamid": "76561199343767109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 950, "last_played": 1692177861}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it mucq:*", "timestamp_created": 1677320359, "timestamp_updated": 1677320359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133547099": {"recommendationid": "133547099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318847306", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 13352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10518, "last_played": 1695006085}, "language": "english", "review": "Versus is pretty hard but people calling me retarded and kicking me helps me improve.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "timestamp_created": 1674510327, "timestamp_updated": 1674510327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131418426": {"recommendationid": "131418426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081061296", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 16812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16812, "last_played": 1672628679}, "language": "english", "review": "Sooo my pee is motherhecking purple now.\nCOVID\nYep.

I also made mod where all common infected are small sloveian femboys that try to be dominant to women ( woman are more dominant than them) i also put mod where charger has very big titty and big jiggly booty, to match his very big right arm which grew doing the naughty naughty. I also made a mod where Jockey jumps on your face and twerks like Niki Manaj but with his smol chikz, and i made the spitter riley reid and she spits white substance ( which may or not be the one that i saw on the hub) and lastly i made mod where i turn witch into male ( she/he now has big penis arms). \nIf you are intrested in my content visit my internet page :)\nhttps://raidshadowlegends.com/\ni put very much time in this game and tried very hard to make family friendly mods :)!\ni thank you for reading this, this was my life's work, it is probbably going to be more popular than my chidren!

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on youtube.

This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.

The sheer thrill of it is immense and fun.\n\n  This game obviously has a Workshop so modding this game is fun and funny at some points. Thanks to it, this is why the community is still up. Aside from that, the game offers more weapons, three new Special Infected, a third \"grenade\", a second temporarily health booster, and of course, more campaigns. This game is a bit more difficult than its prequel, just to add. In the newer Campaigns (and Survivors as well), it is more comedic and lighthearted, which also includes a Southern style to it.\n\n  So, of course, I highly recommend getting this game as it offers a lot more content in general than its previous game, but, I recommend getting that one too since it's the game that started all to shape into this one.", "timestamp_created": 1673020575,

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.\nEventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "timestamp_created": 1672364378, "timestamp_updated": 1672364378, "voted_up":

You can mod everything and what is cool is that everyone see only his mods, you don't need to send them or anything, the game can be really funny with all these goofy mods like Homer Simpson as common zombies or a golden pan from Tf2. \nPlus, the campaign is good, the gamemodes are all fun, you can play this game on hardcore difficulty or just destroy some zombies easily ! The characters are just perfect and you can use the workshop to mod them in every charcter you want, well almost...\n\nThe game isn't to hard to learn but you'll need to know every type of infected, all weapons and throwables, cooperation \nand communication and be a good mate for yours ! It's the best way to survive : collaboration.\n\nThe game is really cheap and its even more cheap for all the fun your going to have.\n\nGo and kill some zombies with your friends or other survivors like me !

I've played it for a bit and have owned it for over a year I can give some solid insight to a game I really, really enjoy.\n\nThis game certainly has some issues here and there and you get those \"what the hell happened\" moments but its really fun especially on medium difficulties playing with friends. This game shines the most when you have 3-4 people playing with you. This game isn't nearly as fun but is far easier when playing solo but its still a really enjoyable experience, however the ally AI are very very stupid at times which is to be expected of a 13 almost 14 year old game. This game has brought me and my friends closer through finding fun addons that change models or custom campaigns. As long as there is people making custom content this game is effectively endless. For $10 and if you catch it on sale for less its worth it. \n\nSometimes on higher difficulty it gets really overwhelming but its never really unfair. The only thing I've disliked about this game thinking to when i first bought it is the common zombie AI. When you turn they follow you on your back and its near impossible to get them off of you. But honestly if you have someone covering you its not an issue. Sometimes hits don't register and I personally don't like versus as much but I see the appeal and play it very occasionally. \n\nThe only other gripe I have about this game is the Non-official dedicated servers. Lots of these have buggy systems or straight up lock you to Expert-Realism and or Lock you to a HIGHER difficulty than Expert which is just really annoying when I just wanna hang out and have fun. then you have to play round robin to try and find a server (and not get the same server) to play on. We have even had to have one of us occupy the bad server, have another person Que up another custom map so the bad server is occupied, you're screwed if you have two crappy servers your client only wants you to connect to.", "timestamp_created": 1670623920, "timestamp_updated": 1670623920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128243839": {"recommendationid": "128243839", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174954208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 546, "last_played": 1694973230}, "language": "english", "review": "+Supr hra, grafiky z\u00e1m\u011brn\u011b nejsou dokonal\u00e9 a proto je to tak supr v multiplayeru\n+tam nem\u00e1te TRUBKU\n+nejsou tam tak \u010daste lagy", "timestamp_created": 1670615004, "timestamp_updated": 1670615004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128199780": {"recommendationid": "128199780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241473106", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2482, "last_played": 1690956171}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you enjoy running from a horde of Dr. Zoidberg's while reloading a pea shooter with Joker and Booker DeWitt at your side unloading an ungodly amount of lead into the crowd?

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki \"Yagoo\" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1670091902, "timestamp_updated": 1670091902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1,

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1669184773, "timestamp_updated": 1669186370,

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead\u2013 murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time \u2013 something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange \u2013 uh, I guess... I guess you call it a \"hit\" \u2013 on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in \"Blood Money.\"] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.

Versus is still fun, but I recommend going in with a few friends to make the best out of it. However, for me personally, it's the campaigns and mutations that shine the brightest. Mutations can be downloaded from the workshop or you can play Valve's assortment, either way, it offers a goofy and chaotic experience that can vastly change your gameplay experience from the traditional modes. \n Vanilla campaigns are still a blast to play, and when you buy the game on PC, you get all DLC included for free (L4D1 campaigns, Cold Stream, Last Stand and The Sacrifice) so you'll have quite a bit of content when you first launch the game. \n  Arguably, the best part of this game is the workshop support, for that is where the community is most active. There you can discover amazing new campaigns, hilarious or horrific models for survivors and infected alike, weapon replacements, sound effects and anything else you could ever want. \n\n Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a solid, gripping and amazingly fun experience even this far after launch. If you had all the fun you could have in the Vanilla experience, go to the workshop and make a whole new one. \n This game is fun Solo but Co-op is where it shines best, especially if you have a solid group of pals you can play with. \n I strongly recommend picking this up, and since it constantly goes on sell, there's no better deal when you're looking for a fun new game to play.", "timestamp_created": 1666639343, "timestamp_updated": 1666639343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124327101": {"recommendationid": "124327101", "author": {"steamid": "76561199401113825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1689983858}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1666623866, "timestamp_updated": 1666623866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124325891": {"recommendationid": "124325891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404944699", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1690844262}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing alot of l4d2 lately, the more than TF2, and i love to play this with friends.

The answer is simple: It's time to party like it's the end of the world!\n\nIn L4D2, you'll team up with three other survivors to fight your way through hordes of zombies and other infected creatures. But don't worry, you're not alone - you'll have a variety of weapons at your disposal, from shotguns to frying pans. And if things get really tough, you can always use your teammates as bait.\n\nThe game's various campaigns take you through a variety of locales, from the streets of New Orleans to an abandoned amusement park. But no matter where you are, you can always count on encountering a swarm of zombies waiting to give you a warm (or cold) welcome.\n\nThe real star of the show, however, is the game's infamous AI Director. This sadistic genius will throw everything it's got at you, from tanks to witches to that one zombie that just won't die. But don't worry, it's all in good fun - or at least that's what the Director tells itself.\n\nIn short, Left 4 Dead 2 is the perfect game for anyone who wants to experience the thrill of surviving a zombie apocalypse without having to actually risk getting bitten. So grab your friends, stock up on weapons, and get ready to fight for your life. And who knows, you might even make it out alive - or at least undead.", "timestamp_created": 1679584912, "timestamp_updated": 1681619642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife left me.

"review": "How to extract DNA from a kiwi fruit\nTo do this experiment, you will need:\nA kiwi fruit (an onion will do if you don't have a kiwi) 5g washing up liquid or hand soap 2g salt 100ml tap water 100ml of ice cold alcohol (white rum or methylated spirits are best). Put in freezer for at least 30 mins. kettle 3 jars large basin some thing to mash the kiwi with sieve or coffee filter paper knife (be careful!)\n\nHow to do the experiment:\n1 - Peel the kiwi fruit and chop it into small chunks. You don't want the skin because it's mostly dead and doesn't have much DNA in it.\n\n2 - Put the chunks in a jar and mash the kiwi as much as you can. This is to break up some of the cells and provide a large surface area over which to extract the DNA.\n\n3 - Mix together the washing up liquid, the salt and the tap water and stir slowly until the salt has dissolved. Don't stir too fast or else you'll get lots of bubbles! This mixture is also known as an extraction buffer. The washing up liquid is a detergent and this breaks open the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Once these membranes are broken, the DNA stored in the cells can escape. The dissolved salt (or sodium chloride) is made up of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. DNA is also negatively charged and attracts the positively charged sodium ions. This neutralises the charge on the DNA, which allows the strands of DNA to stick together and form the clumps we will see later inthe experiment.\n\n4 - Add the extraction buffer to the mashed up kiwi and MASH! The more you mash, the more DNA you will get out at the end.\n\n5 - Incubate the kiwi and buffer mixture at 60 degrees Centigrade for 15 minutes. To make your own incubator, take a large basin and half fill it with boiling water from a kettle. To reduce the temperature, add about the same amount again of normal tap water. Using a thermometer will help you reach a more precise temperature. Carefully put the jar with the kiwi into the incubator and leave to stand for 15 minutes. Incubation helps to break up the cells further and starts to degrade some of the cell's proteins.\n\n6 - Remove the jar from the incubator and filter the kiwi mixture through a fine sieve or coffee filter paper into another jar. This removes all the unwanted lumps and bits of kiwi fruit. You should be left with a green liquid, and this contains the kiwi fruit DNA.\n\n7 - Take the ice cold alcohol and pour it slowly down the side of the jar. The alcohol will form a transparent layer on top of the kiwi mixture, as the alcohol is less dense.\n\nWhat do you see?\nWhere the layer of ice cold alcohol meets the kiwi mixture underneath, you will see a white jelly-like substance forming. This is the kiwi DNA. Dna Is Soluble in Water But Not in Alcohol, So When it Touches The Alcohol it Comes Out of Solution And Forms a Solid. This Is Known As 'precipitating The Dna'. The Longer You Leave The Alcohol With The Kiwi Mixture\n\nYou can use a paper clip or some tweezers to pick up the DNA. It will be long and stringy and clump together. DNA is a very long molecule and when it clumps together, it forms something a bit like a rope. This is safe to play with a poke at. The DNA you have extracted has come from billions of kiwi fruit cells, which is why you can see it so easily. If you were able to unravel the DNA in just one human cell and stretch it out, it would be two metres long. However as DNA is so thin, you would not be able to see it without an incredibly powerful microscope.\n\n \n\nIngredients\nKiwi FruitA kiwi fruit (an onion will do if you don't have a kiwi) 5g washing up liquid or hand soap2g salt100ml tap water100ml of ice cold alcohol (white rum or methylated spirits are best).

place.\n\nIngredients:\n\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n\n1/2 cup white sugar\n\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n\n1/4 cup water\n\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced\n\n1 pastry for double-crust pie\n\nDirections:\n\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n\nCombine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n\nRoll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n\nRoll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern.

I've had many hours of fun on xbox 360 and about 3 - 4 years ago that I managed to buy the game in digital I can say for sure this game is a must pick if you want to play a fun co-op game with friends or alone and just shoot zombies and have fun in voice chat or if ya'll think they are up for the challenge to play expert then do. The replayability of the l4d2 is one that many games want (valve games in general) and a lot of them fail to succeed but this does perfectly if you are playing vanilla the campaings are made such that you will never get the exact perfect run as you did last time it will always be dynamic and even if you get bored of the vanilla campaings and the new last stand campaing you can try versus and master the special infected and use their skills to become a foe worthy for the enemy team and even if you don't like versus you can try surviving for as long you can in survival mode. The mods are their own can of worms in the good way of course the fact that you can have a black suit for nick or make rochelle isabelle from animal crossing fighting a horde of elmos while a kermit charges doom guy its hilarious and lets not forget the custom maps make the game difficult or make it a fresch coat of paint from the standard maps.\n\nI'll be seen as a dickrider if I didn't mention the negative aspect of the game which for me atleast were minimal it is still a bother for me atleast starting up with the bots I do not know why valve despite making amazing games with details that make the world seem more dynamic has the worst AI out of all the games I've played during my lifespan like there bots will do stupid actions like heal mid horde, try to revive a party member while the tank is 0.1 yards away from it, and a bunch of other junk that might kill your run (specially in harder difficulties). The expert difficulties seem like if they werent made in some areas of the map mostly on crescendo events where you have to slow down your progress in some maps and have to deal with a horde of zombies that come from both sides meaning that unless you have cover which beats the porpuse of running through a bunch of zombies to get to a saferoom or some other area to run foward but that be due to me not being good at gaming but still a kinda of bother. If you are going to play with friends and theres an empty slot that is replaced with a bot the run will be 10x harder due to the incompetence of the bot because of the problems I've mentioned above.\n\nMy final answer will be a yes, do buy it the game despite everything relating to old source engine and other things it still has to be one of the greatest casual zombie games and beats most of the genre completly due to how fun the game is.", "timestamp_created": 1665019984, "timestamp_updated": 1665019984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518201291561126709", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140389049": {"recommendationid": "140389049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023045154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1687021923}, "language": "english", "review": "This is Felix.

The game is still worth checking out despite its age, and the community is still very strong. These games go on deep discount often if you are curious about them, and if you are only going to play one of them, L4D2 includes the L4D1 campaigns in the game, so you\u2019d be better off just getting L4D2.\n\nYou play as part of a team of 4 (Human or CPU teammates) fighting your way from safe house to safe house while encountering hordes of the infected (zombies). You will face 10 different types of enemies who will each attack you differently, as well as the common infected (basic zombies) attacking in a giant mob at times. So you will have to be prepared on how to handle each enemy type very quickly, since this is a very fast paced game.\n\nThe multiplayer comes with a lot of different modes, like campaign, versus, survival ect. In my short time with the game I\u2019ve found some pretty fun and nice players, as well as some cry babies and jack wagons, as to be expected in any online multiplayer experience.\n\nIf you are playing with a controller and want to customize your controls, you will need to follow the steps listed in the QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS below, since LFD2 doesn\u2019t save your controller settings for some reason, at least not as of April 2023. \n\nI found that equipping the \u201cXBOX HUD Without The \u201cY\u201d Icon Mod,\u201d and making the Back/View used to enable voice chat to be a good start. With using \u201cTAB\u201d to start text chat, \u201cy\u201d to vote yes, and \u201cn\u201d to vote no, for the keyboard features. Adjust accordingly to your personal preferences.  \n\nIt\u2019s a cool game, I already knew and loved Bill from Dead By Daylight, and I like Zoey because she looks very similar to Meg from Dead By Daylight.

So, why do I recommend this game? It\u2018s because it is a good game to play alone and with friends. It has alot of story telling that you can notice if you listen to the survivors. The game also supports workshop mods, and theres alot to install to choose from. But that aside, just playing it is super enjoyable. But just because I recommend it. Does it not mean it has no bugs. There are bugs like sometimes that the bot survivors don\u2018t want to help you just because of an little path finding issue. But away from the bugs, now to the community. If you wanna play versus, I recommend playing it rather with friends alone. You will instantly be kicked by one mistake/not knowing the map or having only 100 hours. The players can be toxic like that. But, if you wanna play versus, little tipp from me. Play every map like 5 times so you know where to go, then when you know where to go, try like a single player versus mod. Once you tried doing single player versus mod and feel like you\u2018re ready. Play public versus, but make sure your steam profile is on friends only/private or atleast friends only game activity. So that you wont be instantly kicked just because you have no where close to 1000 hours. Back to campaign, if you wanna play modded servers I recommend doing local server hosting to get the best experience (for multiplayer). If your friends can\u2018t join of some error. Try best dedicated hosting.

"language": "english", "review": "The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\nStrategy\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider\u2019s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1673745017, "timestamp_updated": 1673745017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516891896724700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127241140": {"recommendationid": "127241140", "author": {"steamid": "76561199435079143", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 105387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4752, "playtime_at_review": 3255, "last_played": 1696382455}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game", "timestamp_created": 1669563318, "timestamp_updated": 1669563318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516778528690338135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139911319": {"recommendationid": "139911319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306310353", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1696083256}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that is from 2009 and it still manage to get more people playing than in Back 4 Blood", "timestamp_created": 1686515928, "timestamp_updated": 1686516168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516648709774017334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131993292": {"recommendationid": "131993292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306381923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 28600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5507, "last_played": 1687877171}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, this is probably the only game you should be playing.

For me personally the good aspects have been overpowering but I think that is only the case because I mainly played with friends, I am pretty sure that the game is a lot less fun solo.\n\nThe campains are great and you can spend a lot of time on them, especially when playing with friends. The bots are sadly pretty much useless and that is more and more a problem on higher difficulties. I installed a mod to help with that a tiny bit but am still not able to play solo with bots on higher than normal difficulty.\nThe gameplay is nice, you have normal hordes of zombies as well as special mutated with their own unique abilities. They spawn more or less randomly and add a bit more spice to the normal enemies.\n\nThere are multiple gamemodes, one is a surviver vs zombies one, where you play in a group against others in multiplayer. I've only played it with friends but i've heard that this is the mode that is most populated still. This mode is not too much fun in my personal opinion but if you enjoy dead by daylight and similar games i am sure you'd have fun with this as well.\n\nSo, in conclusion: this game is great in multiplayer, less so alone.

apocalypse to a whole new level!\n\nLet's start with what makes this game so darn special. The first thing that comes to mind is the AI Director \u2013 a genius system that ensures every playthrough is different and unpredictable. You never know what's going to happen next, which keeps things fresh and exciting.\n\nAnd speaking of excitement, the gameplay is just nuts. You're thrown into the middle of a zombie apocalypse with just a few fellow survivors, and you have to fight your way through hordes of the undead to safety. The combat is intense and satisfying, and the variety of weapons and gadgets at your disposal is just plain awesome.\n\nBut what really sets Left 4 Dead 2 apart is the teamwork aspect. This is a game that's meant to be played with friends, and it's all about working together to survive. You'll need to watch each other's backs, share resources, and coordinate your attacks if you want to make it out alive.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the zombies themselves. Left 4 Dead 2 is chock-full of unique and terrifying enemy types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The Smokers will grab you from a distance, the Hunters will pounce on you from above, and the Tanks...well, let's just say you do NOT want to mess with the Tanks.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a game that's not afraid to take risks and do things differently. From the AI Director to the teamwork to the terrifying enemies, this game is an absolute blast to play. If you're a fan of zombie games or just looking for something unique and exciting, then you need to give this game a try. Just don't forget to bring some friends along for the ride!", "timestamp_created": 1683216394, "timestamp_updated": 1683216394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Whether it's Coach's motivating speeches, Ellis's humorous anecdotes, Rochelle's calm demeanor, or Nick's sarcastic wit, you'll find yourself forming a bond with your virtual team.\n\nSpeaking of teamwork, Left 4 Dead 2 places a strong emphasis on cooperation, which is where the game truly shines. Working together with friends or other online players is an exhilarating experience, as you strategize, communicate, and watch each other's backs in the face of relentless hordes of infected. It fosters a sense of camaraderie that few other games can achieve, making it a perfect choice for cooperative gaming enthusiasts.\n\nMoreover, the game's weapon variety and special infected are impressively well-balanced. From shotguns and sniper rifles to melee weapons like baseball bats and chainsaws, each tool of destruction feels satisfying to wield. The special infected, like the Hunter, Smoker, and Boomer, add a layer of unpredictability to the gameplay, keeping you on your toes at all times.\n\nGraphically, Left 4 Dead 2 holds up exceptionally well. The environments are richly detailed, and the character animations are fluid and believable, which further enhances the immersive experience. Additionally, the sound design is top-notch, with the spine-chilling growls and moans of the infected heightening the tension as you navigate through the dark and dangerous world.\n\nFinally, the game's longevity is extraordinary. Even after completing all the campaigns, the community-created content and custom campaigns available through the Steam Workshop ensure that the excitement never dies down. Valve's continuous support for the game over the years is a testament to their commitment to delivering a first-class gaming experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 is an absolute must-play for fans of survival horror and cooperative gaming. Its action-packed gameplay, diverse environments, memorable characters, and excellent replayability make it a timeless classic in the world of video games. Valve has set the bar high for zombie-themed games, and it's safe to say that Left 4 Dead 2 will remain a beloved favorite for years to come.

[b]Missing Material and Models:[/b] A significant drawback is the presence of numerous missing material and models, which have gone unaddressed for a long time, affecting overall immersion and enjoyment.\n\n2. [b]Black Screen Issue on Latest Windows:[/b] Running the game on modern Windows OS can be frustrating due to a persistent black screen problem, even after multiple reinstallations and configuration tweaks, which is disappointing in an era emphasizing compatibility.\n\n3. [b]4 Player Limit:[/b] The game's 4-player limit feels outdated in today's multiplayer gaming landscape, where larger groups are common. Expanding this limit would improve the game's appeal and longevity.\n\nBeing a paid game, developers have a greater responsibility to address these issues as players expect a polished experience. If it were free, some issues might be more forgivable.

There's a lot of new features compared to when it first game out and I couldn't be happier with the results. One of the very few coop zombie games that does it right, thank you Valve. The only issue I'd say there is within the game would be the player base not being so friendly to newcomers, which is quite understandable considering they happen to mess with the flow of the game that all experienced players are used to. There is a massive learning curve within the multiplayer scene of this game and all I'd say is to tread lightly because one mistake can lead to someone calling a votekick on you almost simultaneously.

a co-op shooter where you fight through levels filled with zombies. the combat in left 4 dead 2 is in every way an improvement over the first game, giving you a much larger array of weapons to choose from, with the added addition of melee weapons that provide you much more choice and variety keeping the gameplay fresh and more varied. there is also the addition of the uncommon infected, regular zombies that have unique abilities, such as clown zombies that attract other zombies to it, armoured zombies that have to be attacked from behind, along with a variety of others. this brings more variety to the gameplay with not all zombies acting exactly the same causing you to think about how to take out certain ones or which ones you should focus first, rather than just having every zombie be exactly the same and being able to run through them all without thinking. this game is a massive improvement over the original in basically every way. definitely one of the greatest games of all

War Z and Redfall.  Mods make it even better, as you can practically convert the entire game into Resident Evil if you wanted. Sure the community isn't all that great, but so far I haven't had a bad time in any Community server. From what I've seen so far it does seem the latest update disabled steam workshop mods from being used in Versus which does kinda suck, but I'm sure there would be a way to fix that to where you can at least have skin, sound and custom campaigns mods playable in local versus servers. Still overall a great game and shows just how amazing Valve is with any type of game genre really. I also like how the story was told through game play, things such as listening to what the survivors say, and looking at the level design, Overall a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1689181413, "timestamp_updated": 1689181413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50371551513671875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144666937": {"recommendationid": "144666937", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122719299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9514, "last_played": 1691785495}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn, this is just like that time me and my buddy Keith started up ones of them brand new \"OnlyFans\" interweb sites 'cause we needed the cash.

Trouble was we couldn't find no women, so it had to just be us. I tell you, neither me nor Keith was gay or homosexual or whatever, but people are willing to pay through the nose to see some videos of a guy in a skirt getting his ass turned inside out. Joke's on them, though, seeing as you could probably see that for free if you just looked online or went to the northeast of the country. Anywho, eventually people start askin' Keith to do somethin' called the \"Thug Shaker\", and so he obliged 'cause he wanted money. Bad move. All that shakin' his ass dislodged the pink Hello Kitty buttplug I bought for him, and apparently he needed to shit bad. And I don't mean Taco Bell bad, I mean food poisoning bad. I never did get that stain outta that carpet. Now, this alerted the neighbourhood, and so to quickly destroy our riches and hide our deeds, we went ahead and bought two of every gun on the market. Two days later and Keith was shovin' them up his ass on camera again, though we had to get rid of those too 'cause an M16 don't work so good with shit down the barrel, on account of stimulating Keith's sissy clitty boypussy too much.

yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1673668873, "timestamp_updated": 1673668873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503225803375244141", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129566596": {"recommendationid": "129566596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168134633", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 740, "last_played": 1677415032}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing simulation of working retail during the holidays", "timestamp_created": 1672279802, "timestamp_updated": 1672279802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503050327301025391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130133891": {"recommendationid": "130133891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047919988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1672862541}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just classic.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The series follows the affiliates of David \"Crazy Dave\" Blazing as they use his plants to defend against a zombie invasion, led by Doctor Edgar Zomboss. On April 1, 2009, PopCap released a music video for the song \"Zombies on your Lawn\" to promote Plants vs. Zombies. A PopCap spokesperson, Garth Chouteau, revealed in an IGN interview that Plants vs. Zombies would be released soon on PC and Mac. On April 22, 2009, PopCap released an official game trailer of Plants vs. Zombies on YouTube. During the promotion of Plants vs. Zombies, PopCap released a demo version of the game that could be played for thirty minutes.[5] Plants vs. Zombies was officially released on May 5, 2009, for PC and Mac.\n\nPopCap Games and its assets were bought by EA on July 12, 2011, for 750 million dollars.[7] Fifty employees were laid off in the Seattle studio of PopCap Games on August 21, 2012, to mark a switch of focus to mobile and social gaming.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, PopCap announced that they were working on a sequel to Plants vs. Zombies. Its release date would be set at late spring of 2013. However, the game's status was in doubt shortly after the announcement when the company went through a period of layoffs.\n\nIn May 2013, PopCap Games released a trailer revealing a sequel to the first game, titled Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time. The game was soft-launched for the iOS in Australia and New Zealand on July 10, 2013, and was officially released on August 14, 2013, as a freemium title. The game featured new locations and plants along with the addition of plant food, a power-up that can be used to enhance a plant for a short period and can either be bought using in-game currency or acquired by defeating zombies that are glowing green.\n\nIn July 2019, EA announced Plants vs. Zombies 3, another free-to-play mobile title in the series. It was launched in a pre-alpha state for Android in July 2019. The game soft-launched in February 2020 in the Philippines, Romania, and Ireland. It was then made unavailable in October 2020, becoming unplayable in November 2020. EA has plans to release an improved version of the game in the future. On September 7, 2021, Plants vs. Zombies 3 was soft launched again with substantial changes, such as two-dimensional graphics and the return of the Sunflower as a plantable plant, having the same purpose in the previous iterations.\n\nA spin-off called Plants vs. Zombies Adventures was announced in March 2013 and was released on May 20, 2013, on Facebook. The game added new locations and new plants. It also had a gameplay feature in which the player had a limited amount of plants and had to grow more plants at an in-game farm. In July 2014, it was announced that Plants vs. Zombies Adventures would close on October 12, 2014.\n\nPlants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare was announced at E3 2013 as a multiplayer third-person shooter game made for PC and consoles. Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare was released on February 25, 2014, in North America and on February 27, 2014, in Europe. A sequel, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2, was teased in June 2015 and was officially announced at E3 2015. The game was released on February 23, 2016. On March 10, 2016, PopCap announced Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, a digital collectible card game in the style of tower defense. It was soft released to certain countries on the same day, and was fully released internationally on October 18, 2016.\n\nIn August 2019, a closed beta of a sequel to Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 codenamed \"Picnic\" was made available to select players through invites. And on September 4, 2019, EA announced the sequel's title; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville. It was released in an early access state that same date. The game was fully released on October 18, 2019.", "timestamp_created": 1665324593, "timestamp_updated": 1665324593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107174367": {"recommendationid": "107174367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360635400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1693099866}, "language": "english", "review": "why waste your money on back 4 blood when you can get this instead", "timestamp_created": 1641161809, "timestamp_updated": 1641161809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 900, "votes_funny": 58, "weighted_vote_score": "0.972714900970458984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75756004": {"recommendationid": "75756004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044953654", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 770, "last_played": 1688354202}, "language": "english", "review": "If i was going to die and the make-a-wish people came, i'd wish for the world to have Left 4 Dead 3", "timestamp_created": 1599757424, "timestamp_updated": 1601234908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2533, "votes_funny": 400, "weighted_vote_score": "0.966699123382568359", "comment_count": 37, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75889350": {"recommendationid": "75889350", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987867332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 314780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259219, "last_played": 1692324707}, "language": "english", "review": "You can easily get hooked on this game and play forever. 5 out of 5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1599974862, "timestamp_updated": 1599974862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 886, "votes_funny": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.96417468786239624", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106003834": {"recommendationid": "106003834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161422818", "num_games_owned": 1386, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 21613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "playtime_at_review": 14263, "last_played": 1696025363}, "language": "english", "review": "Even after 12 years, its still the best Co-op Zombie Shooter around.\n\n...and yes, it is better than B4B (can be even more better with Workshop mods).", "timestamp_created": 1639785631, "timestamp_updated": 1639785631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 567, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.964038252830505371", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92021895": {"recommendationid": "92021895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326414956", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 19856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1570, "last_played": 1652709708}, "language": "english", "review": "Every steam library needs L4D2.", "timestamp_created": 1621057057, "timestamp_updated": 1621057057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 448, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.957419216632843018", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77115128": {"recommendationid": "77115128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170028306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 164462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 6429, "last_played": 1696095997}, "language": "english", "review": "You never really stop playing Left 4 Dead 2.

It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.\n\nThere's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!\n\nAlso you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.\n\nThere's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like.

However, single player is difficult due to less-than-stellar AI, multiplayer even more so due to its less-than-stellar community. Your best bet is to find or bring three friends, and I'm sure you'll have a blast.\n\nIf you decide to fly solo and confront the community on your own, please complete the maps in single player, with friends, or on easy campaign online and learn their layouts before proceeding to Versus or higher difficulties. This will result in lower rates of vote kicking. But you will probably still be vote-kicked. Don't take it too personally.\n\nDon't forget to check out the Workshop. Whether you like serious and well-crafted maps, or turning your game into an anime rendition of Ghostbusters, your experience will be 100% more enjoyable.\n\nThat's it.

Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent.\n\nIt is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much.\n\nYou will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome.\n\nTo me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better.\n\nI have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously.

But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.\n\nWithout mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.\n\nIf you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.\n\nHOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account.

Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my survivor and level and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well.

The heart and soul of the game lie in the relentless waves of zombies that you and your team must conquer and the joy of teamwork and cooperation that come along with it. The gameplay is nothing short of fantastic, allowing you to focus on the thrill of slaying endless hordes of undead without being burdened by complex mechanics. As a sequel to the beloved original Left 4 Dead, this game lives up to the expectations set by its predecessor. It comes packed with almost everything that made the first game great, and to sweeten the deal, it even includes the original campaigns. However, it's worth noting that while the core gameplay remains exceptional, some players may need to have the ambiance and darker tone of the first installment. Exploring both games provides a richer experience, showcasing the series' evolution. Though Left 4 Dead 2 has a story, it takes a backseat to the heart-pounding co-op gameplay. Let's be honest; the true joy comes from joining forces with friends to survive the relentless onslaught of infection. The camaraderie and excitement of cooperative play overshadow the narrative, but that's precisely what makes Left 4 Dead 2 so addictively fun. This addition is crucial for an unfiltered and unrestricted gaming experience, giving you the freedom to fully enjoy the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 is a masterpiece in co-op survival gaming that captivates players with its action-packed and immersive gameplay.

Genuinely excellent gameplay that more than a few zombie games afterward tried to follow suit or outright rip off to catch the same hype and player base. Even despite that, this game's quality as a zombie wave shooter goes pretty much unmatched. At the time of this review, long long long past this game's release way back 2009, you'll still see active players and servers with boat loads of modifications and custom maps to further extend its life.\n\n All that aside, for anyone who actually hasn't seen or heard of this game, what is L4D? Its a 1-4 player cooperative shooter with optional PvP which doubles that player count. Get from your start point to the next safe house or extraction, clear objectives along the way. While most of campaigns keep their objectives the same, each time you start the spawns in terms of items and enemies are at the whim of the AI director which is more complicated an elaborate than you might think; even adjusting things slightly in your favor or against you depending on how hard a struggle your team has been going through. L4d2 also includes the campaign for L4D1 at this point which makes the previous game obsolete for the most part (unless you had some preference for the balance/exploits of the previous one). There is some overarching story through all the campaigns, but lets be honest here: that's not what anyone comes into this game prioritizing. The horde attacks can get wild and frenzied, really testing team cohesion and readiness especially with a variety of specials pitched into the mix.\n\nIn short: you can't go wrong with having this game in your library. Between the excellent design as a cooperative shooter, the optional competitive mode to play as special infected, and the staggering library of workshop mods now around to keep your game fresh even after you've cleared all the campaign maps to exhaustion I can say that this is Valve title that continues to outlive other titles that try to replace it.", "timestamp_created": 1700918284,
