slash-em-up with action that is an absolute adrenaline rush. Taking more than a few cues from [b]Hotline Miami[/b], it is largely about a drug-addicted neo-noir-inspired samurai who sticks a bunch of needles in his body. It wears its inspirations on the sleeves of its kimono but refines the tried and true one-hit-kill formula in a manner that makes it feels fresh, exciting, and innovative in surprising ways.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\u00bb This game puts you in control of a nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future. In an extremely clever and fun framing of the action, every level is contextualized as being the planning of an assassination. So, instead of your character dying, you are told \u201cNo\u2026 That won\u2019t work,\u201d as your precognition rewinds to the start (complete with old-timey VCR effect), giving you a chance to find a solution that does not end in your death. Every level ends with a security camera recording of what \u201cactually\u201d happened, which serves not only as a way to see your moment of triumph played back but also to subvert expectations in interesting ways later on.\n\nWorking up to that moment is a blast because Katana Zero\u2019s action is fast-paced and empoweringly flexible. Like Hotline Miami, it is one shot, one kill for both you and any enemy that is not a boss. Your character can slash in eight directions, slow down time, use a dodge roll to avoid bullets or reflect bullets back with his sword. There is a great flow and feel to your character\u2019s movement thanks to small touches like how each sword swing gives you a slight boost of momentum, or how you can cancel out of any roll, and the way each kill gives a satisfying screen-shake and pause to the action.\n\nHowever, the most iconic feature of this platformer is the slow-mo effect \u2013 specifically, how optional it is. It never feels too strong; it is on a pretty strict cooldown, and since enemies will hear whenever gunfire rings out, you will rarely have time to stay safe long enough for it to replenish. This puts it in a perfect spot as a powerful ability to get you through a tough situation while still being limited enough to keep the action quick.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\u00bb The story of Katana Zero does not quite hit the high note that its action does, but it is at least carried by strong writing and a few great characters, such as your boss/therapist that guides you through your traumatic past while also providing you with the dossiers of people he wants dead, as well as a psychotic Russian adversary named V. It unfolds in a dystopian neo-noir setting, where you are entangled in a web of conspiracies and government experiments. Exploring deep themes of trauma, identity, and the consequences of one's actions, Katana Zero poses itself as a dark and mature tale, artfully woven into the fabric of the gameplay experience.\n\nFor instance, there is an innovative dialogue system that allows players to choose unique options based on their timing and interjections. By rudely shutting down conversations or patiently listening, players can unlock different dialogue paths, adding entertaining depth to the game. However, while these choices provide multiple playthrough opportunities, the story deviations feel superficial, and later dialogue options can be inconsistent with previous decisions. Additionally, the game\u2019s narrative leaves much unresolved, hinting at a potential sequel or DLC, but the lack of payoff in this first chapter may leave players feeling unsatisfied.\n\nWhile Katana Zero will not take more than four to six hours to complete, it is a very tight four to six hours that cuts out any fluff. It never feels like it is running out of ideas, and every level does a great job of introducing small twists to its simple formula, from an underground minecart level to a motorcycle chase sequence on the city highway.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\u00bb It also helps that everything looks and sounds great. The slick neon aesthetic and fantastic sprite work go hand in hand with some legitimately impressive 2D lighting effects that give this game a unique visual style and personality. Accompanied by a fitting and catchy retro-electro soundtrack, the audio elements perfectly complement the intense action.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\u00bb All in all, Katana Zero\u2019s time-bending samurai action is the star of the show here, but it's unique presentation and entertaining dialogue go a long way in supporting a plot that suffers from feeling like it is saving its best ideas for a sequel. As action games go, the game\u2019s shorter length makes it a quick fix, and I\u2019ll no doubt suffer withdrawal while I wait for the next hit.\n\n[h1][b]Score: 8.7/10[/b][/h1]\n\n[b][i]Was this review helpful?[/i][/b]\n\u00bb If so, please leave a rating.

A brainless main character just running errands. To my delight (and I hope yours too) how things turn around. The gameplay loop is the one who doesn't move from those initial moments, heavily inspired by Hotline, it delivers the same thrills and frustrating moments.\n\nWhat makes this game shine then? The story and characters are truly remarkable. Each interaction can evolve into deep topics, it is well crafted and full of 'I wasn't expecting that reaction' moments.

I played this game about a year ago. It took me two or three days to go through most of the content the game had to offer. And I still can't stop thinking about it since then.\n\nKatana ZERO is a game that has essentially no flaws, at least in my opinion. We'll play as Zero, dubbed \"the Dragon\" for his brutality, a man dressed as a samurai (much to the amusement of other characters) that seems to work as a hitman although not even he knows why or for who.  He just knows he has to carry out these hitman tasks, given to him through the psychiatrist that treats him, because Zero has lost most of his memories and doesn't remember who he is, aside from a recurring nightmare that haunts him. What he does have, however, is the power of seeing the immediate future.\n\nUsing this power, he can infiltrate facilities and buildings without being seen, anticipating each of his enemies' movements and making a perfect plan to kill everything in sight. This way, the segments you play are actually Zero's plan, and once you've managed to defeat all opponents in a level, you'll see Zero redo exactly what you did (so a replay), carrying out the plan, but with no bullet-time (did I forget to mention that's a thing too?). This is the way the game explains dying, which you will do, a lot. It's a one hit death for everyone, both you and your enemies, so you will need some trial and error in each level to find out the best way to carry your task. This, if you ask me, is a genius way of explaining death in a video game.\n\nThese are the most interesting gameplay points, but definitely not the only good thing the game has to offer. The story is amazing and the way it's told to you is organic and fluid, featuring some great twists, the graphics are beautiful pixel art and the animations are very carefully crafted, the characters are charismatic and well written, the dialogues are entertaining and often funny, the gameplay is super satisfying, everything is just perfect. The game also counts with enough replayability mechanics, which is nice because the game isn't specially long. There are secrets to uncover, new weapons with different ranges and speeds, different paths to take and even a speedrun mode.\n\nThe single flaw this game has is that it's not finished. The game doesn't have an ending and the story cuts abruptly. However, it's known that a DLC with more content is being worked on, so I'm not worried about that.

[spoiler]they added a new soundtrack and new sound effects to the V boss fight and it's so funny. they added some funny details, like they changed the police car symbols to spirits and dragons, also they added 15's soldier outfit for the tape which was nice. they turned slaughter house to meat facility and it's so freaking funny, also in the bunker you see the body of bunch of nulls in the army suit that 0 and 15 wear, I personally think this will become some important part of the story in the future. I just finished the game, they changed the secret boss fight to a dragon and it's so freaking cool, once again,[/spoiler] you guys who worked on this have my thanks.", "timestamp_created": 1680822290,

is a stylistic indie action game about a conspiracy involving supersoldiers, war crimes, and using cosplay as a cover while you assassinate someone. It features frenetic gameplay where the titular character slices and dices through waves of Greasers with just a sword. Death can happen with a single hit but players are allowed to rewind and retry as many times as their patience allows. After each segment, players watch a short replay in real time, making them appear quite skillful, but this can be a negative that disrupts the otherwise Mach 5 pace of the game. In my opinion, the replay should be at the end of each level.\n\nWhat might surprise players is the strength and quality of Katana Zero's narrative, as it uses unconventional storytelling and unreliable narration to tell a dark but believable story of PTSD set in a bleak, dystopian world. There are moments showcasing the shocking nature of humanity but it never borders on pretentiousness or over-indulgence. Accompanying the plot is an excellently produced soundtrack featuring brooding synths by Ludowic and catchy house-like pieces by Bill Kiley. \n\nIf I had a nickel for every time Devolver published a colorful, hyper-violent, one-hit death game about a protagonist threatened by Russians, I'd have two nickels.

It offers plenty of fun gameplay as you master your abilities, and a fairly free ability to make the story evolve as you want to along with a pumping soundtrack. I highly recommend playing it if you haven\u2019t already, though an average run only last a few hours.\n \n[b]Story[/b]\nYou play as an amnesic katana wielding assassin who can slow down time and uses precognitive abilities to plan your path through stages. I found the story great, and it had plenty of twists I didn\u2019t expect and kept me guessing as to what was real and what the character was imagining until it all came together in the end, though there are a few lose plot points I wish the game explored further. It feels heavily influenced by the Vietnam War, and has equivalents of a lot of controversial topics. Between each mission you have therapy sessions with your shrink to help with your PSTD from the war you fought in, and nightmares after each completed mission. Depending on how targets were eliminated, dialogue options you pick and if you follow orders the story re-frames itself, which can keep you (the player) in the dark about what is happening, or completely change your perception of what\u2019s happening. Are you a war vet having a mental breakdown, a pawn of a clandestine shadowy government operation, or something else? I didn\u2019t see the ending coming, which totally puts a different slant on the entire game.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nWow. I found this seriously fun to play. The gameplay is simple, but requires a good deal of precision as you dodge, slow down time, throw object and reflect bullets back at enemies as you work towards each target. Even being out slightly results in death, and results in a restart of the screen you are on, but thankfully each stage is small so you aren\u2019t losing tons of time and effort with each death. Each of the stages is well designed, with a few different options for you to move around as you murder your way through to your target. Every enemy needs to be dealt with, you mission guidelines don\u2019t allow you to leave anyone alive. After each mission you have the option of watching your run, which I thought was fairly cool.\n\nEnemies are copies of each other so you know their attack profiles, and while they might be generic they are deadly. All of them are crack shots if you are standing still or not using your abilities, and throw in some of the traps found in each stage or environmental hazards makes for interesting combat. You have a few different one time objects you can find scattered across each stage which can be thrown at enemies or used to help you progress. \n\nThe game isn\u2019t afraid to change things up, some missions have you progressing while remaining unseen (like sneaking into a prison or nightclub), and encourage you to not kill anyone, while a later stages has you babysitting a mining kart while racing to hit the track mechanisms to keep it moving. There\u2019s a stage where you are chasing down a boss and killing mobs while riding a motorbike down the highway, and a stage where you control someone else who has similar abilities to you but is more in control of them.\n\nBoss fights are interesting, with some of them skipping ahead if you fail enough, but most require the precision fighting techniques to pass, and become easier when you have the patterns figured out. The hidden boss fight was a great Akria reference!\n\nThe game has some replayabilitiy in the fact that you can load up missions and change your response to certain areas, which can change future outcomes. This can change what you experience in the nightmares and potentially opens up a secret boss, as well as achievements. There is also a hard mode and speed run mode for those who wish to test themselves. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe game is pixel based, but looks great with that aesthetic. As you kill enemies, the blood sprays over the walls and furniture, leaving you painting the stages with enemy\u2019s blood. It\u2019s easy to tell where you are and if enemies can see you or if they are alerted, though I ran into a few instances where the enemies were shooting at me from off screen. Depending on the character\u2019s state of mind screen distortion or other effects can occur which messes with you, and feeds into the story. I didn\u2019t experience any issues or bugs while playing the game, it feels highly polished.\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nThe soundtrack is heavily synth based, with a large dose of drums. I found the soundtrack great to listen to, with their being plenty of variety and the mission music kind of energising you, while the music outside of stages feeling dark.

A fast-paced slasher-platformer with instant death and time manipulation. It's easier than you'd expect (from Hotline Miami for example) but still non-trivial, and you can choose not to use time slowdown. But let's be honest: gameplay is not the main draw here, at least it wasn't for me.\n\nIt's the story. More specifically, the way it's told.\n\nThe game takes the concept of \"unreliable narrator\" and runs with it... but just carefully enough to make you actually wonder what's real and what's not. Classic Noir; and Katana ZERO iterates on this concept with creative usage of glitchcore. And when you throw in some serious mental health issues and drugs into the mix... well, the result is potent.\n\nThen, there's the aesthetic. Some people think that pixel art is \"bad graphics\"; I won't insult you by assuming you're one of them. Instead I'll point out that the sprites are detailed and expressive, and the animations are very smooth with lots and lots of frames. They're also very varied - for example, there's a mission that takes place in a club, and there's an animation of the protagonist dancing - just for this one room. \n\nOn the topic of clubs; the music is very fitting. \"Dark synthwave\" would be my best attempt to categorise it? Slower, heavier Carpenter Brut? A little like Hotline Miami's, but less flashy? I don't know, I review games, not music.\n\nFinally, I have a complaint. The game's story isn't self-contained - it ends on a cliffhanger of sorts. Still, it's a Noir story, so a certain lack of closure is fitting. Besides, the rest is so good I can forgive this little thing.\n\nWith all that said, I don't think Katana ZERO is as good as the reviews make it look. It's polished and has interesting narration, but something felt missing the entire time I was playing. Maybe I simply didn't like the gameplay all that much. Maybe the plot was  too... \"snuff\" for me. Or maybe I found the general story a little too vague. But overall I had fun and the plot kept my attention, and I'd say the game's definitely worth playing.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator Page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1668787844, "timestamp_updated": 1668787844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618448615074157715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129913212": {"recommendationid": "129913212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178825249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1673275823}, "language": "english", "review": "Katana ZERO", "timestamp_created": 1672635526, "timestamp_updated": 1672635526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617354750633239746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144831385": {"recommendationid": "144831385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089669597", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1695986196}, "language": "english", "review": "game gud and fucks with my mind. you literally do not know what is going to happen next. i love it.\n\ni also played this game during my spa session while paused on the menu. the sensual ost got me vibin'", "timestamp_created": 1692762783, "timestamp_updated": 1692769121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613962709903717041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129319302": {"recommendationid": "129319302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305273635", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1684648821}, "language": "english", "review": "i have had my hair up ever since i finished this game", "timestamp_created": 1672044330, "timestamp_updated": 1672262539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612965762615203857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135358303": {"recommendationid": "135358303", "author": {"steamid": "76561199116902979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1682133221}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game where you do drugs and run around with a sword.

You're a crazy bathrobe samurai living in a cruddy apartment and you have a dependency for \"chronos,\" a die-and-rewind drug that has permanently screwed up your sense of time.  You gotta have it; if you don't, time will freeze for you and you'll be stuck in a single, subjective moment forever.  \n\nThe feels, the kills:  Cool story interludes in a 32-bit futuristic city after a devastating war.  Psychiatrist is your handler and dope-giver.  Blood flash-sprays everywhere when you kill.  Cartoon goofball humor is mixed in with the serious bits -- anime-like in that regard.  Slow down time to surgically slash and roll past gunfire; fight a few tough bosses who are chemically or genetically modified; choose your dialogue or literally skip it with an imprecation or [i]brusque grunt[/i]; reflect bullets back at gunmen with well-timed swings.  \n\nI really can't find anything to dislike about this super-fun game, other than that the story is not complete -- but the devs are working on free DLC to shore that up.  I feel like, for now, full-price is pretty steep if you're not figuring on getting gold in the Time Attack mode after you beat the brief and unfinished -- but very action-packed -- main campaign.

Most rooms require you to evaluate the situation and find the correct plan of action, and then execute that plan of action with decent window in-between each action. Choosing which enemy to kill first, which barrels to shoot, whether or not you should stealth a section, the game has plenty of variety in approaching situations and its amazing. Some of the situations do offer quite a bit of challenge, especially the boss fights.\n\nThat's just the gameplay though, the small segments in-between each killing floor really flesh this game out even further. The dialogue options you are given when speaking with the \"therapist\", the small talk you can make with the receptionist, it's not necessary at all but the fact that it's there elevates the series tremendously. The story is also fantastic, with you questioning \"What the fuck is going on?\" quite often. I got very invested in the story and I eagerly await the DLC. \n\nThe 2D art style is also fantastic. The blood and gore in the scenes look great. My only detractor from the game would be that the stealth sections are kind of a drag if you choose that route. Dying requires you to keep doing them over again and waiting, but you do always have the option of going weapons loud. It's just you'll have to deal with the potential story consequences later.\n\n[b] I would HEAVILY recommend that everyone pick-up this indie classic!

Your experience on other versions may vary.[/u][/b]\n\n[h3][b][u]Short Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] A fast-paced action platformer dripping with style and quality at (almost) every turn. The gameplay, art direction, and soundtrack are all stellar; and the only sore spot for me is the fact that its otherwise captivating story is, as of writing this, incomplete (but may be resolved with the promised free DLC). An absolute blast to play, and getting a resolution to the story would likely cement it as one of my all-time favorites.\n\n[b][u]NOTE[/u]: Players with photosensitive epilepsy will probably need to skip this one due to rapid flashing imagery and intense visual effects, which might be too much even after disabling all relevant graphical settings.[/b]\n\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Katana ZERO[/i] is an action platformer where you play as a swordsman with the power of precognition, able to foresee possible futures and determine the path to survival in even the deadliest encounters. He works as a killer for hire for a secret organization with equally secret motives, but his newest string of missions will force him to question everything he thought he knew--but to say anything beyond that would do the story, and you, a disservice. I'll be blunt and say that I had a lot of fun with this game; and were it not for one glaring flaw--one that may be resolved in the not-too-distant future--I would probably consider this one of my favorite games in recent years.\n\nGameplay consists of a bit of platforming and a lot of fast-paced hack-and-slash combat, where a single hit from an enemy will kill you and send you back to the start of the level. Your only weapon is a katana that you can swing in all directions, but you've got a few other tricks up your sleeve as well: you can throw small objects to kill enemies, dodge roll through obstacles, deflect bullets with your blade, and even slow down time to pull off tricky stunts more easily. [b]It's a game that expects you to die often[/b], even setting up traps to force trial and error on occasion; [b]but it's relatively frustration-free despite that[/b]. Individual level segments are small and everything moves at a brisk pace, so dying never costs you more than maybe 60 seconds of progress at most. It also ties nicely into the story: the gameplay segments are framed as being visions from your character's future sight and don't actually go into effect until you've successfully cleared the level, making death feel less like a failure state and more like an extension of the narrative. It doesn't sound like much, but stuff like this can go a long way towards reducing stress even when the gameplay is at its toughest. As someone who can get easily frustrated with games at times, I can only count one or two sections where I felt even mildly annoyed despite dying a few hundred times in my playthrough.\n\nThis doesn't have much to do with the normal gameplay, but I want to briefly mention the unique dialogue system, because it took me by surprise in a very good way. You have the ability to pick one of several dialogue choices whenever you enter a conversation, and these choices can change depending on how fast you choose to respond. Waiting until someone finishes their block of text will give you the standard responses, but interjecting early lets you pick a more direct or aggressive response that can change the direction of the whole conversation or even end it prematurely. This system is even used [spoiler]as a puzzle mechanic in the mid-game, and you can unlock some hidden achievements and late-game content depending on the choices you make[/spoiler]. It might not be that big of a deal for most players, but I thought it was really cool and deserved some recognition.\n\nThe solid gameplay loop alone might've been enough for me to recommend, but they went ahead and knocked it out of the park in nearly every other aspect of its design as well. [b]The visuals are just fantastic[/b], making the most of its pixel art style with detailed environments, gorgeous color palettes, great use of shading, and surprisingly fluid animations. Everything is full of visual flair, even down to the text boxes and their range of effects and animations that emphasize the tone of a conversation so nothing is left to the imagination. [b]The music is also great[/b], and it's actually the thing that first put the game on my radar. It features a lot of techno music straight out of an '80s-inspired cyberpunk/outrun playlist, while sprinkling in some jazz and atmospheric electronic tracks to punctuate the calm moments that break up the action. On both fronts, it's some of the best of its kind.\n\nContinuing the theme, [b]the story matches the same high quality as everything else...for the most part[/b]. It was interesting, full of twists and turns, and managed to utilize--and sometimes even manipulate--every other element I've mentioned previously to tell a story that I don't think could ever be told through anything other than a video game. With all that said, there is one big thing going against it, one that I could understand being a dealbreaker for some players: [b]as of writing this, the story is incomplete[/b]. It ends on a cliffhanger, without resolving the bulk of its biggest plot threads, leaving behind only a \"To Be Continued\" since it originally launched four years ago. Now, they [i]have[/i] been working on free DLC that's said to be over half the size of the base game, so presumably we'll get our conclusion from that whenever it finally comes out.

That's Katana Zero in a nutshell. Developed by Askiisoft, this 2D side-scrolling action adventure thrusts you into the shoes of Zero, an amnesiac samurai with a deadly task and a unique ability to manipulate time thanks to a mind-bending drug.\n\nAs Zero, you gracefully dodge, slice, and deflect through stages, feeling like a true sword-wielding badass. Bullet time becomes your trusty companion, allowing you to orchestrate cinematic carnage with style. While the gameplay is solid, it does have its limitations. The combat, while polished, can feel a bit restrained due to a limited variety of enemies and environments.\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting. The game's repetitive nature isn't a flaw, it's a feature. You'll replay encounters multiple times to perfect your moves, fitting right into the theme of mastery through defeat. There's something oddly satisfying about nailing that scenario after a dozen attempts, but it can also start to feel a bit predictable.\n\nThe story adds layers to this repetition. Zero is no typical hero; he's a loner with a tragic reliance on Chronos, the time-altering drug. It's a double-edged sword \u2013 it grants power but exacts a heavy price. The story deftly explores the choices he faces: endless violence or a plunge into oblivion.\n\nInteractive moments and dialogue choices give you some control over Zero's journey. These segments, while not drastically affecting the main plot, deepen your connection with him and his struggles. The narrative unfolds against a backdrop of dark, meticulously animated scenes that blend seamlessly with the gameplay.\n\nThe game's atmosphere oozes neon-lit grit, with pulsating music enhancing both action-packed sequences and story-driven dialogues. Sure, Katana Zero can be a bit grim at times, and the gameplay variety isn't groundbreaking, but it still manages to captivate. The game's unique style and sincere storytelling make it stand out even in its cynical and sometimes ugly world.\n\nSo, if you're up for a dose of samurai action with a twist of time manipulation and a side of introspection, Katana Zero could be your next gaming adventure!", "timestamp_created": 1693068806, "timestamp_updated": 1693071231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135073376": {"recommendationid": "135073376", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026875550", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1679367488}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best pixel art games with decent combat and amazing story.

Katana Zero has the most impressive story I've seen in a game recently. Even in your short playing time of 4-4.5 hours, the game makes you adopt its characters and make you feel happy, sad, hate and fear for them. At the same time, since we determine all the dialogues of our main character Zero, we create his character completely by ourselves. If you want, you can create an aggressive character who interrupts others before they finish speaking, or you can turn him into a good-natured and kind person. Or, as I did, I created a character who was bored with life and snapped at people at first, but when a little girl whose name I didn't even know joined the game, both me and my character changed. Of course, this diversity makes it extremely easy to put yourself in the character's shoes. On the other hand, the story presentation is very high quality and the side characters are above average. The only bad or missing part of the story for me is that it ends the game without giving the player some answers. Normally I like this storytelling as long as it's in moderation, but in Katana Zero, almost no questions are answered at the end of the game and new questions are added. This makes the ending less impressive for me.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay. In terms of gameplay, Katana Zero is quite similar to Hotline Miami. Katana Zero has a structure that asks you to die multiple times in each episode, learn the episodes completely with a single life, develop special tactics for each episode and play accordingly. The level designs are really impressive and the level variety is very high. There are really 10s of different chapter types. But besides that, the number of chapters that repeat each other in terms of basic logic, if not completely, is quite high. This is one of the cons of the game for me. Although the number of boss fights is quite low, the ones that are there are quite high quality. At the same time, some bosses can really annoy you with their difficulty. This makes the player feel a sense of accomplishment very well.\n\nFinally, soundtracks of Katana Zero can be both moving and exhilarating at the same time and to summarize them in one word: Perfect.\n\nPros\n-Excellent story and presentation\n-Adopting characters\n-Level design\n-Section diversity\n-Fast and enjoyable gameplay\n-Challenging and high quality bosses, each designed differently\n-Perfect soundtracks\n\nCons\n-The story leaves many questions unanswered\n-Some sections in a repetitive style\n-Few bosses\n\nI would recommend everyone to play this truly impressive game.", "timestamp_created": 1686611208, "timestamp_updated": 1690031677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139930468": {"recommendationid": "139930468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966123831", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1686556209}, "language": "english", "review": "back to the past, back to the past, samurai jack.

The pixel art is charming and its good sci-fi narrative fights with the excellent gameplay for being the best part of the game.\n\n This is a game that shines a lot during its story and allows the player to choose some lines during the game.[b] I recommend staying away from spoilers[/b]. Briefly, the game starts from the premise that the protagonist does not remember the past and currently works assassinating targets for his employer.\n\n The game has simple mechanics to learn but difficult to master, as your weapon is just a katana you are limited to killing your enemies quickly and short, being able to dodge rolling bullets or hitting them during their trajectory. The game's gimmick comes from the main ability to slow down time, allowing you to escape or even kill your enemies at crucial moments. Another factor is that failing is part of the game, progress is retained until you eliminate all enemies at once, and if you die you can start over from the beginning of the area and try again in another way.\n\n The game has a great replay factor, encouraging discovering secrets in the levels, finishing them faster and even increasing the difficulty with new enemies and unpredictable routes. The narrative also gains a lot from this, letting you experience several dialogues in different ways to explore the protagonist's story and the world in which he lives.\n", "timestamp_created": 1681229937, "timestamp_updated": 1681229937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136278847": {"recommendationid": "136278847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963169763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 985, "last_played": 1690450042}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043a", "timestamp_created": 1680881735, "timestamp_updated": 1680881735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136237558": {"recommendationid": "136237558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968856044", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1680822860}, "language": "english", "review": "DLC....one...day...", "timestamp_created": 1680822897, "timestamp_updated": 1680822897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135979747": {"recommendationid": "135979747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246856174", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 938, "last_played": 1680461643}, "language": "english", "review": "i love banishing evil spirits", "timestamp_created": 1680461738, "timestamp_updated": 1680461738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135776120": {"recommendationid": "135776120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882178241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 150, "playtime_at_review": 923, "last_played": 1695707585}, "language": "english", "review": " KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD KILL THE CHILD", "timestamp_created": 1680227557, "timestamp_updated": 1680227557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135701856": {"recommendationid": "135701856", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045775156", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1688154135}, "language": "english", "review": "Katana zero is the greatest game to ever touch my eyes.

It features enjoyable gameplay where the pace is mostly decided by you the player due to your ability to slow down time. This can be used as a safety net when facing several enemies or to clear a room in the perfect way, but you can also ignore it and run through the levels at normal speed, but this is quite risky, since even though the enemies die in one hit, so do you.\n\nSpeaking of the levels, they're all unique and distinct from each other, both visually and mechanically, typically having a feature that separates it from the rest, such as riding a motorcycle, having a special dash or stealth mechanics. The one thing consistent throughout all of them have is the amazing edm/synthwave soundtrack.\n\nThe story is intriguing but quite cryptic, and since it leaves many questions unanswered and ends on a cliffhanger the developer has yet to follow up on you may be left wanting more, but unfortunately there's yet to be a release date for the new content. \n\nThat doesn't mean there's nothing to do after beating the game for the first time though, since there's several new swords you can unlock through keys hidden throughout the levels. There's also a speedrun mode where you can focus on clearing the stages as fast as possible and perfecting your strategy without being interrupted by the story elements.\n\nOverall I recommend it, it's an enjoyable experience that's memorable and feels like the evolution of a genre made popular by Hotline Miami.", "timestamp_created": 1672663458, "timestamp_updated": 1672663980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129907271": {"recommendationid": "129907271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365690699", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1680403149}, "language": "english", "review": "cool game.", "timestamp_created": 1672628807, "timestamp_updated": 1676972284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129898726": {"recommendationid": "129898726", "author": {"steamid": "76561199331036327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1672082882}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game", "timestamp_created": 1672619230, "timestamp_updated": 1672619230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129845465": {"recommendationid": "129845465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391302744", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1674375086}, "language": "english", "review": "sword go brr", "timestamp_created": 1672569653, "timestamp_updated": 1672569653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129788324": {"recommendationid": "129788324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161597000", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1672500891}, "language": "english", "review": "Makes me want to try drugs", "timestamp_created": 1672503859, "timestamp_updated": 1672504093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129711862": {"recommendationid": "129711862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316586768", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1403, "last_played": 1692255259}, "language": "english", "review": "You really shouldn't need another review to convince you to play this game, but since you did, I'll be the guy to write it.

Every level can become a freestyle of movement while swiftly assassinating anyone in your path. The story is immersive and there's plenty of extra lore you can notice while replaying, this is probably the only game that has made me cry from the story alone. The OST manages to not be distracting from the game while it plays in the background, yet engaging while listening outside of the game. Easily one of my favorite OSTs, probably second to Persona 5. There's also a free DLC that will be coming out sometime in the near future, so get pumped for that because you almost certainly WILL be craving more after finishing this game. It took me about four hours to complete the story, and I think roughly 16 hours to 100% it, could be a little off on that one though.

Checkpoints are placed properly which means that if I had to restart a room then I wouldn't have to do a whole lot of backtracking to get back to where I died. Sometimes the rooms are bigger so you do have to learn patterns since enemies die in one hit but so does Zero, the main character (MC). \n\nWithout spoilers, the story follows our MC who is a byproduct of an experiment which left him addicted to the drug that gives him enhanced perception of his surroundings (or the ability to slow time, depending which theory you follow). To get his fix and uncover his own past, he has to perform multiple assassination jobs.\nFor a few hours the story is far more complex than I originally expected, not to mention that we'd need Katana ZERO 2 for any hope of clarifying some of the mysteries presented so far. \n\nThe pixel art is accompanied by a really solid soundtrack that's worth listening even after you're done with the game. There's also a bit of exploring to do if you want to complete the achievements since most of them are easy to miss if you don't know what to do or where to look. \n\nAt the time of writing this review, they also announced a DLC for this game ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/460950/view/3315234367099075717?l=english] here [/url])  that they claim is going to be free of charge for the owners of the base game. \n\nHighly recommended, especially if you like fast paced games.", "timestamp_created": 1671360568, "timestamp_updated": 1671360568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128724509": {"recommendationid": "128724509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318607400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1648234400}, "language": "english", "review": "*swoosh* (sound effects for sword)", "timestamp_created": 1671281871, "timestamp_updated": 1671281871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128619669": {"recommendationid": "128619669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349332515", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1459, "last_played": 1685552878}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved it when the katana man said to sword man \"this is truly katana zero\"", "timestamp_created": 1671130878, "timestamp_updated": 1671130878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128460282": {"recommendationid": "128460282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961070318", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1673212611}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, snappy, relentlessly stylish, and overwhelmingly confident in its flawlessly executed vision. 5/5\n\n(Time played is borked because I played on my Deck in offline mode.

The pixel art looks great and the animations are clear and smooth. The soundtrack is great and sets the tone quite well. The writing is also great, it\u2019s not too cryptic that it\u2019s hard to follow and the characters are interesting. It just felt like it ended a bit too soon. \nFinally, the gameplay was very fun. I\u2019m not usually crazy about 2D platformers, but this game was fun enough for that to not matter. To put it simply, you\u2019re going through levels killing every enemy where both you and the enemies all die in 1 hit. You can slow down time to help you, and from there it\u2019s up to you to decide how you will tackle each level. Part of it is trying to be stealthy, and part of it is running into a run full of armed men and and deciding which enemies will die first. You can slice bullets back at enemies, and pick up items to throw at enemies or detonate explosives. You have a lot of tools at your disposal, and the developers did a good job at slowly introducing new items, enemies, and mechanics. The developers were very creative with the time manipulation concept, and it\u2019s clear when you play this game just how much love and care was put into making this game. \n\nSadly, this game isn\u2019t very long, lasting just over 4 hours for my first playthrough. However, if you find yourself enthralled by the gameplay, there is some level of replay-ability. Once you beat the game you unlock speedrun mode and hard mode, and you can challenge yourself to beat the game without the ability to slow down time in the speedrun settings. Overall, I\u2019d give the game a try, it has a lot of style and is very well made.

When you tag enemies or deflect bullets with your sword or throw paraphernalia at them, they turn into a gory mess. The enemies will knock out the player character in one hit too. I skipped the story because it is unfinished, unsubstantiated, and uninteresting. There is a little bit of time-wasting bloat like push button to drink tea and push button to go to sleep. Some characters ask you if you want to keep playing the game or not as well. The mentally unwell protagonist's psychiatrist is also his case officer for assassinating drug dealers, which involves the player exercising careful aggression on enemies unaware of your presence. He also prescribes a drug that gives clairvoyance, which translates to having the player slow down time during combat. Katana Zero will most likely take 1 or 2 days to finish.

the only game I have ever played that rivals Toby Fox in its storytelling. This game is PHENOMENAL. The gameplay is quick and easy to understand, the soundtrack is great, and the storytelling is out of this world. The plot is very similar to an RPG, where the important moments in the story are told through cutscenes where you choose dialogue options. Normally I am frustrated by scenes like this, but it ended up being the part of the game that I most anticipated. It is a very short game, I finished it in about six hours, but it's well worth it's $15 price tag, and has ABSOLUTELY made an impression on me that will take a loooong time to shake off. Let me explain.\nLike many other story-centered games, you start the game knowing nothing. You're placed into a mysterious world, with no instruction besides how to move your character. As you go, you learn more and more about the playable character, the world he lives in, and his dark, mysterious past. It is similar to a mystery game in that you are given snippets of information in doses, with each one increasing your curiosity and interest. It got to the point where it felt like I was \"getting through\" the already amazing gameplay in order to discover the next piece of the story.\nThe soundtrack is not the kind of thing I would jam to when cleaning dishes or some other tedious activity. I'm not as quick to listen to it for fun as most soundtracks, but it does an incredible job of setting the mood. It has a very electric, neon, dance-party type soundtrack that sets the mood of the game perfectly. The main levels have energetic, adrenaline-pumping tracks, calmer cutscenes have beautiful, relaxing music, and the intense parts of the game have some of the most raw-intensity music I've heard in gaming.\nFor a game so focused on story, the gameplay isn't actually that bad. I've never been sure how to describe it, so I've always just called it a hack-and-slash, 2-D, puzzle game (think 2-D SUPERHOT but with just a Katana). The protagonists abilities are very easy to understand, so the complexity and variety comes in the great level design. It feels like I'm playing as an anime protagonist, but it's an anime with some really sick action scenes. However one of the few flaws I picked up on in this game is that the combat can occasionally get really spammy. Your character is a very balanced kind of overpowered, so I've had multiple moments where I've spent 10-15 minutes working really hard to strategize a way out of the level to no avail but in a fit of anger I eventually mashed in random directions, and it worked 5x better than when I was trying to strategize. While this very rarely happened, it's imo a flaw in the game design, however small.\nI do have one more word of caution, but it is definitely not going on my \"con's list\" because somehow it's one of the reasons I love this game so much. This game is disturbing. The friend who recommended the game to me kept me away from it for a little while, and, while I'm so glad I played this game, I'm also glad I waited till I was more mature before I chose to play it. If you've watched game of thrones or invincible or other intense shows like that, you'll get what I mean by 'disturbing.' It's a 2-D pixelart game, so most of the gore isn't a huge deal, but there are occasional moments when they will ramp it up. One character gets blown up, many characters get shot, you literally kill dozens of enemies with your katana, and one time you take someone's head off and use it for a facial scan. I debated on spoiling a fraction of the ending as an example here, but it really hits the most going in blind. Needless to say it's an incredibly shocking ending. I actually avoided listening to the soundtrack or playing the game, or even thinking about it for like, a week after finishing the game because of how intense the ending is. While I very very highly recommend you play this game (I'm a total feather and I made it through ok) proceed with caution, because sometimes amazing storytelling is a double-edged sword.\nIn the end, I consider Katana Zero to be an unbelievably creative game, with super enjoyable gameplay, a great soundtrack, and a groundbreaking story that had a much bigger effect on me than I expected.\nPlease play this game.\nIt's a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1670386958, "timestamp_updated": 1670386958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513888895511627197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132806493": {"recommendationid": "132806493", "author": {"steamid": "76561199011142476", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1686774629}, "language": "english", "review": "the only problem with the game is that its too short\n\nbesides that, the game does everything flawlessly", "timestamp_created": 1676337942, "timestamp_updated": 1676337942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131123840": {"recommendationid": "131123840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217860893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1242, "last_played": 1674099331}, "language": "english", "review": "I need [h1]CHRONOS[/h1] to split my mind", "timestamp_created": 1674099630, "timestamp_updated": 1674099646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137580407": {"recommendationid": "137580407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828027701", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1684450902}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game, but pretty short.

The game-play is very addicting your able to slow down time deflect bullets cut people in half with your katana and the enemies gets harder as you move along the story (there is a hard mode after you complete the game/speed run mode) even after just completing the game I want to dive back in and experience more action! As for the story is highly investing it sucks you into the life of a samurai now i don't want to give any spoilers but however if you like great stories where your actions have consequences then this one is for you. I am most defiantly replaying this game and see what other outcomes are there. One thing I want to mention is don't be fooled by the graphics of this game and think its low quality. If anything the graphics are perfect for this game and completely fits the tone and vibe. So much thought was put into this game the developers outdone themselves I could tell that they poured their hearts out to make this one all thanks goes to them for making such a phenomenal game.\nwell those are my thoughts on katana ZERO final score is 9/10. \nNow if you'll excuse me I gotta get back to SLAYING.", "timestamp_created": 1670245395, "timestamp_updated": 1670246716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127967287": {"recommendationid": "127967287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057212073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1668022466}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect execution of a game.

Where you end is basically the end of the prelude with the \"real story\" just about to start. There are tons of dangling plot threads. This isn't a \"everything got wrapped up\" kind of Part 1. This is more like Half-Life 2: Episode 2. And it's been 4 years with nothing else.\n\nIt's a problem because what sets this above many of the other Hotline Miami inspired games is the story. But ultimate it ends up going nowhere with no resolution because the game just ends.\n\nThe other reason I lean towards \"no\" is the gameplay has just enough things that are unsatisfying. You see all there is to offer in terms of gameplay reasonably early in the game. You've seen all the enemy types and the general kind of level designs. The gameplay leans a little bit more in the Dragon's Lair \"memorise the events and twitch respond\" direction than I prefer. There are a lot of corridors here and often only 1 or 2 ways to get through them. The way it handles death along with the pixel art occasionally makes it hard to tell exactly what you did wrong. I would have liked to see the option for a slow motion replay. How exactly did I pull those enemies from the second floor that time? A lot of the later levels increase the difficulty by just making the level longer, so a mistake on the 26th enemy means death and resetting to the beginning. I would have preferred if difficulty increased in some other way, since it often got tedious to redo the first 2/3rd of a level 20+ times.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I mostly enjoyed the game.

Music is phenomenal, story is great, game play is satisfying and fluid. 15 euros is a fair price and I just recommend you play.\n\nThis masterpiece easily one of my favorite indie games of all time. Everything about it is amazing. The only issue is that it doesn't go on forever. The combat is really satisfying and getting the achievements for this game was fun as well. \n\nThe game is structured around that fact that you die in one shot. The enemies however die in one shot too. What that means is that you have to weave around bullets and dodge incoming attacks with just your sword. The rolling, time slowing down and throwing mechanics work very well. On normal mode the game can be played reactively with you just parrying and dodging everything that comes at you.

And low n' behold as soon as I wanted it the developer, who I believe goes by the name, Justin? Was giving out steam keys on April 1st!\nI was lucky enough to snag one. Its safe to say I LOVE this game!!! From its characters, music, atmosphere, and gameplay to its writing and extra content like speedrun mode.\n\n Everything about this game to me is nothing but a perfectly fun game, I recommend this to ANYONE who's looking to play a short yet exhilarating game. Especially if you're a fan of games like Hotline Miami or movies like John Wick. Ever wanted to play a John Wick video game? Katana Zero's gotchya covered.

Sure, you can slap bullet time or save points into your game without explanation, but making them part of the narrative can provide unparalleled immersion for even the most outlandish titles. That\u2019s what makes games like Katana ZERO such rare joys, the fact that every single element of the presentation is tied to the narrative and mechanics. From your time-bending powers all the way to the VCR you select stages on, this intense, bloody journey builds layers of meaning and intrigue around a single, compelling core: getting through this neo-noir hell with as much style as possible.\n\nIn the rain-slicked streets of a grim neon city you arrive, clad in but a bathrobe and armed with only cold Japanese steel. The voice on the other end of your phone wants you to kill everyone in the strange factory you find yourself at, a simple task once you start slowing down time to the point where you can deflect bullets with a sword. Room by room you expunge all life almost effortlessly, painting the walls with blood from an impossibly quick blade. When your task is done you return to your hovel of an apartment, your nightmares, your appointment with that voice on the phone, your neighbors, your demons, your rivals, your doubts, your fears, and the truth.\n\nTo say anything more would be to spoil one of the most intense and twisting narratives you\u2019re ever going to get from a platformer, one that I\u2019m going to be mulling over for days if not weeks. Your hobo samurai has a lot of people interested in his mysterious combat prowess, while at the same time you get to play through vignettes of his life as an attempted citizen. There\u2019s often more drama in these little glimpses of city life than in the machinations of war and government he\u2019s caught in, thanks to some excellent writing and world-building. Just the way factions from the war are mentioned, or districts of the city, or famous figures is enough to make the setting pop in a way that few games can.\n\nMore than this, though, is how the brilliant dialog system puts you right in the center of the story. It\u2019s one of those where your responses are on a timer, and you must make your dialog choice before time runs out. However, most choices also give you a tiny window at the start where you can interrupt the person speaking. Interruptions can lead to wildly different paths through the dialog, and sometimes affect gameplay beyond that. And it\u2019s all done in lavishly colored animated text that floats over the speakers, highlighting key terms for emphasis and shattering on interruptions. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen everything Katana ZERO does with this mechanic, I assure you it will find a way to surprise you.\n\nThat\u2019s really the beauty of this one across all its features, that it will never stop surprising you. Every mechanic and detail will eventually get used in a way you didn\u2019t see coming, and that happens most frequently in the action itself. As a godlike samurai assassin, you have only your sword and your reflexes to dispatch goons, swordsmen, armed security, and worse. But you can slow down time to perfect your moves, roll past deadly attacks, reflect bullets with your blade, and sling objects like bottles and vases to neutralize distant threats. Each room must be perfected before you can move on, like little bite-sized Hotline Miami levels strung together in a mounting crescendo of murder.\n\nBut here again, Katana ZERO excels in the details. The action you are partaking in, the ritual of attempting, dying, and attempting again, is framed as the planning that your bathrobed terror does before actually executing. Once you have perfected your plan, the game replays the room for you as if on a security tape so you can witness your exploits at human speed. This is a key framing mechanic, and one that the plot centers on in a big way. And even this will defy your expectations in incredible ways, ways that make the game all the more engrossing as you battle your way through it.\n\nI cannot stress enough how polished every aspect of this title is, either. The pixel art is absolutely lush in its animations and special effects, making you feel ever strike of the blade and hitch of the video tape playback. The sound design matches the intensity of the action, and the soundtrack is some absolutely killer synthwave and soulful tracks that carry the neo-noir stylings to new heights. There are moments of levity, like the cosplay dialog options and Strong Terry, and moments of intense dread. There are beautiful vistas, and rooms caked in gore. It\u2019s an incredible ride from start to finish, and I assure you that you\u2019ll be left wanting more at the end of your 4-hour (or so) journey. Katana ZERO has a vision and it stops at nothing to express it, blending style, substance, and action into one of the most cohesive packages I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

I won't focus on reviewing just the game, but rather focus on the area that does not get talked about enough, which is speedrunning the game (the reason why I have half a thousand hours in the game). The game is exceptionally good at speedrunning, it's both easy to pick up and extremely satisfying to continue striving for even better times. Why ? It's because the gameplay is both satisfying and hard, and it only gets more punishing as you incorporate even more challenging ways of completing each room. A few more reasons why it's great to speedrun:\n- Barely any RNG present when speedrunning (besides the motorcycle section, but the dev promised that he will make this section RNG-less once the DLC comes out) and the RNG that is present only accounts for a few seconds of time variation, so that basically only matters at top level. As such the player's skill is the only thing that matters if you beat your personal best time or not.\n- The run itself is mostly gameplay, there are no cutscenes that you have to sit through and waste your time (there are like 3 instances total of the player needing to wait ~10 seconds in the entirety of the run).\n- Most rooms are challenging to speedrun, and each one have ways of improving time. There aren't many situations where once you learn the particular room it stops being challenging or it's impossible to shave off further time (exception being the final boss and autoscroller in doom, but a doom skip has been found for one of the autoscroller parts, so that's epic)\n- The runs are short, at top level they only take 15 minutes to complete, this means that you do not have to focus for extended periods of time.\n- The game is very easy to setup for speedrunning, you don't need to setup an external program to keep track of time, since there is an in-game timer.\n- The dev actually listens to our requests and will change some stuff once the DLC comes out.\n- The speedrunning scene is active, so pop into the speedrunning discord server and ask your questions.\nSo if you're interested in speedrunning the game, check out the guides section of the game's speedrun.com page. If you have never speedran a game before, give it a try, this was my first game that I speedran and it's a blast, give yourself a challenge first of obtaining a gold medal (~30 min range speedrun), and if you found it to be fun, aim for a sub-20 min run next.", "timestamp_created": 1638122500, "timestamp_updated": 1640370030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 298, "votes_funny": 159, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928985774517059326", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51457982": {"recommendationid": "51457982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294810959", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1680569779}, "language": "english", "review": "I pirated the game and played it from start to finish, and then bought the game. that's how good the game is.", "timestamp_created": 1561525661, "timestamp_updated": 1561525661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 483, "votes_funny": 221, "weighted_vote_score": "0.924896359443664551", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82453831": {"recommendationid": "82453831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996681866", "num_games_owned": 732, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1594294371}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Katana ZERO[/b] is a highly immersive cyberpunk/neo-noir (I honestly don\u2019t know the difference) cross between Ninja Gaiden and Hotline Miami. Albeit incomplete and short, this game oozes high quality production from start to finish; my only hope is that the continuation/future updates will manage to maintain this level of quality. I also want to mention that this genre of games usually doesn\u2019t interest me, so this experience was a very pleasant surprise. \nA big thank you to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dworry]dworry[/url] for recommending this game! \n\n[u][b]Played with PlayStation 4 controller[/b][/u]\n\n[h1]\u2714\ufe0f[u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[b][+] Attention to detail in combination with creative and intelligent design choices makes Katana ZERO an incredibly immersive experience:[/b]\n[olist]\n[*][b]We need to talk about how extraordinary the dialogue is.[/b]\nYes, the writing is good, but the way that dialogue was presented is what really blew me away. The developers used a myriad of animations to incorporate \u201cvoice acting\u201d in the text boxes without the use of voices at all. By changing things such as the speed of text appearing, and animations and colour of certain words or phrases, you get a very strong indication of the tone of dialogue. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163734569 \nFurthermore, you are offered dynamic dialogue options that change during the countdown. You can choose to take your time to select your most appropriate answer, or quickly and rudely interrupt whoever is speaking (emphasized by the shattering of the text box). Naturally, your answers/actions have an impact on the direct conversation and the course of the story. Katana ZERO may not be the first to incorporate these designs but they managed to execute it masterfully. \n\n[*][b]Superb attention to detail.[/b] \nThere are multiple examples of this but I will focus on the details that I found really added to the immersion:\n\n(a) Random entertaining NPC encounters that juxtapose the gore and other mature themes that run rampant throughout the game. [i]You can also pet a cat.[/i]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163733927\n\n(b) Mundane actions such as burning your kill contract or drinking your tea at the end of a mission have to be triggered by the player. It may seem silly but the simple act of interacting with a tea cup actually transmitted through the screen and helped me relax after the high-intensity segments. \n\n(c) At the start of the action sequences, Zero (main character) takes a moment to put on earphones and turn on his music cassette, which in turn cues the in-game music. As an added bonus, the music is [u]amazing[/u]. \n[/olist]\n\n[b][+] Easy to learn, hard to master type gameplay with the right amount of difficulty.[/b]\nIn short, you can move like a ninja and are equipped with the ability to slow down time, dodge roll, slash your sword and throw certain objects. The time-manipulation is certainly overpowered but is not indefinite (used up like stamina) and is counterbalanced by the fact that Zero has no health bar; every mistake is fatal and will cause you to reset the room. Each level requires a balance between good reflexes, wit, tactics and adaptability. Optional unlockable swords aside, you do not obtain any new abilities during the game but instead get better at managing your time-manipulation ability to deal with increasingly complex situations. While this is usually not my preferred type of game, the progressive difficulty made for a very enjoyable, yet challenging, experience. \n\n[h1]\u2796[u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[b][-] Compelling but incomplete story.[/b] \nKatana ZERO does a great job at balancing high intensity encounters with appropriate down-time moments and still manages to organically merge in hints of the backstory. However, the story is currently incomplete and has left me with more questions than answers.\n\n[b][-] Given all the buzzing and fizzing effects, this game is indubitably the worst nightmare for people with photosensitive epilepsy.[/b] \nIt\u2019s clear that the developers are aware of this, since they included a warning directly upon launching the game and also the option to turn it off. Since I do not suffer from epilepsy, I chose to experience the game as intended by the developers but found that it was a little too buzz-y and fizz-y for my taste.\n\n[b][-] Each room has a countdown timer to encourage a high pace but there were very few instances where I felt pressured to finish the level.[/b] \nPerhaps the developers were too generous with the time given? This may not be the case for hard mode but I don\u2019t know from personal experience.\n\n[h1]\u274c[u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[b][x] Short.[/b] \nMy first blind playthrough took approximately ~3 hours, and then an additional ~2.5 hours to explore alternative paths and endings. Upon finishing the game, hard and speed run modes are made available but I am more interested in experiencing the rest of the story. As far as I know, the developers have promised more content, so (hopefully) there will be more to look forward to!\n \n[h1]\ud83c\udfc5[u]Verdict:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 A fantastic start[/h1]\nKatana ZERO is currently an incomplete experience but shows a lot of potential. Despite thoroughly enjoying the game in its current state, I am slightly hesitant to recommend it at this moment. However, at the same time, the game shows enough promise to justify my faith that the rest of the game will be just as good (or even better?). The satisfying gameplay and immersive story form an excellent base to what might be an exceptional gaming experience.

This cult classic has slowly become my favourite game of all time. The side-scrolling slasher has been reinvented as an amalgamation of Hotline Miami and Classic Ninja Gaiden.  \nTelling compelling narratives in video games is no easy feat. Taking a heavily story-focused approach to design typically either results in more of an interactive movie or, in trying to balance both, nails storytelling at the expense of a top-quality gameplay experience. Every now and then, though, a game manages to nail the formula in a way that never feels intrusive or unnecessary. Katana ZERO is one of those games.\n\nKatana ZERO is incredibly secretive with its premise, and for good reason. The player takes on the role of a young man who\u2019s seemingly an assassin for hire. He takes assignments during the day and returns to his rundown apartment building in a less than desirable part of town at night. Every day he visits his psychiatrist to talk through his experiences and get a dose of a mysterious drug that allows him to manipulate time (something that has pivotal story and combat implications). The prologue is simple and gets you familiar with the combat system. It starts off as your formuala one hit kill which makes you want to play smart. It quite steadily evolves into more with the addition of the Chronos mechanic. Though it starts out fairly straightforward, the story takes several turns quickly. The writing here is sharp, and the narrative runs the gauntlet of emotions from thrilling to comforting to horrifying all in the game\u2019s short five to seven-hour runtime. I dare not spoil even a bit of the deeper narrative here, but Katana ZERO\u2019s unique dialogue system forces players to make quick decisions that directly impact how the game plays out, making it worth playing through multiple times in to try other routes. The story takes many incredible turns which will certainly confuse you (so try and pay close attention to all the dialogue.) There's very subtle but satisfying instances of foreshadowing to spot which only adds to this game's amazing replayability. With a recent update, speedrun and hard-mode have been added to compensate with the lack of content which offers a lot more to challenge yourself. \n\nQuite on the other end of the scale is the absolutely stellar sound design and 80s synth-pop soundtrack. The ringing sound in your ears every time you get a new dose of \u201cmedicine\u201d never stops feeling unnerving, and even the measured use of silence is done to great effect. There\u2019s a great mix of energetic and sombre tracks, and I came to grow rather fond of the quaint piano keys that played during the more mellow scenes. Also worth noting is that the names of songs and composers appear at the start of each mission shown on-screen as the samurai switches the track on his walkman.\n\nKatana ZERO is a concise, mysterious and rather sombre game. The way it tells its intimate story is engaging as some of the best thrillers out there, though whether or not the story itself lives up to the delivery is debatable. Nonetheless, this is an action game first and foremost, and to that end, it passes with flying colours. Expect to die and get frustrated a lot, but also look forward to a deep sense of satisfaction after banging your head against a particularly tough boss or enemy sequence. There\u2019s a lot of fun to have here and, with the choices you make having a significant impact on how the narrative plays out, it pays to run through the game a second time and try other options.\n\nIf gameplay, audio, visuals, and story were ammo loaded into a gun, Katana ZERO is firing consecutively from each barrel. With every component supporting each other, the title feels very consistent and well rounded. Any flaws like difficulty or varying times of knockdown recovery can be overlooked in my opinion. \n\nMasterpiece, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1569058417, "timestamp_updated": 1571964752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 151, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87907487154006958", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78878352": {"recommendationid": "78878352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074260101", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 543, "last_played": 1600365607}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, that should work", "timestamp_created": 1604752605, "timestamp_updated": 1604752605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 240, "votes_funny": 91, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877373278141021729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50208664": {"recommendationid": "50208664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018400193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1680372894}, "language": "english", "review": "Play it.

The whole game is presented as a neo-noir full of neon decorations action platformer with a captivating story full of twists and turnabouts. [/h1]  \n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n+ Satisfying gameplay with fast combat and lots of planning\n+ A captivating story that is easy to follow\n+ Protagonists' unique abilities \n+ Perfect level design\n+ Outstanding pixel art\n+ Synthwave/retrowave soundtrack \n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- The game is exactly filled with redundant swearings and dirty talks\n- The whole game is frustratingly short \n\nJust imagine that you found a game, which is a perfect mix of one your favorite genres in gaming, it's filled with your type of music and its plot reminds you of all these mindblowing movies you were crazy about all the time. That's exactly what happened to me while I was playing Katana Zero.\n\nKatana Zero combines everything that you need to have in a game, that would be called \"a true masterpiece\" when it' released. It's like picking perfect ingredients to make a delicious meal. But what's more important is that aftertaste that you feel after the meal. \n\nThat's what Katana Zero manages to do in the best way.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe story is probably the strongest part of the game and it's something I don't want to talk much about, simply because it's so unique and mindblowing, that you have to experience it all for yourself without any spoilers. The whole story had been strongly influenced by the best representatives of the cyberpunk genre and I am pretty much sure, that every single player will see this story in their own way.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe whole game is represented as a typical \"one shot-one kill\" game. You play as a veteran of a war, dressed in a kimono, a samurai which name, the whole story, and identity remain as a secret until the end of the game. The game's mechanics follow pretty much the same idea: you come to the therapist/psychologist, he asks you a few questions about your health, gives you a mysterious drug and sends you on the next mission. After your mission is done, you come back to your apartment, watch a vivid dream and then repeat. \n\nOne of the first game mechanics you meet in the game is the dialog options system. The player always a choice either interrupt interlocutor with a nervous response or listen to the end to have more answer options. Usually, this interruption thing leads to unpleasant consequences, while if you remain patient, you have a chance to retrieve some new information regarding the story and the game's protagonist. \n\nWhen it comes to combat, the protagonist has the ability to plan his attacks and rewind time whenever he fails. Once you proceed with the story, the game explains everything regarding this ability and how it all works. Since it's a one shot-one kill prepare to die a lot and plan as much as possible during your game. The difficulty's curve of this game can be a little bit weird: you start the game and it looks pretty easy, then few levels later it becomes way more difficult, then it becomes easy again and then everything changes once again. \n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that the whole combat thing is pretty fast, the player can dash, reflect enemies\u2019 bullets, roll between the enemies, make jump walls to get to his destination point, etc. This fast-paced action always keeps you strained never giving a little chance to relax. Most of the enemies can be killed by a single hit, some of the enemies can deflect at least one hit, so they require two hits to be killed but the most annoying enemies are the ones with shields, because they force you to jump over them and outsmart them, which can be a difficult task sometimes. \n\nThe majority of side scrolled levels can be completed pretty quickly and easily without any attempts or retries. Every single level is divided into small stages and if the players get a bullet in his head, they have to start over from that particular stage, not the whole level. What I really enjoyed in Katana ZERO is that most of the levels can be completed in multiple ways and the player always has a choice. It can be very helpful and quite convenient if the player is stuck at a certain point and the best way is to try something else.\n\nAll my love goes to developers for making the game equally interesting in terms of gameplay and its story. The more you play, the more you get into the story and feel like you don\u2019t want this game to end. They were able to find a perfect balance between the gameplay mechanics, level design, some unique levels that are different from the regular one, where you have to kill everyone and then just run away, pretty interesting and remarkable boss battles, etc. At some point, you understand that you feel a weird satisfaction dashing through enemies and quickly roaming around the levels to fulfill your contract.\n\nWhat I really didn\u2019t appreciate about this game is an incredible amount of swearings and bad words all along. I never felt like it was something required for the whole game or the story itself, this game would be even better without it in my opinion, seriously it was way too much at some point. \n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nKatana ZERO has pixel art graphics that may look pretty simple from the first glance, but once you play the game for some time, you will see that every single level, enemy and every other thing in the game is quite detailed despite its simplified style. Plus all these visual tricks with neon lights, VHS old tapes, and CCTV recording screens add some amazing charm to this game as well.\n\n[h1] Sound [/h1]\n\nAs being a huge fan of retrowave/synthwave music myself, I instantly fell in love with Katana ZERO soundtrack. The whole game is filled with Ludowic and Bill Kiley\u2019s tracks which perfectly suit the atmosphere of the game. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nKatana ZERO is a great pick for someone who is in love with action fast-paced challenging games and once you are into it, you will enjoy the game to the very end. It can be a bit annoying from time to time with its frustrating levels and a ridiculous amount of enemies, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are dealing with a great and quality indie title.\n\n[h1] Enjoy!

Its pulsating neon aesthetic, synth-heavy soundtrack, and hyper-violent gameplay are all familiar trappings of countless flashy titles populating the indie games space. Most are lackluster attempts to recreate the magic of 2012\u2019s Hotline Miami, failing to build upon the groundwork laid by one of the most successful aesthetically similar titles. Katana ZERO\u2019s dedication to presenting highly stylized and polished gameplay topped with a thought-provoking psychological storyline is what makes it a standout title of 2019.\n\n Katana ZERO is a neo-noir action adventure title that puts you in the robes of a mysterious samurai hitman. Tasked with eliminating targets residing within the confines of the dilapidated metropolis by a mysterious employer, the player searches for targets as well as answers to their equally mysterious past.\n\nKatana ZERO\u2019s gameplay concept is fairly straightforward, however the level of mechanical polish and style makes it remarkable. Levels, such as prisons and underground science facilities, are broken down into various rooms. Each room is filled with patrolling enemies that must be eliminated before being allowed to proceed. Combat is instant death, which adds considerable weight upon every action taken. Careful planning is required before proceeding, which places even greater emphasis on a required gameplay mechanic: death. Death triggers the rewind feature which, upon dying, shows the player a replay of their last life. This feature allows for analysis of mistakes or an opportunity to study environments to discover alternate routes or strategies to employ. In a game where death comes in a split second, this tool is imperative to mastering the fundamentals of combat.\n\nWhile death is frequent, most encounters (boss battles aside) should only require a handful of lives before being able to surpass them. Combat is challenging due to its ever-evolving nature which forces the player to be dynamic in their problem-solving. Fortunately, the player is given the freedom to pursue creative solutions to combat, as they are never pigeonholed in a single solution. While brute forcing their way through fights is rarely viable, it always remains an option if your skills are up to the task.\n\nAs you are a samurai, a katana is the primary means of dispatching enemies, but you also momentarily have the handy ability to slow down time. This makes evading enemy attacks simpler and ideal for perfectly deflecting incoming projectiles back at their senders. The feeling of lethal speed of your character is both satisfying and gives combat a fluency that\u2019s intoxicating. There are also single use projectiles such as bottles, knives, and Molotov cocktails scattered throughout environments that serve as deadly commodities best reserved for tricky combat situations. All of these abilities are essential in exploiting the weaknesses of more advanced enemies, such as shield-wielding cops or katana-parrying thugs.\n\nHad Katana ZERO merely been a fantastic stealth action game devoid of a meaningful story, it would still be an easy recommendation. So it also offering an expertly penned psychological neo-noir story not only elevates but compliments the entire experience. The player\u2019s plight to uncover their traumatic past is one that begins simply enough yet quickly presents many more intriguing questions. Snippets of backstory are uncovered during therapy sessions or visits to your dilapidated apartment in-between missions. While at the time these snippets of information may be confusing, all the puzzle pieces fit into place by the end. It isn\u2019t merely rediscovering the past, but interpreting the present. The narrative frequently challenges the player\u2019s understanding of their realities, with the concept of an unreliable narrator being called into question in more ways than one.\n\nThe player does have some impact on how their story plays out through the dialogue tree. Frequently faced with dialogue options during conversation, selecting one of three options results in varying conversation paths, and will affect the outcome of some sequences.[spoiler]In one mission, a hotel receptionist questioned my samurai outfit. Instead of ignoring her, I opted to give a lengthy lie about cosplaying as an obscure anime character. At the time, this was a humorous interaction and nothing more. It wasn\u2019t until I was leaving the hotel, covered in my recently slain target\u2019s blood, that a police officer questioned my appearance. Just as I expected a fight to break out, the receptionist interjected explaining that I was a cosplayer and not a crazed killer. The officer bought this and allowed me to leave the lobby peacefully.[/spoiler] Moments like this make the dialogue option more than a simple extension of the narrative, as the player\u2019s decisions can have a meaningful impact on their progression.\n\nThrough the entire experience, Katana ZERO exudes a familiar but pleasing aesthetic and noir tone. It\u2019s a gritty, yet illuminated neon city filled with unsavory characters who are a reflection of the run-down metropolis. Its environments are simple in their construction, but the minor details that populate the world give it life. Whether it\u2019s your character switching on their walkman, blasting synth heavy 80s techno before every mission, or removing his katana before sitting down, the developer\u2019s dedication to bringing this world to life is fiercely apparent.\n\nMy only complaint is that there isn\u2019t more of it. It only takes about four hours to complete, but I am already planning to return to it to discover alternate dialogue options and to bask in its terrific gameplay. It\u2019s a game that, from the outside, skeptics could dismiss as \u201cjust another neon pixelated action game,\u201d which the indie space certainly has an abundance of. But Katana ZERO\u2019s almost unprecedented level of polish, lightning-fast gameplay, and thought-provoking story make it one of the year\u2019s best indie games.", "timestamp_created": 1566362767, "timestamp_updated": 1566362825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853057026863098145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115316326": {"recommendationid": "115316326", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225113179", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 614, "last_played": 1652624127}, "language": "english", "review": "man katana zero is so cool i wish drugs were real", "timestamp_created": 1652302244, "timestamp_updated": 1652302244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 39, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851496398448944092", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97798018": {"recommendationid": "97798018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016047015", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1625786361}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Yes, that should work.

You play as a damaged war hero with a weak grasp on time and reality who performs assassinations for his therapist. It really does feel like a mix between Hotline Miami and Gunpoint: taking the fast pace, high stakes gameplay style from the former, and the level design from the latter. I was really surprised by how much story there is here, I was even more surprised by the fact that it\u2019s actually the most compelling part of the game. \n\nNote: At the time of writing this, I have seen one possible ending for the game. I will continue to update my review as I continue to play, but it\u2019s worth noting that this is a short game. I\u2019ve read on the forums that it\u2019s expected to take 4-5 hours to beat, which lines up with my own experience so far.\n\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\n[list][*]The art here is fantastic. I\u2019m obviously a sucker for cyberpunk, but the pixel art here is really top-notch stuff. The animations are also great.\n\n[*]As I mentioned, this is a pretty story-heavy game. Absolutely not what I expected, but it works surprisingly well. The game is well written, and the story is really intriguing. Everything is confusing to begin with and information is revealed to you as you play through the game. \n\n[*]The gameplay is tight and can be incredibly fast paced. There have been time where I\u2019ve just kind of flailed around and hoped for the best, but for the most part it remains pretty precise. You blow through levels slicing up enemies as you careen towards an assassination target. You can also slow time and throw projectiles at enemies. Apart from some boss fights, everything here goes down with one hit. \n\n[*]Every time you die, you get rewound to the start of the section you\u2019re in. The game feels fair, so whenever I died, I was only frustrated with myself, which is what you really need from a game like this. Figuring out the right way to approach things, or just improve your skills, and then beating a section you found hard is very satisfying. \n\n[*]The levels are really well designed, and there\u2019s definitely a noticeable increase in difficulty as you play through. There\u2019s not a huge amount of enemy variation here, so the challenge comes from where enemies are positioned in levels, and what other kind of obstacles there are. It works well.\n\n[*]There\u2019s an in-universe explanation for why you\u2019re able to \u2018die\u2019 and retry the levels. It\u2019s not super convincing, but I appreciated this detail, nonetheless.\n\n[*]The music is fantastic. [/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral: [/h1]\n[list][*]There are a bunch of secret achievements here, the majority of which seem to be related to things that are easily missed while playing. If you\u2019re an achievement hunter, there\u2019s probably some enjoyment to be had in replaying levels to search for things, but if you\u2019re not then I don\u2019t think Katana Zero offers much replay value. [/list]\n\n[h1]Negative: [/h1]\n[list][*]Katana Zero\u2019s biggest problem is that the gameplay doesn\u2019t evolve, at all. You have a sword, you can grab things to throw, and you can slow time [spoiler](later in the game, you do play as a character who has an extra ability, but it\u2019s still not enough)[/spoiler]. All of the game\u2019s mechanics are given to you in the first mission and then that\u2019s it. Like I\u2019ve said, the gameplay is really good, but I was disappointed that nothing new was introduced across the different missions.\n\n[*]Enemy variety isn\u2019t great. There are two melee enemies, two ranged enemies, and then one that is a kind of combination of the two. Now, these enemies are well designed and there\u2019s definitely good variation between them, but five enemy types for the whole game didn\u2019t really feel like enough to me. Combine this with the lack of any gameplay evolution, and the variety in the game really takes a hit. The level design is the only thing that keeps the game fresh.\n\n[*]As I mentioned up at the top, there are at least two endings for the game. There\u2019s a crossroads kind of moment where you make a choice and you either end the game there or continue playing on. I am now continuing on, but I first chose the other option. I found that ending incredibly lacklustre and really disappointing. This moment in the game is made out to be a really big deal, and if you don\u2019t choose to carry on then it kind of just ends and there\u2019s no resolution to the story, and I felt like there should have been. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\n\nKatana Zero has some major issues, but that hasn\u2019t stopped me from thoroughly enjoying it. Tight gameplay and an engaging story, what\u2019s not to like? If you\u2019re a big fan of Hotline Miami-likes or games with similar level design to Gunpoint and Deadbolt, I\u2019d recommend giving it a try. But it\u2019s probably best to wait for a sale.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1555700174, "timestamp_updated": 1555700174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845951437950134277", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117532484": {"recommendationid": "117532484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203982844", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1656097478}, "language": "english", "review": "Hotline Miami on cocaine with samurai sword", "timestamp_created": 1656097669, "timestamp_updated": 1656097669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845366060733795166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88319258": {"recommendationid": "88319258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080354701", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 581, "last_played": 1633811306}, "language": "english", "review": "A friend recently bought me this after I told him I bought Ghostrunner and he claimed it was much better for half the price and a fraction of the download time.

can describe Katana Zero is that it gives you the same feeling that you get when you're a kid and you are leaving the theater after watching an action movie. It plays super well, has incredibly tight controls, and makes you feel like a badass vicariously when you do things correctly. It's an incredible game for speedrunning (it even has a speedrunning mode built into the base game), and also offers a really interesting story that will leave you wanting more at the end of the game. My only regret is that I wish it was longer in base content, just be cause, once again, not only is it incredibly fun, but it just feels *so good* to play.

I enjoyed the game very much and I'd love to see what happens next.\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\nPixel art that is well animated and engaging. Distopia future style. Extremely violent. Blood can be turned off. There plenty of the 80's Cyberpunk style.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nStory brings in a lot of questions and mystery to every single character. I'd say more but I feel this story needs to be experienced in the way it should be: Through dialogue text boxes. There is a timer on every piece of text and choices to be made within the time. Going through the story once, I can't tell you if choices change the outcome of things. It's engaging to choose a different response on multiple playthroughs.\n\nEdit: As I played a little more trying to get achievements, I learned that some answers give you different results in dialogue and give a little more depth to the conversation. Ultimately, your choices in dialogue doesn't change the main outcomes of game endings. Typically, games have a set ending no matter what you choose, simply because there is a narrative to follow or that making multiple endings is much harder to get done.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nTwo people created the music and they did an excellent job giving the thrill and motivation to keep going. Mostly retro synthwave with good dance beats.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe controls seem a little, how should I say, fast but slow at the same time. It's tough to explain, but they are responsive. It's like each thing you do has a small cooldown period.\n\nSlash\nJump\nDodge Roll\nSloMo\nThrow Object\n\nYou are thrown into a 2D cross-section of stages with baddies to kill before you can move on. If you die, you have to do the entire room again. The game is super fast paced, even with the slomo gauge.\nYou are able beat the game without slomo, but this is extremely tough, and should only be done in Speedrun Mode where the enemy spawns are not random. Yes, that's right. In Story Mode, enemies can spawn little off, turned around, moving in a different direction. This can be frustrating to those who want to get past a difficult section by learning a pattern. It can give a sort of fun challenge where it's not the same thing over and over. Things change up, so it doesn't get stale.\nMy advice is to beat the sections purely based on light planning and reaction time.\nYou can deflect bullets!\n\nAs you progress, new enemy types spring up, but interspersed with the old ones you have seen. Some have much faster reaction times than before. Careful with the muscle guys, their fist swing has a hitbox bigger than expected.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nExpect to die many times. I'd say the game is not too tough, but not for the faint of heart. The game presents you with small sections where it doesn't feel like a unending gauntlet. You do need to think quickly and be on your toes.\nDeaths are quick and can even be quicker when the rewind feature is turned off.\nI did not get frustrated at this game's difficulty (Normal).\n\n[h1][b]I did not like being shot by enemies off screen.[/b][/h1]\nBut you can kill people off screen too.\n\n\n[h1]Stuff[/h1]\nThe game starts you out with a small tutorial to teach you the basics of movement.\n\nThere are secrets, easter eggs, and other fun stuff to enjoy as you go through the story. The game is extremely interesting and wanting to have fun everywhere you go. The devs really put in a lot of thought into the games design. Take your time when there is down time.\n\n[h1]Small details[/h1]\nStory Mode - has a slight randomness to enemy location, facing, movement with each respawn from death.\nSpeedrun Mode - Unlocked after beating the game, with a bunch of nice settings for speedrunners, like removing the randomness if you don't die.\nHard Mode - Unlocked after beating the game.\n\nController support for ALL major platforms - PS, Xbox, Switch, K&M, with icons and labels in their respective setup!\nMy only tip would be to turn down the camera shake. I turned mine down to 5%. It was too much at max.\n\nI sort of wished there was no timer for dialogue, but at the same time the game urges you to just keep moving with your instincts.\nIt was really fun to be able to NOT use SloMo and get past certain sections. Makes you feel super awesome not to need to slow things down.\n\nSpeaking of speed, take a look at the Hitpause option. This is an option where each hit done pauses the action for a fraction of second for dramatic effect. This also gives time for players to take a look around for bullets, but this can slow down and eat inputs. Turn this option down and the game will seem to go even faster and react quicker to your inputs.\n\nA lot of the changes in options makes it feel like you're playing a whole new game.\n\nI created a small guide on the extras that you hunt down.
