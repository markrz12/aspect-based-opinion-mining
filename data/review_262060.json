Not only do you have to deal with the physical dangers but also the stress and horrors of these dungeons.\nThis is what makes this game so unique. Normally in most games you take a health potion and heal your character but here you need to manage their stress as well. And that is not easy.\n\nPros\n- Amazing setting (atmospheric).\n- Probably the best narration in a game.\n- Very nice 2D art and music.\n- Lots of heroes giving you plenty of options for team dynamics.\n- Endless replayablity with multiple difficulties and classes and the random nature of dungeons.\n\nCons\n- Very Difficult (You will need a few guides to get the hang of things).\n- Very Difficult (You will lose heroes frequently).\n- Very Difficult (RNG will ruin your deathless runs regularly).\n- Very Difficult (Just when you think everything is going well one room in a dungeon will mess things up).\n\nThis is a game I keep coming back to regularly. Easily in my list of the greatest games ever made. This game is for those who get satisfaction from overcoming a difficult and challenging game. Has no respect for your time. Permadeath means you could lose a levelled up hero after dozens of hours upgrading their gear and stats. But as they say you wouldn't appreciate happiness if you didn't experience sorrow.\nDid I mention the game is very difficult ?\n\nHere is a tutorial I made for New Players to get started(Hope it

At the very beginning, as soon as you boot up the game, it tells you that Darkest Dungeon is all about making the best of a bad situation, and I'm sure anyone who's put any amount of time into the game, can confirm that this is definitely the case.\n\nEffectively, the game plays as thus; A week passes every mission, there are multiple 'Dungeons' you can go to, each with their own trials and tribulations, enemy types and bosses, you take a party of four that will suit that dungeon and complete the given task. After that task is completed (or failed) party members will level up and you'll earn gold and trinkets, which you use to upgrade your Hamlet (Effectively your base of operations) in order to become stronger to make dungeoning easier and get access to harder quests.\n\nThere are a multitude of heroes/classes to choose from, each of them bringing their own unique abilities and playstyle to the game. You can also rename all of your heroes to anything you want, making the game ideal for those who want to put their friends in the game (This is what I do for all games that I can, such as XCOM or Phoenix Point or Disgaea) or also ideal for Twitch Streamers as you can make your chat feel more involved by naming them after people in there.\n\nThe gameplay loop is very satisfying and I don't ever get bored playing this game, although what I will say is, things -will- go wrong. You will lose that max level hero to something out of your control, yes you can debate that the game is mostly RNG, but think of the game more like D&D as opposed to other turn based RPG's, it's the dice that does decide at the end of the day. However you do have a multitude of ways of mitigating damage and making sure you're getting the most out of your heroes, if you plan ahead well, know when to take a loss as well (tactically) you'll be fine.\n\nThe game is long, there's no doubt about that, you're talking anywhere between 30-50 hours for one proper run at the game, beating the final boss and all.\n\nAnother great aspect about the game is the Hamlet, randomly you'll get Town Events, these can be positive or negative. Things such as... The Tavern is free for the week, or a free weapon upgrade (This can be particularly helpful in the mid-game when money is an issue.) Or negative ones such as a big bad boss is at your doorstep all of a sudden, with no preparation and you -need- to deal with him. It makes the game feel alive, like not everything is always 100% under your control, and this, for me, is what makes the game so exhilarating. \n\nIn truth, I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, I guess I've been done over by RNG a few times but upon reflection, I guess I could've prepared better, but sometimes I did just get crit 3 times in a row and had a hero die, but I also don't see how blaming RNG for losing someone is a bad thing, especially when that's the nature of the game; you expect this going into it. But that's the reality of the game, I'd say it's a feature and not a flaw, you can do all the preparation in the world and be set up perfectly, but as the narrator so aptly puts it, as you think you're doing well. \"How quickly the tide turns.\"\n\nTo me, this is one of the best games ever made, it offers extensive replay-ability and despite its unforgiving nature, it's extremely rewarding, I promise when you pull off something magnificent, or one of your heroes becomes Virtuous, or you beat a boss that was skelping you endlessly, you'll be jumping out of your seat in joy.\n\n10/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672731269, "timestamp_updated": 1672731269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790435969829559326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134711904": {"recommendationid": "134711904", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027129554", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3853, "last_played": 1694789112}, "language": "english", "review": "Mmm... plague doctors.\n\nHuh?

Is it too hard? Honestly I'm not sure. I don't think the dungeons are too hard. Very luck based sure, you die a lot sure, that's common in the rougelite genre and I don't think that part is that much worse than any other.\n\nThe problem is that Darkest Dungeon is not a rougelike. Or even a rougelite. It's an RPG. It REQUIRES you to grind and level characters. The only thing rougelike-ish about it is that the dungeons layouts are randomized, and permadeath. RPGs also have sequential dungeons, random encounters, and randomized loot drops. If it weren't for permadeath, it would play exactly like a turn-based JRPG.\n\nThere is no skill based way to complete a higher level dungeon in DD without leveling characters in low level dungeons. And unlike actual rougelikes, it punishes you for losing. They took \"punishing\" much too literally. In fact, they seem to have spent a lot of time thinking of creative and complex ways to punish the player. It literally requires you to just wait for your characters to heal and recover from the permanent damage they take while fighting. I don't mind dying, but I HATE waiting. There is no reason for this gameplay choice other than maybe sadism? You should never include both grinding to level characters along with permadeath. Avoiding grinding is one of the central reasons to play rougelikes over traditional RPGs, and that's the thing they decided to bring back. You can't manage the hard dungeons if your whole party of four isn't high level, so losing even one character requires you to go back and grind a new one if you don't have a replacement.\n\n\nMost rougelikes suck me in. I die a hundred times, and every time I die I think \"THIS time I can do it!\" Even in rougelites with a lot of metaprogression, once I unlock a level, I always have a decent shot at beating it when I launch the game. In Darkest Dungeon, when even one of my characters dies, I think \"time to give up and play slay the sprite on max ascension for six hours and die over and over\"\n\nIn order to start having fun with DD after losing all my characters to bad RNG, I need to grind the first two dungeons for several hours to stand a chance at the higher level dungeons I managed to unlock. And the early dungeons aren't actually hard! So I'm actually NOT being challenged 70% of the time I'm playing, because I get punished for losing when I do face a challenge, and the punishment is grinding. Imagine deciding to punish your player for losing to challenges by making them play the easy part of the game for a hundred hours.\n\n\nThe bummer is that every other part of the game is awesome. The combat is awesome, the lore is awesome, the dungeons are awesome, the artstyle is awesome, music is awesome. But I don't want to play it. Sometimes I think about giving it another try, and I always get bored and feel like I wasted my time. I think that for me, the one change of figuring out a way to remove the grinding would turn it from a 4/10 to a 9/10.

Developers and fans tend to claim people who dislike the game is because they cannot take a loss. That is simply untrue, and draws away from improving what could be a top tier game. Two major game phases can be distinguished when addressing the game's difficulty:\n\n1) Green-orange mission stage = First ~15 hours of playtime (depending on the player's skill). They are fantastic. The game is hard, but so is fair. You certainly lose characters, but action-repercusion is balanced, and even as punishing as they are you can still learn from your mistakes. The game shows you that every unnecessary risk or poorly planned run can have huge repercussions. But since the game is fair you can beat it with improving. The experience is rewarding, and a huge sense of accomplishment is born with each improvement in your skills. This is the game at its best.\n\n2) Red missions - darkest dungeon stage = late and end game. This is where the problem and all the controvesy come from. The dungeons become a chore to play through, and definitely not worth the trouble. The game enters full beat-down, fuck you mode. Action-repercusion is no longer balanced, you feel a huge disconnection between your actions and what is happening. Enemies are everywhere and their stats are dialed up to 11, because reasons, hard means good right? Enemies damage, health and specially dodge skyrockets. And most importantly, critical chance for their attacks rise up to >20%. The biggest implication of this is that cleaves (area attacks), which already were unlike those from the player in which you sacrifice damage to spread it (and enemy simply deals equally large amounts of damage to everyone), become devastating. And trust me, a ~1/4 crit chance of dealing a quarter total health damage to your squad + illness or bleeding is A LOT. This is the reason of all the RNG complaints, mainly due to the dodge and crit stats; you can play a perfect run, but the huge dodge and critical chance from the enemies will most likely fuck you up regardless of your skill. This is not a difficulty you can overcome by improving like in most other roguelikes: the game is unfair.\n\nThis poorly designed difficulty leads to the game's biggest flaw: it disrespects the time of the player.

The gimmick of the game is that you cannot prepare for everything (unless inordinate quirk locking be considered a virtue), the trinkets always have some kind of downside (or kind of useless when they don't), but the good thing is that having stuns, lots of damage, speed, accuracy, some healing and some stress healing and camp skills to heal stress makes the game a lot more managable, so the conclusion is that you want to look out for heroes that have the aforementioned things and don't interfere with each other's positioning and always can do something useful in case you get surprised or shuffled. Another factor is more related to your personal blunders like forgetting some provisions like Blood or shovels and what not, or starting a fight you can't finish (Shambler, Collector) or having to abandon the mission because your team comp couldn't get to the boss room with little damage, or letting a hero get an affliction (this usually causes a domino effect and you'll probably abandon the quest soon).\nOnce you harness the game mechanics and RNG to some extent, the game becomes really enjoyable.

I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a roguelike, but it has permadeath once one of your heroes dies in combat is gone [spoiler] most likely [/spoiler] forever, this makes the game incredibly punishing.

The game makes an incredible emphasis on the positioning of your heroes some abilities are only available in specific rows so keeping the position of your heroes and messing up the enemies position it\u2019s a key part of the gameplay. \nThis game highly rewards knowledge and using the right tool for each situation.

Not today[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n[b]Darkest Dungeon (DD)[/b] is a unique game, as I never played a game as punishing as this one. With the sequel recently being released, my interest was piqued to try out the first game that I happened to already own but never spent much time playing, and I'm glad that I took the opportunity to check out this gothic-themed experience.\n\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Interesting gothic based story\n[*]Fun but brutal gameplay that is very punishing\n[*]Upgrades for your heroes, town, and more\n[*]Beautiful 2D gothic art style\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Playing this game can be a chore at times due to the needed grind\n[*]There are times when you will be reliant on RNG and it might screw you over\n[*]Activating some of the DLCs on your first playthrough is not recommended\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story starts out with a man known as the [b]Ancestor[/b]; he learns of this special power that is somewhere deep in his mansion. He then uses up his family\u2019s remaining fortune to hire people to help him dig up this mysterious power. However, it turns out that this power was something worldly and he ran from the dungeon. Only the [b]ancestry[/b] survived and he wrote a letter to the next heir of the family, to fix the mistake he made. After he sealed the letter and before the angry mob of villagers that were mad for what he did could get him, the [b]Ancestor[/b] had ended his life.\n\nThe story for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is not fully told to you directly, rather, it\u2019s told to you at different points in the game, mainly before you do boss missions. It\u2019s interesting at the very least and I like the gothic [b]Cthulhu mythos[/b] theme it has going for it. Although [b]DD[/b] takes inspiration from the [b]Lovecraftian[/b] universe, there are also different inspirations that are included as well. The heroes you hire also have back stories to them as well.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay for [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is fun but also very challenging and at the same time, it can be very difficult to grasp. There are many mechanics that you yourself have to try and get used to. You will be able to hire different heroes that each have different abilities for them to use. Each of them also may have a different mechanic that corresponds to them, however, they all do share the stress feature. Stress in the game is determined by what the hero goes through in a given situation. When stress reaches 100, that hero will have a certain negative Affliction inflicted on them, like them being fearful, paranoid, etc. \n\nHowever, there is a chance that some heroes will be given a virtue when they reach 100 stress, they get increased stats and will randomly heal themselves. So, while most heroes get afflictions and break, others will use their stressful moments as something to encourage themselves. If a hero gets to 200 stress, they will lose the virtue and go back to zero stress, while those with afflictions suffer a heart attack.\n\nDuring combat, your heroes can do certain attacks or abilities to buff/debuff allies or enemies. Each hero has a certain amount of health and it does vary, when their health runs out they will be put under a [b]Death\u2019s Door[/b] status. When they are in this state, they will suffer state penalties and they have to go through a test to see if they will survive the next attack. I should note that if your hero is at 1 health and the enemies attack them with a move that does a lot of damage, they will tank the entire attack except the one damage. The only way for a hero to die is by failing the [b]Death\u2019s Door[/b] test.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283070\nIf a hero suffers a heart attack while at [b]Death\u2019s Door[/b], they will be killed immediately, when a hero dies, they are lost for good and will also lose the equipped charms they have. You can recover them if you lose a hero in battle but if it\u2019s outside of one, they are gone completely. So pray that your best heroes survive the attacks and that their stress does not get too high.\n\nThere are ways to relieve stress, like taking out enemies or using a camping ability at a campsite. If your heroes survive the mission, you sent them on, you can send them to a few stress-reducing activities like making them meditate, drink at the bar, gamble, pray, etc. There are also times when a hero will get a disease, so you must take them to the [b]Sanitarium[/b] for them to get cured. A hero can get a max of three diseases, if they happen to get another one, it will just replace one of the current diseases they have. Last I checked diseases don\u2019t necessarily work like that but who knows, I am not a medical expert.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995282569\nI should at least give a little tip/warning that if any hero happens to get stunned, for them to recover it will take that hero's turn. Enemies get the same treatment as well. In other words, [b]Red Hook Studios[/b] took some inspiration from the original [b]Persona 3[/b] game and wanted to bring back memories.\n\nCertain moves will also only be available for you to use if that hero is in a certain spot in the party. If they happened to get moved or pushed back, they will be unable to use certain attacks or support abilities. It\u2019s understandable for some attacks but for others it\u2019s absolutely stupid - like, the [b]Vestal[/b] can\u2019t use her [b]Divine Grace[/b] or [b]Divine Comfort[/b] abilities, which heal party members, if she is in the front. I understand that she is a support hero but it\u2019s still pretty dumb that she can\u2019t use those abilities if she happens to be pushed into the front.\n\nNow as much as [b]DD[/b] is fun, there are a few issues with the game that don\u2019t hinder the experience but can be a turn-off for some people. Playing [b]DD[/b] can be a chore sometimes, you will have to do a lot of grinding depending on the difficulty that you choose. This is normal for an [b]RPG[/b] like this game but it can get very repetitive for some people. To add to the fact is that the game also relies on RNG for almost everything that happens in it. Trust me, when your hero misses an attack you will feel pain.\n\nSome of the DLCs in the game are also not recommended to be activated on your very first playthrough. Ones like the [b]Butcher\u2019s Circus[/b] (which is online PvP) or the [b]Musketeer[/b] are fine because they just add features that don\u2019t hinder the experience for the player. However, DLCs like the [b]Crimson Court[/b] add stuff like more grind, a very annoying status debuff, and is just punishing to new players. Buy the DLC on your first playthrough if you just want an even more painful experience.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Performance[/h1]\nThe art style for [b]DD[/b] is absolutely beautiful, I love the gothic-based art style that the game has going for it, and is very detailed. I experienced no issues while I was playing the game.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2995283203\nI tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. \n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nThere is a lot that I haven\u2019t talked about with [b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] as there are numerous things to uncover from the game. If you are someone who wants to play a very punishing game, then this is the right one for you and you will get your money\u2019s worth because a playthrough could go up to at least 50+ hours.\n\n[quote] Women and men' soldiers and outlaws; fools and corpses.

I've played it quite a few hours, which by itself might seem thumbs-up recommendation, but it really isn't.\n\nI like the battle line style games (by which I mean the array/position of your characters in a turn-based combat has meaning).  A front line, a back line, support, damage, looking for synergies.  Nifty. Engaging even.\nI've read/watched the guides and tips.  I didn't find any of it particularly of use, I've been playing these sorts of things for a while.\n\nThe reality of this game is... frustrating.  At anything higher than the easiest level, the RNG is cruel and punitive.  At the easiest level... some mild challenge (which ramped up _sharply_ for the final dungeon).  The designers should note there is a significant difference between challenging and just mean.  Not to mention a nuisance factor.  \nI'm okay with taking losses if it achieves my goals.  Slogging to earn enough money to make the characters viable so they can complete the only challenges available, watching them get crushed, oft with a series of crits from the enemies and misses on my part, in the first one or two meaningless fights in a run?  When there are likely to be 5 or 6 more fights plus maybe a boss?  Ugh.  The challenge is high enough that losing even one of four characters on the way to the boss is a death sentence (in the boss fight, that's fine, I've lost 3/4 and still won, dicey though).  \nHealing, especially stress healing, is sparse enough, and defenses low enough that one might think that the all damage is the way to go, but attrition will quickly show the error of that thinking.  And, ofc, the decent support classes mostly don't do enough damage &/or tank enough to make them viable on their own (as it should be, but there is a balance to be achieved in there somewhere).\n\nOh, and the money grind.  Painful, right up until you are flooded with it.  But did I mention the building upgrade resource grind?  Which is dependent on the RNG?  And your limited space, competing with money at every turn?  Choices matter and all that, but you truly need _everything_, right now, no exceptions, or you die trying.  Repeatedly.  Over and over.  Which might be okay... IF the losses at times didn't leave you so destitute as to be unable to continue at all.\nNot workable.\n\nAnd after now rage-quitting from yet another excruciating and drawn-out series of failures and TPWs (which is the usual way I go in this game, build, build, nurse the characters and teams, try to scrape by, then watch it all collapse like a house of cards), the game is uninstalled.", "timestamp_created": 1690348731, "timestamp_updated": 1690348731, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600524723529815674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133138813": {"recommendationid": "133138813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043356212", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 7800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7800, "last_played": 1676766277}, "language": "english", "review": "TL&DR: At this point, Im pretty sure more people have heard quotes from the narrator, than have played the game.\n\nStory: 7\nGraphics/Art Style: 8\nSound/Voice Acting: 10\nControls: 7\nPerformance: 9\nCombat: 8\n\nStory: 7\n- Theres just enough there to get you into the game and keep you interested.\n\nGraphics/Art Style: 8\n- Very unique art style with just enough animation to keep things interesting.\n\nSound/Voice Acting: 10\n- Some of the absolute best voice acting (Narration) youll ever hear in a game!\n\nControls: 7\n- The controls are very basic with some minor annoyances.\n\nPerformance: 9\n- Even with all the mods; I only had a few borked start ups.\n\nCombat: 8\n- Its very straight forward and copied many times over now but the interesting part about it is how much it punishes you.\n\n--Final Thoughts: Darkest Dungeon does its best to make everything difficult and a pain in the ass.

Eventually, I decided to give the game a second chance because I wanted to at least beat it. I did a bit better and got a bit further, but honestly, after a while, the game started to feel like a bit of a chore. I felt like progress was slow and I was grinding a lot after a while. It seemed a bit repetitive and eventually I just felt like it wasn't worth it anymore. I couldn't force myself to get to the end because I just wasn't enjoying myself. I felt like I was just focused on farming trinkets/gold and leveling up the characters for most of the time I was playing rather than actually advancing. Occasionally, I would beat a small boss but that was about it. You really have to be in it for the long haul if you want to be a completionist.\n\nThat being said, I think there's a lot of good in this game. Most of the characters/elements are pretty balanced for the most part, and there is some fun strategic stuff here too. If you like this genre, it might be worth a try especially on sale.

So many decisions seem designed to amplify the oppressing feeling of the setting through gameplay. \n\n- Inventory is a huge hassle. There's an intentionally designed tension between carrying enough supplies with you to have what you need and having enough room to carry back treasure. This should be interesting, but in practice it means that you just skip many curios when you don't have the appropriate item because it's not worth subjecting yourself to the whims of RNG. You also constantly have to just throw money and resources on the ground and move on because you can't carry them. The game is balanced around this of course, but it's intentionally balanced to make you feel bad while you drop loot. \n\n- The \"easiest\" difficulty setting sets you up for failure. Playing on Radiant, the recommended difficulty for first-time players, causes you to level up faster, among some other small bonuses. This leads to inevitably overleveling your characters for the level 1 and level 3 dungeon runs, and being hit HARD when you try to take them into level 5 runs without max gear and skills (that you haven't had time to afford before your characters got to max level.) This can easily lead to your first deaths after an easy run, and a slow, boring grind to get everyone up to speed so you can actually move on. \n\n- Speaking of grinding, good god. There is a single class that is used for making extra money, so good luck not bringing this extremely underpowered character on every run (it can be made to work well, mostly by literally hiding behind stronger characters.) There is a constant, demanding drain on money that increases every week. For every run where you bring back 20k, there's 2 negative traits and 1 disease that need to be purged. By then, your big payday is 2 upgrades on one of your 20 heroes. Better get back out there immediately!\n\n- RNG is part of just about every aspect of the game. Attacks are dodged frequently, crits are hugely impactful, and whether or not your characters live or die when their health reaches 0 is a dice roll. The game is balanced around this all averaging out, so usually things work out, but the outliers are frustrating and not based on player skill at all. An example from my experience: Party has one healer, this character is hit with an attack that can cause a bleed DoT. The attack crits, one-shotting the healer down to 0 HP (but not killing her, that's a dice roll.) The attack applies a bleed DoT that will tick on her next turn. If another party member can heal her past the amount of 1 tick of the DoT, she is not subject to the death's door dice roll, but there are no other healers so she has to pass the roll and heal herself. Her turn comes up, she fails the roll and is dead with zero input from the player. That this RNG averages out to being balanced over a thousand runs is no consolation for this feeling terrible and giving the player a bad experience. The game is still winnable, I can get another healer, but see all previous points for why recovering from a disaster isn't fun either. \n\nMaybe they fixed all this in the sequel lol, I won't be finding out.", "timestamp_created": 1684101872, "timestamp_updated": 1684101872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550074636936187744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132010719": {"recommendationid": "132010719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297011586", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 957, "last_played": 1661291067}, "language": "english", "review": "I may be salty, bad and everything alike to those emotions.. but in all seriousness;\n\nFork this game.

According to Steam, I have played 117 hours of DD. Around half of these were played more than a year ago when I rage-quit for good. Or I thought as much. I tried to check out the sequel which is still in early access just to see if the devs were fixing the issues I found obvious, but without luck. Anyway, this year, I returned to this game and tried once again to beat it but again smashed into a wall.\nAfter 30 years of gaming, I don't believe I have hate-played a game before, but Darkest Dungeon takes the crown for being a major disappointment. But before discussing what I believe are flaws in game design and presentation, I have to talk about its virtues: First of all, the art, music, narration and overall atmosphere are all amazingly good, -I would say iconic- and are in the end what make me come back to this game. The gameplay mechanics of stress, in addition to normal damage and the afflictions, quirks, torches, loot system, and virtue mechanics are all wonderful concepts and work well in the game. The settings, monsters and story are also very evocative and hint at an eerie Lovecraftian worldbuilding. The classes are ok, with some being totally uninteresting and bland and others some of the coolest in any game ever. \nBUT my main issue with the game is that in order to enjoy all that greatness you have to push through a random, grind-dependent, limiting and obscure way of playing, presenting the story, and (not) teaching the player how to ...play\nYeah ok I get it, the devs wanted to make the game HARD and want you to \"GIT GUD\" and not take you by the hand to show you how to win. I get all that. But for me that is not the way to do it. And even if you do \"GIT GUD\" in this game you just have a better chance of winning. \nIn Darkest Dungeon the getting good part mainly means two things: Grinding and becoming more familiar with the game itself. But the game never tells you how its own mechanics work. This is work you must do on your own, and I mean not in the game, but through googling and visiting wikis and watching other players play. You need to do that for example to understand what \"PROT\" means which is a stat in the game (it's basically ARMOR lol).\nIf you already know what works for one area of the game, you can stroll right through it. If you have fought the bosses once and you remember how you beat them before, and you know what each hero's stats and skills are, you can select the appropriate party for each boss and kill them easily. If you have grinded enough to upgrade all the necessary town buildings and all your heroes have good armor and weapons (which basically means having money and heirloom loot) the game is not that hard. BUT the game doesn't tell you that you don't need to upgrade some town buildings AT ALL while if you don't upgrade others you are F***D. This is why if one follows a guide from a veteran player and do the exact same things they do, they will most likely win (and it's the way most people have learnt to play the game successfully, through meta-gaming). \nBut that is the definition of boring. And call me old-fashioned but I think games should be fun.\nDarkest Dungeon doesn't help you build any skills as a player either, unless it's skills in accounting, bureaucracy and nomenclature (and don't tell me the skill is strategy because that is cancelled by the RNG half of the time). Don't get me wrong, there is quite a bit of fun in the randomness and tension of the encounters but after the first 30 hours the fun stops and the game becomes mainly a chore in order to get to the few next fun parts. An example of that is that it takes waaay too many runs, way too much money and way too many hours of your life to build a roster of heroes strong enough to attack the actual Darkest Dungeons. The stories are also kind of good but they are spread really thin throughout the game and none of the narratives actually have any serious impact, they act more as excuses to keep going through the same dungeons over and over again, fighting the same enemies over and over again, having to throw away too much loot you cannot fit in your tiny inventory and trying your luck with the game's supercharged RNG. \nThis game is a bit like playing backgammon with Lovecraft themed graphics and sounds where if you lose, you die and go to hell :D\nI have played 117 hours of this game and not once have I managed to get beyond the first Darkest Dungeon where all my level 6 heroes (which take around 30 hours of playing time to build) get wiped out.

Set in a dark and foreboding world, the game puts players in control of a team of adventurers who must navigate through a series of increasingly difficult and dangerous environments while battling a variety of supernatural monsters. The game's narrative is presented through a series of journal entries and cryptic messages that slowly reveal the game's backstory and lore.\n\nWhat sets Darkest Dungeon apart from other games in its genre is its emphasis on psychological stress and the toll that adventuring takes on the human psyche. As the player's characters explore the game's environments, they must contend not only with physical dangers but also with the emotional strain of facing constant danger and uncertainty.\n\nThe game is designed to be challenging, and players must carefully manage their team of adventurers in order to survive the game's many hazards. The stress mechanic is an integral part in this, as players must constantly monitor their characters' stress levels and make sure they are taking steps to reduce stress before it becomes too much to handle. Failure to do so can result in characters gaining negative personality traits or physical afflictions that can severely impact their effectiveness in battle. Additionally players must also carefully consider their team composition and equipment choices in order to succeed. Each character has their own unique abilities and strengths, and players must choose which characters to bring on each mission and how to equip them in order to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nRed Hook Studios showed courage by breaking away from the generic dungeon crawler formula that dominated the gaming industry then (and today) and instead created a masterpiece that stands the test of time.

These heroic badasses frequently swagger into labryinths, smash all the bad guys, steal all the loot, and when necessary, resurrect themselves with reckless abandon. But usually, these heroes are human beings. Humans can become frightened, they can have doubts, they can lose their minds and even betray their allies when their survival is threatened. They can succumb to post-traumatic stress after particularly harrowing experiences. These traits are at odds with the daring depictions of heroic characters, and so they are glossed over or sugarcoated. In Darkest Dungeon, they are an integral part of the game.\n\nBefore the events of the narrative, the player character's long-lost relative contacts them via letter, explaining that he has done something horribly wrong and paid for it dearly. He was a bored, jaded nobleman, and one day decided to investigate the rumors of an interdimensional portal underneath his castle. The rumors were true, and he unleashed a grotesque, terrifying horde of creatures on the surrounding countryside. The horrors were enough to drive him mad, and after summoning his estranged relative, he commits suicide.\n\nUpon arrival in the hamlet beneath the hills of the haunted family mansion, I was given a small group of adventurers and a bleak message from the game itself, informing me that bad things were going to happen. I collected my eager, fresh band of heroes and an assortment of provisions (no Xanax, unfortunately), and then descended into the darkness for glory and treasure. Well, that\u2019s what I hoped to find - more often I found derangement and despair. Every mission in Darkest Dungeon is randomly generated, with new rooms and hallways filled with curios, wealth, traps, and monsters. Whenever I reached a chest, corpse, or bookshelf to investigate, random effects would occur depending on my party\u2019s statistics and provisions. Sometimes we were awarded some gold, or a trap would spring and inflict a party member with a terrible disease. Most of these encounters are avoidable, but the fights are not.\n\nInstead of the tiles found in earlier roguelikes, Darkest Dungeon uses a two-dimensional presentation. During fights, my party of four was arranged to the left of the enemy party of 1-4, and opportunities are determined by the placement of a character within the formation. My arbalest-bearer, for instance, is better towards the back of the party, where she has enough room to shoot her crossbow. The healers like to be in the middle, and the paladins and shieldbearers belong up front. Party abilities can synergize with each other for tactical advantages - the jester can shuffle the party around and open up combo opportunities, while the bounty hunter can \"mark\" targets for big bonuses from other members. Of course, enemies can also do these things, and they have an AI capable of taking every possible advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the health of my heroes that I\u2019m concerned with. Some enemies, as well as the conditions of the dungeon, can inflict stress damage. Stress is a secondary form of damage that, if accumulated too quickly, will generate quirks, neurotic tendencies, and downright psychosis. My heroes would crack when the burden got too high and lose their nerve, suffering from masochism, selfishness, or other maladies, which can lead to lost turns and increased stress on their allies. One of my first paladins, Reynauld, is a degenerate kleptomaniac, prone to stealing treasure in the field and keeping it for himself. One of my healers has an obsession with sainthood and takes every opportunity to martyr herself. My favorite highwayman suffers from alcoholism, and so on and so forth. These afflictions, as well as the myriad diseases that can be contracted in these filthy environments, can all be cured at the local sanitarium - for a price. Stress can be reduced via religious devotion and nighttime revelry, but all of this is only possible for heroes who are actually able to survive the expedition, which is a tall order. Heroes who die are permanently lost, but green recruits arrive weekly in the village. Little did they know they would become just another resource to me, as expendable as the torches and rations that accompanied them on their forays.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a mixture of stylish comic-like characters and a dark, gothic environment. The fingerprints of Lovecraft and Poe can be seen everywhere, from the tentacled monsters of the cove to the iron bars of the asylum. The effects match the theme perfectly - during battles, fighters cut into the foreground when they attack, and their model switches to a horrified grimace when something bad happens, like losing their mind. Movement animations are simple, but the character models are very detailed in their 2D way.\n\nThe music was composed by Canadian musician Stuart Chatwood, who also worked on 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time'. It is heavy on the strings and Victorian flavor, and like the gameplay, is deep, dark, and depressing. The narrator (whose character is the dead former proprietor of the castle) is the only voice besides enemy barks, and his pained, guttural delivery is excellent.\n\nIt's thick roguelike influences means that Darkest Dungeon is the kind of game that thrives when it is played over and over. Every dungeon is procedurally generated, every chest has a chance at strange fortune, and every new character offers a different set of abilities. Even when times are tough (and they will be tough, I assure you) upgrades can be made to the village facilities that slowly improve the heroes\u2019 quality of life and chance at survival. In turn, the dungeons also get more challenging.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is the rare game that gets my heart pumping while playing, not because it\u2019s scary (even though it is a little scary), but because the stakes are so high. One battle can make the difference between waltzing out flush with loot, and returning home defeated, with the party dead or completely insane. It will punish your mistakes and it will even punish your good fortune, on the rare occasion it happens. Despite all of this, or perhaps because of it, I cannot seem to stop playing Darkest Dungeon.", "timestamp_created": 1686160024, "timestamp_updated": 1688936940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139513686": {"recommendationid": "139513686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108358149", "num_games_owned": 1003, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4216, "last_played": 1685844878}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] \"Remind Yourself That Overconfidence Is A Slow And Insidious Killer.\" [/h1]\nTried the game 3 years ago and gave up and ended up completing the main story on build 25721 a couple days ago with the large majority of the game being a great first experience into the roguelike genre.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nStorywise this game is average, while it is explained why you are in the town and what your goal is through the narrator and memoirs, it honestly felt forgettable; nothing really stuck to me. I could not figure out what caused the black magic in the first place or the change in intro towards boss dungeons without watching a video after I completed the game. Then again you are not really playing this game for the story, but for the roguelike dungeon experience. Voice acting, music and sounds are top-notch especially during lower torch levels. It actually made me feel anxious about progressing.\n\n[h2] Graphics/Level-Design/World [/h2]\nVisually the art style fits the game and is unique, everything from the abilities, character design and the dungeon itself looked great. Each of the zones looked unique and you could tell what zone you are in without a name just from enemies and the environment. The only design direction I did not like was how some characters like the Hellion have a large head proportional to her body, kind of making her look like a Chibi. Enemy wise, they matched their zone with their resistances being relevant such as more blight resistance in the warrens. The only issue I have with the enemies is how their stats are presented, I understand this is roguelike but nowhere in the game glossary or hover is it explained the effect of value of resistances. For instance I have been able to stun an enemy with 50 stun resistance but in the 60+ hours I\u2019ve played I have not stunned 100, 200 or 300 enemies yet for blight I have managed to get it to proc enemies with up to 150+. It\u2019s the same for acc on enemies. Why do I need to use the wiki to find out a swine ability hit rate is 82.5, it should just show me that in game. It is actually convoluted how none of this is explained in game.\n\n[h2]Bugs [/h2]\nPerformance wise the game runs great, it is not an inherently demanding game with the art style. So you should not have any issues running this game. Bug wise I did encounter stat bugs such as acc showing 0 when it should be showing a significantly high number. It does update correctly after an action but it's too late at that point. Aside from that I have not experienced any bugs.\n\n[h2]Conclusion [/h2]\nIf you want to try out a roguelike for the first time this game is a great entry into the genre, the game does a great job at encouraging persistence when your hero dies. But I do think as a new player a lot of things can be better explained and presented in-game.

Nearly 200 hours! You must really like Darkest Dungeon, right?\n\nWrong. Darkest dungeon is a roguelite with a fantastic start, and a woeful endgame. A wonderful idea twisted into a horrible, bloated mess - which I suppose is fitting given the theme.\n\nStandard opening: Who the hell am I? I'm the guy who;\n\n-Likes a good indie RPG.\n-Likes a new mechanic\n-Is a working adult with a full-time job\n-Is not a 100% completionist\n-Likes \"Lovecraftian\" a little more than \"Lovecraft\"\n-But okay, 'Mountains of Madness' wasn't bad\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a turn-based, dungeon crawl roguelike, set in a Lovecraftian world. You are tasked with recruiting various classes of hero into your roster, sending them out to fight the darkness. Over the course of the playthrough you will likely see many heroes fall, but with (an awful lot of) determination you will see you town and heroes grow, and push against the darkness.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is incredibly well-stylised, and works its limited graphics better than almost any game I have seen. The artwork itself is extremely limited and the animation barely existent but time has been taken to make the transitions and feel right. This is complemented by an iconic narrator whose tone and extent of contributions meant that I never grew tired of listening to them.\n\nSuch is the commitment to the Lovecraftian concept, that your party members have not only a health meter but a sanity meter. In practice this means little more than juggling two health bars, but thematically it works well. Darkest dungeon is unusual in that its bullshit-o-meter runs absolutely off the scale - one enemy crit cascade added fifteen hours to my playthrough. However it all seems to tie in to the theme well.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is enjoyable, challenging, well-written and generally well-presented indie RPG. I have no doubt whatsoever that you will enjoy it.\n\nThe start of it, at least.\n\nSee, Darkest Dungeon expresses some quite astonishing delusions of grandeur about its own lifespan. This is a game that you can happily sink 30 hours into, whose \"abridged\" campaign will take closer to 80, and whose unabridged campaign is probably closer to 150. It has no business being as long as it is. The four areas have two bosses each. For no reason other than length you fight these bosses three times each. And you grind and grind and grind.\n\nWhen eventually the bosses are done, the end-game doubles down on the pain with the sort of level design they should teach out of you on day 1 of design school. Overly long dungeons that, should a character die (at which point your run is to all intents and purposes over) you must kill another character to retreat. Two enemies critted my full-health Vestal back-to-back, and she died from the resulting bleed. I retreated and lost my tank. Lacking another appropriate healer and tank (because characters can only take end-game dungeons once?!) I had to grind up from level 2 a new party. WHY?!\n\nI have finally completed Darkest Dungeon and now can put it to bed. An exercise in how to outstay your welcome.

Even on the surface this doesn't make sense to me, as these heroes are harried by such terrible things in the dungeon that they develop permanent behavioral quirks from the traumas, yet they will declare that a certain aspect of their quest to restore their family home isn't difficult enough. I'm not the only one here not seeing something add up, right?\nApart from the nonsensical behavioral excuse, there are two distinct gameplay flaws that lead *directly* to this issue surfacing; poor pacing and burdensome roster management.\nDarkest Dungeon is perfectly comfortable to let you get to know your heroes and locations without any prior spurring, but this lack of urgency can lead to an imbalance in unit competency levels where some may flat out refuse to do a task suddenly, forcing you to either do a task with a less optimal team leading to extra unnecessary post-dungeon recovery time or flat out failure.\nThe only reason you are forced to use an 'incorrect' or inefficient party comp is because the game also heavily limits the amount of heroes you can keep on your roster, as well as randomly doling out any handful of heroes each time you return to the hamlet, leaving you absolutely no guarantee that you'll have the right party comp or even the right level when the task you like decides to show up on any given week's mission selection.\nUltimately, I would have to further dig myself into this game to even have the chance to fix my roster in this example alone, which might also lead to me finding myself in a duplicate of the same situation and an even deeper hole to climb out of.\nI know enough about game design not to fall into that trap. I feel like all of this could be avoided with the proper removal or reworking of the already shallow leveling system, but it's already so ingrained in the gameplay that I can't find a mod that wouldn't ultimately make the game easier without compromise.\nI really don't understand how something like this is either so poorly implemented or so poorly explained in a game that is so very clearly beloved.", "timestamp_created": 1666733379, "timestamp_updated": 1666733379, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540018200874328613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128965351": {"recommendationid": "128965351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297227956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2528, "last_played": 1673353218}, "language": "english", "review": "Agony, pure unrivaled agony. 10/10!", "timestamp_created": 1671628325, "timestamp_updated": 1671628325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53979790210723877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136413442": {"recommendationid": "136413442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024807750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1681870164}, "language": "english", "review": "It has a lot going for it, the art, the feel and it is not a bad game.

Character DLC helps to add more abilities for the player to use at their disposal, and that should be enough to help in the long term. Should you attempt to actually complete the entire game as I have.\n\nIf you have played a game similar to this before and dont want a challenge, refer to the first paragraph. \n\nIf you have played a game similar to this before and dont care/want a challenge (are a masochist like me), then buy the game, get the Color of Madness and Crimson Court DLC. This game will ramp up in difficulty and have ALOT of content for you to complete while feeling challenging and question how quickly you can adapt to a worst case scenario coming true. \n\nUltimately we will see if your efforts are worth it but, I am sure if you continue to try you will be rewarded with a moment of accomplishment before looking to the second game for more enjoyment~.\nPlease be

It's a goodish game. It has neat elements. Kinda a 2D extraction survival type game which I think is neat. But it lacked a certain depth that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It's simple to a flaw.\n\nOne of the main differences between this game and others is the Stress System. It's kind of a health metric. If your adventurers get too stressed out, bad things happen.\n\nI like that idea on paper, but the application leaves a lot to be desired. You end up having characters in desperate situations that refuse to receive the support they need to survive. That's part of the stress system. They can be so stressed out that they refuse any form of aid, including counselling (which will reduce their stress). So as the player, you're left to watch a situation devolve into a disaster with zero ability to effect the outcome.\n\nTaking control away from a player is rarely a recipe that results in a quality game mechanic.\n\nThe realisation that this game is not for me came after a stupid battle where everything that could go wrong did go wrong and I ended up suffering some loses. The specific losses were not irreplaceable, but the circumstances surrounding them were unacceptable to me, so despite my hatred to do so, I attempted a save scum mid mission to get a restart.\n\nUpon loading back into the game, I found myself mid mission with all casualties still dead. Already on the fence about whether I liked the game or not, that pushed me over the edge. That was the end of my time with Darkest Dungeon and my 50 hour play through. \n\nI play video games to have fun. Being challenged is part of that fun, but not all of it.

It simply does not matter how much knowledge of the game you have, what comps you have built in your party, or what trinkets you equip to increase your chances of your characters' survival. This game is purely RNG-based and your entire Stygian run can end because of a fraction of a percent chance that a particular enemy hits your most vulnerable character and causes a cascade of heart attacks, wiping your entire party and prompting a restart. And believe me, after nearly 300 hours invested in this game, that less than a fraction of a percent chance feels a LOT more than just that.

Economy/Base-Building Side is very satisfying.\n\nA game to recommend to someone for all of the wrong reasons.\n\nThis game should not be fun. It just shouldn't be.\n\nYou get punished for doing a good thing, you get punished for doing a bad thing, and occasionally, randomly, you get fucked because the game decided it's Fuck-O'Clock in the morning and you look ripe for the pickin'.\n\nSurprising an enemy sounds like a good idea, right? Well, not in this game. Because surprising an enemy doesn't net you an extra turn, rather just you all go first. So, if you can't kill all of them in one turn, the enemy now gets 2, 3, or 4 turns to fuck up your guys without any recourse.\n\nAnd let's not forget that the RNG is incredibly biased, or at the very least feels biased, towards the enemy. They will consistently crit and land low-chance hits while they dodge every attack aimed back at them. This compounds into the problem of surprising enemies actually not being a good thing, because enemies will line their ducks up, then proceed to double-crit a party member, promptly kill them, and all because you managed to surprise them, which is a random event in this game.\n\nMake no mistake, this game is very fun and satisfying when it wants to be. Landing hefty blows in the 30s and 40s of damage is incredibly satisfying when you've built a party or character for that purpose. But my god, this game is an even tug-of-war game at its fairest, and a suicide mission at its worst.\n\nAs far as the economy sides of things goes, collecting treasure and upgrading buildings and managing your party through the Hamlet, it actually feels fairly balanced.

To most, in the age of thousands upon thousands of titles to play, that might not seem like much, but trust me, it is.  Darkest Dungeon is a game that gets you to feel again.  You play, in hopes that you have set yourself up for victory, but know that there is always a chance in every step, turn, decision for things south.  When things do go wrong, it is often disheartening, but it is also a chance to really show your mental metal and pull things out of the proverbial fire - and even when that fails, Darkest Dungeon has that one extra layer of hope in the form a hero who becomes courageous when there is nothing left.  You get attached to your heroes, you grow sad when they die, you go to work mad on Monday when your party gets wiped because you just kept telling yourself \"They can make it...\"   Yes, Darkest Dungeon brings back something lost in games, it gets you to feel.   Mix all this with a solid system of abilities, stats, characters and a unique aesthetic of art and environment, and you have a true masterpiece of gaming to experience.

A perfect \"dark\" game to enjoy, a few clones emerged, which speaks for what's it worth. Two blood relatives arrive at what appears to be leftover ruins of their family heritage. Despite huge differences between them, your goal is to lead them to the very end. You command up to 4 mercenaries in turn based combat, that will search a couple of areas in search of family heirlooms, riches and plenty of fights, until they are strong enough to take on Darkest Dungeon. You will face several types of enemy families like undead, beasts, humans and abominations. Needs of your mercenaries and their sanity are also a factor. Maybe it's cheaper to kick them out once their end their usefulness? \n\nPros:\n+ Several classes / heroes (expanded with DLC and MODS)\n+ Each dungeon has \"unique\" enemies and represent different challenges\n+ At first appear unfair\n+ Narrator, music, style, feel, injury and despondence set the stage for heroism or cowardice\n+ Decision making. Do You take the loot, heirloom pieces or save your people?\n+ Lore\n+ Virtue system\n+ Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer\n+ Progression\n+ Bloodsuckers are cool\n\nCons:\n- Really bad RNG can kill even the mightiest hero\n- My Vestal had 59 bleeding at one point\n- Bad town management system\n- Sudden FPS drop when trying to hire crystal mercenaries (nothing big)\n- Can be devastating when You lose\n- Mercenaries with conditions refusing to be healed, help or self-skipping turns when on dead door is really irritating\n\nI really recommend to give it a try. Despite getting bored out after each 20 hours, I'll come back to this game. I could really experience the rainbow spectrum of emotions, I could only wish for better immersion perhaps? Will always remember how my Crusader when under mindcontrol, was self healing and stealing buffs from enemies rather than attacking friends.

I only play on Bloodmoon because I like that harsh challenging aspect of the game. So lets begin. \n     At heart it's a dungeon crawler. However, at no point did it really feel like a dungeon crawler. In the 275 hours I have played, it has yet to feel repetitive. It's almost like a paradox game, where after all this time investment I am still receiving knowledge checks and learning new mechanics and ways to play. There is always something different happening and the interactions constantly feel refreshing. \n     The customization is shallow, only being able to name the characters and choose from a few color palettes. Yet, I so easily feel myself becoming invested into my heroes. I enjoy naming characters after my friends who watch and names from fiction I like. Feeling genuinely driven to keep them alive and have them succeed. When they do well I often give them titles reflecting what it is they are doing well in. I named a Graverobber Lilith \"Demon\" because she would constantly drop massive crit roles and dodge like a machine. Which makes it all the more impactful when I lose these characters. \n     The progression isn't linear, and the game requires trial and error, more so reflecting an exponential curve in skill. The unspoiled surprises make the game exciting and intense. Leaving you on the edge of your seat wondering how you can adapt to the situation at hand. While on the flip side, being prepared and ready for engagements makes them all the more satisfying and enjoyable. The different areas, mobs, bosses, classes, and lore all are rather limited in the grand scheme of things. However, it is the presentation, execution, creativity, atmosphere, simplicity in design yet depth in lore and mechanics. That make this game truly a gem. \n     Once you are done with the base game, have had your fix and want something new. There is an entire workshop full of devoted fans who are looking to spice up the experience. I would name Pitch Black Dungeon particularly as something I look forward to playing. Which is a mod aimed at overhauling the entire game, and adding a completely fresh and re-balanced play through. People come up with some of the most interesting concepts for classes and characters. This game acts as an excellent medium for artistic expression in the facet of character design. Of course some art more... Niche... then others. There's something for everyone. \n     Within this unique small game there is an experience for everyone. At 25$ no less? The value is phenomenal. The narrator is a marvel in and of himself. I cannot stress how much I love this games art style. The three difficulties allow any and all players to find a desired experience. Usually difficulty sliders mean trouble for a games longevity (Total War I'm looking at you) due to the lack of proper balancing and creative limitations. However, this game actually found a way to make difficulty sliders add flavor and consistency. So whether casual (Radiant) or masochistic (Stygian/Bloodmoon), this game has you covered. I would absolutely call this a must play. There really isn't anything like it.

downloading the Darkest Dungeon 2 demo to see how much the sequel held up.\nOver the next 2 weeks I ended up spending 25 hours scouring the many locations, killing monsters and bosses, collecting treasures, and finally: beating the game. \n\n[b]OVERVIEW[/B]\n\nDarkest Dungeon describes itself as a game about making the most of a bad situation.\nYou send 4 heroes at a time to delve into one of the many different dungeons in the game, which holds monsters and treasures for you to collect.\nThe catch however, is that permadeath is constantly on, which means if you're not careful, or if you just get plain unlucky, your beloved houndmaster is dead.\nOn top of that, the game also auto saves, so no save states whatsoever.\nAll of this combined means that unless you are an experienced player, or look up a guide, you will very often have your nose to the grindstone during your playthrough.\n\nWith all of that being said, if you don't mind the possible death of some [i]debatably[/i] replaceable heroes, this is an extremely fun game for [b]ANYONE[/b] who likes turn-based combat, and exploration.\n\n[b]WHAT I LIKE[/b]\n\nI don't think I could fit every little thing that I enjoy about this game, so instead please accept this list of what I liked most.\n\n-The Bosses: The bosses for me were simultaneously some of the most fun, and most frustrating experiences I've had in Darkest Dungeon.\nOn one hand, coming in with a party composition that just so happens to be horrible for the selected boss of the region simply sucks.\nHowever the intoxicating feeling of putting enough DOTs on a boss so it's taking 20 damage on its own turn, or getting a lucky crit to prevent a character death is probably the best feeling I've had in this game\n\n-The Narration: This right here honestly might be what makes this game special to me.\nThe amount of work put into writing and voicing these line is incredible.\nThis might be the only game that routinely gives me goosebumps with how well done its voice acting is done.\n\n-The Characters: In the base game there are about 15 different characters to choose from.\nWhat makes each one of them interesting and unique to me is the written dialog for them.\nEach of the characters have different dialog they occasionally say depending on the situation, such as when they become stressed or hurt, or when they deal a critical hit.\n\n[b]WHAT I DISLIKE[/b] \n\nThe Speed: A decent portion of the game is spend wandering hallways in search of quest items, room fights, etc. but after a while, it just gets monotonous.\nNot only that, but at the last stage of the game I was going to the dungeons simply to level up some select characters for the last dungeon of the game.\nI just wanted to get it over with as fast as possible, so when I was leaning back in my chair with my mouse on my knee, listening to podcasts, I got pretty bored.\n\nRNG: As you would expect, random chance plays a big role in this game.\nIt can be the deciding factor whether you have an entire party wipe, as it's entirely possible that your healer drops down to a quarter of their HP, or that your party gets \"surprised\" which randomly shuffles their marching order.\nWhile it is certainly just a part of the game, and it probably gets evened out by the times you get a lucky crit heal, it still just feels really bad when your houndmaster drops to 0 due to a crit, and then bleeds out the very next turn.\nMind you, while I am speaking from experience here, that same houndmaster DID get revived by a random event, so again, it probably evens

The atmosphere when going through one of the Dungeons is great with a neat art style and sound design. There are many moments when it feels tense and you don\u2019t know if your heroes will survive the trip.Pushing forward with your party close to death and psychologically distressed to barely make it to the end is a great feeling.\n\nDarkest Dungeon has two main problems that decreased enjoyment for myself and looking at the reviews, it's the same for many others as well. Firstly the gameplay is just too repetitive. Most of the game is just going through randomly generated Dungeons that all feel the same with a handful of enemies. Having four different regions (and some more with DLC\u2019s) is good but they feel really similar to play. The other and perhaps bigger problem is how massive of an impact RNG has. Not only can you lose a hero without doing anything wrong, it will also take time leveling up a new one. But I also understand that randomness is part of the core gameplay design and the game would not work if it was just taken out. I just feel like the consequences are too significant for the amount of RNG involved.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind turn-based combat and are ready to push through some setbacks and beat a game that is against you, this isn\u2019t a bad choice.", "timestamp_created": 1676208075, "timestamp_updated": 1676208170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132516281": {"recommendationid": "132516281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020963219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3036, "last_played": 1690986061}, "language": "english", "review": "Great base game, great modding community.", "timestamp_created": 1676030838, "timestamp_updated": 1676030838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132385134": {"recommendationid": "132385134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295059593", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1166, "last_played": 1675990658}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly difficult game.\n\nHard to get into but trust me its very much worth putting in the effort to learn whats going on! \n\nGreat game easily a 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1675796745, "timestamp_updated": 1675796745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132345639": {"recommendationid": "132345639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022989400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3310, "last_played": 1675913825}, "language": "english", "review": "it hurt me", "timestamp_created": 1675730256, "timestamp_updated": 1675730256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132335807": {"recommendationid": "132335807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198892666349", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8599, "last_played": 1680110904}, "language": "english", "review": "Ruin has come to my mental state.", "timestamp_created": 1675714366, "timestamp_updated": 1675714366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132243919": {"recommendationid": "132243919", "author": {"steamid": "76561199194616988", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26450, "last_played": 1679961214}, "language": "english", "review": "The clock struck midnight, and the old mansion creaked in the wind.

Grinding. A Painful, yet inexorable journey to victory. But at what cost? \n\n[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]\n\nWell. Darkest Dungeon is definitely the right name for it. Two attempts, almost 4 years of real time, and many pick-ups and put-downs to actually finish it. Darkest dungeon will grind you down until you have nothing left. But you [i]will[/i] be back. \nTake on your role as the caretaker of this godforsaken hamlet, and the poor souls who dwell within. Seemingly the last of your line, it comes to you to cleanse this place. Hire waifs and strays, call them heroes, discard your humanity, and march these forsaken souls upon the bones of those that came before you. There is no other choice, there are no other paths. Only forward. To victory.\nUse the riches and the heirlooms that they uncover to improve the heroes lot, arm them with the trinkets found within the ruins, and return the town to its former glory, in the shadow of the forsaken mansion. Delve into that forsaken place once the survivors appear strong enough. Who knows, some of them might even make it out again. \n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Dark and broody in the right ways. \n[*] The duel physical and mental health mechanics are gruelling but interesting. They truly give the game an added depth, and the choice between how healed healed really is adds to that. The cost of recovery can be exorbitant, the cost of failure worse. \n[*] The narrator is just perfect. The music and sounds are also excellent. Even after the 100th time of hearing the same lines, they still land\u2026 It never even crossed my mind to turn him off.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Grindy as all hell. This is particularly bad if you happen to lose a hero, or more. Getting heroes up in levels takes time. Esp if they need recovery time after delves\u2026 which they almost certainly will. \n[*] Massively disproportionate losses and costs. You can mill through newcomers, however, to simply explore short missions with little to no equipment, fleeing once the burden becomes too much and taking what you have. \n[*] RNG hell. \u201cHow quickly the tide turns.\u201d Will haunt me forever more, after watching three group-wide crits in a row decimate my previously untouched party, followed by a round of tick damage kill every single one of them. I\u2019m sure every player of this game will recall a time their healer gave 1-0 points in critical moments, ending runs or even entire team\u2019s inches from victory. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] I\u2019d like the journal notes separated from loot, in order to make collection easier\u2026 OR they should impact other things, such as making certain boss fights easier, or unlocking characters.\n[*] It should be possible to \u2018press\u2019 higher level party members to undertake tasks \u2018beneath them\u2019. But at added stress cost, higher chances for their flaws to come through, and they take loot up to a certain value for themselves\u2026 This could also lead to additional perks and flaws. (Darkest Dungeon survivors should be willing to go on them for free\u2026 \u201cAnything to not be sent back to that hell hole\u201d. \n[*]Some saved layouts, or some way to see what I\u2019ve encounter in each of the areas would be nice. My memory is pretty bad and I ended up bringing everything to every mission, it was wasted space and gold, all because of my own imperfections. Just some way of seeing which items I\u2019d used in each space would have helped with this. \n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]\n\nDarkest Dungeon is not for the faint of heart. It is not for people who hate grind, it is not for people who grow super attached to their characters, and it is not for people who give up. It literally mixes some of the worst aspects of rougelikes with some of the worst aspects of traditional dungeon crawling adventures\u2026 but this is by design. \n\nDD is also [i]for[/i] all of those people. It will grind you down, you will put it down\u2026 but if you\u2019re not a quitter you\u2019ll be back, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not for another year\u2026 You\u2019ll suffer a loss, it\u2019ll be too much\u2026 but you will be back to try again, and there are always more bodies on the stage coach, ready to try their luck and make their fortunes.", "timestamp_created":

This is not a tale where all make it out alive. After the first cutscene, the game itself puts the truth before you in plain text; you are making the best out of a bad situation. Heroes will die, quests will have to be abandoned. This game will test you. You've seen some stating that this game's randomness can be unfair at times. But to be frank with you,\n\nThat's life.\n\nAnd so, just like how life is, this game can be brutal--almost to the point of you giving up. Or, possibly, like so many before you--to the point where you *do* give up. This game is a roller coaster of ups and downs, but if you push through, you can move past it. I feel that I should clear one more thing before the full review; this is not a game where sheer skill can guarantee anything. You can amass as much skill as you so please. You can bring in knowledge from every other game you have played and compare it to get an edge. But that alone will not make this game easy. You will inevitably struggle, you will inevitably lose. My advice to you; recognize where things are going bad, and get the heck out. Don't be a coward, running won't solve all of your problems, nor will it complete the game for you. But if you can judge where to push and when to regroup, take a breather, or just abandon the quest, you'll end up with fewer heroes graciously embracing Mr. Reaper. (Say hi to him for me, poor guy never gets a break.)\n\nNow, what am I missing? Oh, right, the review for the game itself.\n\n\n\nThis game is excellent. This game really is an opulent and imperial example of how smaller studio with an idea can make a game that better sticks to its theme than most modern AAA games. I'll give you a base rundown of how it works;\n\nYou send in a team of four complete paragons of virtue, each a cornerstone as to what humanity can be, what each and every one of us should strive fo-\n\nNo, no you won't be doing that. The people you are sending in are not the pinnacles of our kind. They are not perfect. What they are, is *human*. They will freak out if you push them too hard. They will doubt you if they think they'll get killed.\n\nAnyways, you send in a team of four, they stand in a formation one after the other. Each hero has skills that can only be used in set locations. The crusader can't reach the enemy if he's in the back, the highwayman can't fire his shots if he's right in the melee. You must organize your heroes accordingly. When you set off, you will take this party through the unknown corridors and rooms of this terrible place, you will encounter enemies, traps, and the flaws of humankind. You will realize that each hero has their own little quirks that cause them to act out, you will realize that they all require this little thing called food.\n\nThen, you'll have to contend with all the enemies in this desolate hellscape. The terrible creatures that stalk these lands and want nothing more than to slaughter your party where they stand. They will attack without mercy, there are no words to be said, there are no ploys to be played. When combat breaks out, there are but two things--blood and iron. A singular foe oft is no threat, but over time the quest will wear down on heroes. Enemies will get lucky, they will score occasional blows that can quickly bring a hero to their knees. Yet, in spite of that, the biggest threat to your team isn't them.\n\nIt's you.\n\nYour boldness, your depression that you've yet to develop, your overconfidence. It will come back to bite you. If for a moment you underestimate this game, it will take the opportunity to remind you exactly why you should not do that.\n\nGetting back to your noble crusade. Your ultimate goal is to purge the evil that your ancestor unleashed. His terrible doings unleashed all manor of fiend and foe, his actions wrought chaos into this land. A towering undead lord in the ruins, a drowning voice in the cove. All summoned by him. So what does that leave you to do? Destroy. Them. All. But in that regard, it is up to you how exactly you chose to manage your costs in this drawn-out war. Do you value the lives of those under your command? Or do you spend them like they're mere components in a business transaction? That, my friend, is up to you and your judgement. After all, there is exactly one thing in this game that is completely free; human lives.\n\nAs for your ancestor, he's the narrator. He has something to say on every occasion, his chilling voice is one you will be hearing for the entire game. And by the eldritch gods he's *perfect*... well, not as a moral human being, but as a narrator. His cynical tone befits the depressing atmosphere of the game. His remarks serve not merely as a reflection to his own personality, but to the reality of the world around you. Listen to him, and heed his words.\n\n\n\nOkay, this has gone on long enough. Before I go, I'd like to clear something up with you. I assume that this isn't the first review of this game you've read. If you're considering getting this game, you've likely seen the disparity between the positive and negative reviews. I'll be honest; this game may not be for everyone. It really is difficult, it really can screw you over. I laid out a bit of advice here, but sometimes it won't be enough. I acknowledge that, and there's nothing wrong with you if you don't want to play this game. But if you're even considering it, if you think that you can put up with it all and come out on top, go for it. Try your hand and prove that you are the flame that will free this land of your ancestor's wrongdoings.\n\nJust, remember one thing before you go;\n\nRemind yourself that overconfidence is a slow, and insidious killer.", "timestamp_created": 1665881757, "timestamp_updated": 1665881757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123836846": {"recommendationid": "123836846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015163636", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6811, "last_played": 1691590534}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1665784062, "timestamp_updated": 1665784062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123797380": {"recommendationid": "123797380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198444726224", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6762, "last_played": 1694815916}, "language": "english", "review": "prepare to suffer. that is all.", "timestamp_created": 1665715962, "timestamp_updated": 1665715962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123752157": {"recommendationid": "123752157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806420226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1677040498}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a dungeon, and it's dark", "timestamp_created": 1665628564, "timestamp_updated": 1665628564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123737995": {"recommendationid": "123737995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196743681", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1674748047}, "language": "english", "review": "An unfathomable and violent rage builds within me when I play but it's okay because I modded in anime women into my game", "timestamp_created": 1665601816, "timestamp_updated": 1665603071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123690956": {"recommendationid": "123690956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125817287", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1499, "last_played": 1665524426}, "language": "english", "review": "man I LOVE this game. many people say that this game is too hard. it is indeed sometimes but you just need to keep going and don't give up. you lost a good hero?

At times, it'll feel like the game doesn't make any sense, or like you're not making any progress.\n\nBecause Darkest Dungeon HATES you. It wants you to fail. It will punish every single mistake you make, and will refuse to praise your victories. As you progress, you will be micromanaging well over 20 characters - that's 5 full teams! - in order to get their stresses down, their bad quirks removed, their equipment somewhat passable, and their skills in optimal position for success. This is an absolute logistical nightmare, since to do any of these things, you need money - lots of it, which you can only get by going deeper into the dungeons. You will lose characters. You will lose progress. The real currency of Darkest Dungeon is not artifacts or gold, but the hard-learned lessons of every mistake you make along the way. You will learn your lesson, or your future expeditions will be just as doomed as the one that taught you.\n\nAnd I'm playing on EASY!\n\nBut it can be done. Stick with it. Make mistakes.

I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\"", "timestamp_created": 1678859225, "timestamp_updated": 1678859225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133613927": {"recommendationid": "133613927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181858269", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1725, "last_played": 1679246260}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing atmosphere, god-tier narration, immersive enough to satisfy most IMO.

None of the other reviews mention it....  First off, there's this overly-dramatic weird dude narrating everything you do.  Sometimes he'll catch himself being too zealous and try to save face, for example, sometimes after opening a chest he'll say, \"IMPRESSIVE HAUL!... if you... value... such things.....\"  Sometimes he's just psychotic - like if an enemy dies of poison he'll sometimes say, \"Slowly, gently... this is how a life is taken!\"  Sometimes the things he says don't make any logical sense - there's just a lot of alliteration, like, \"packs laden with loot are often low on supplies.\"  Basically really bad dad jokes, but with medieval vocabulary.  It's an incredibly unique sense of humor that I've never seen before.\n\nIt's not just the narrator either, it's everything.  The diseases the characters get while adventuring, like \"The Runs\" for example.  The personality traits they acquire, like \"The Witness\" - due to something they saw in church, they'll no longer pray for stress relief (it's a reference to child molestation by priests).  When their stress builds up to 100, they get an \"affliction\" which can have hilarious effects.  They could become \"Abusive\" for example and when this happens, they'll berate other members of their party which in turn stresses THEM out further, possibly causing a chain reaction with everyone getting afflictions.  They could become \"Paranoid\" and refuse to let other party members heal them.  They could become \"Masochistic\" and attack themselves.  You could then, after the dungeon run, put them in the asylum to treat their conditions.    You could pay to have their negative personality traits literally beaten out of them.  If it's not \"Dark Comedy\" I don't know what is.\n\nIt doesn't end there.  Even the characters' skills have funny flavor to them.  For example, The Graverobber has a camping skill called, \"Gallows Humor\" which when used, lowers her stress by 25 and all party members either get their stress lowered by 15 or get their stress RAISED by 15.  Get it?  She basically tells a sick joke while camping and there's a chance some people don't appreciate it and this stresses them out.  There's a bard-like character who plays a mandolin and his camping skills have names that all allude to real music... but it's all cheesy 80's tunes (Every Rose Has Its Thorns, Eye Of The Tiger, and If I Could Turn Back Time).  He's also got a skill called \"Mockery\" which raises one character's stress while lowering everyone else's stress (meaning that he makes a joke at someone's expense, which stresses them out and makes everyone else laugh).\n\nYou don't usually see such highly emotionally intelligent things coming from RPG devs.  Everything is translated into a number in these sorts of games - everything.  The college level psychology expertise couldn't be quite as funny in another genre of game - the irony of its presence in the nerdiest genre just adds that extra layer of comedy.  No offense to nerds, it's just that usually if you sharpen one corner of your mind, another softens.\n\nJust thought I'd add something that no one has talked about.  I think this is the 3rd funniest game I've ever played after Conker's Bad Fur Day and Trover Saves The Universe.  I didn't even think I'd like this game, the gameplay looked horrible and dated to me.  I just bought it b/c it was on sale and I've learned to trust critical consensus above my first impressions.  It's become a fav quickly though and no one should miss it.  I almost got my wife to try it and the only game she plays is The Sims.

Developed by Red Hook Studios, this masterpiece of gothic horror and strategic game-play demands your attention and rewards your perseverance in ways that few games ever manage.\n\nFrom the very moment you step foot into the grim hamlet surrounding the foreboding estate, you are immediately ensnared by the game's mesmerizing atmosphere. The haunting art style, replete with detailed character designs and eerie backdrops, works in harmony with the haunting musical score to create an atmosphere that is dripping with dread and unease. The feeling of being perpetually on the brink of catastrophe never dissipates, keeping you in a state of constant tension.\n\nHowever, it's not just the aesthetics that set \"Darkest Dungeon\" apart; it's the brilliantly designed game-play mechanics that truly shine. At its core, this is a game of calculated risk and resource management. Every expedition into the depths of the estate brings with it the potential for great reward, but also the very real possibility of utter devastation. The mechanics of stress, afflictions, and quirks serve as a stark reminder of the psychological toll that dungeon delving takes on your party, deepening the connection between player and character. The result is an experience that is both punishingly difficult and exhilaratingly satisfying.\n\nWhat truly sets \"Darkest Dungeon\" on a pedestal, however, is its unabashed commitment to challenging the player's decision-making skills. With the ever-looming threat of permadeath, each choice you make, from which heroes to recruit to which upgrades to prioritize, carries monumental weight. This unforgiving nature can be daunting, but it\u2019s also what gives the victories a sweet taste that few other games can replicate. Triumphing over a particularly harrowing encounter or defeating a menacing boss elicits a euphoria that's difficult to match.\n\nThe narrative elements in \"Darkest Dungeon\" are masterfully woven into the fabric of the game-play. The narrated passages by Wayne June add a layer of gravitas to the events unfolding, and the snippets of lore you uncover as you progress hint at a vast and terrifying world just beyond the scope of your torchlight. This world-building, coupled with the personal stories of your heroes, creates a sense of immersion that is profoundly engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Darkest Dungeon\" is not a game for the faint-hearted. It's a journey into the darkest recesses of human nature, a relentless test of strategy, and a tribute to the indomitable human spirit in the face of overwhelming odds. Red Hook Studios has crafted a timeless masterpiece that will undoubtedly be remembered for years to come. If you're seeking a gaming experience that challenges you on every level and leaves an indelible mark on your psyche, dare to venture into the abyss of Darkest Dungeon \u2013 your sanity may be tested, but your gaming library will be forever enriched.", "timestamp_created": 1693260483, "timestamp_updated": 1693260483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515923559665679932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133266670": {"recommendationid": "133266670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213195504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1609, "playtime_at_review": 18333, "last_played": 1696149119}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game ig", "timestamp_created": 1676942143, "timestamp_updated": 1676942143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515685439109802246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143990798": {"recommendationid": "143990798", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208597142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 561, "playtime_at_review": 3760, "last_played": 1695382488}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought it and it took me like 8 months to finally try it lol\n\nBut when i did, it took me by surprise how visually stunning this game is. The lore, music and gameplay dont fall behind too, as someone already said in another comment, the first message that shows when u play is that u have to make the most of adverse situations, and i can assure u that those situations appear a lot. But honestly, thats something that makes this game a lot better, the feeling that your decisions really matter, when u have to choose if u want to take the chance of getting amazing loot with the risk of getting ur party wiped out.\n\nI love the battle mechanics, the bosses look amazing and their battles encourage the player to learn their mechanics (stupid Wilbur lol) and think about the right party composition. Sometimes u get the enemies surprised and get a full wipe without getting any damage or sometimes u get ur party surprised and struggle to not get everyone dead or afflicted. The Stress mechanic sometimes is very hard to manage but it is possible, even in high difficulty dungeons, which btw are also amazing, every one of them with different types of enemies, which also have different types of mechanics and resistances that reward the player for building a good team for them.\n\nAnyways, the game is amazing, and im glad that i buyed, bcs i have a lot of fun playing

3857, "last_played": 1670580921}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall a good game,\n\n  However there are some serious issues with some game mechanics:\n1. Stress can be hard to manage at times, very little you can actually do to relieve stress. Then after you go to 100 stress normally you get a negative debuff that can cause even more stress or loss of control of your character. Would like to see more and better tools to manage stress in a strategic way. \n2. Too many negative debuffs. Even on trinkets there is almost always some debuff or negative effect on it.\n3. RNG heavily skewed to negative outcomes, both on loot, curios and fights. Very imbalanced and just unfair. One example I see a lot is when you send an aoe attack and all 4 monsters dodge it, very peculiar since they each have their own dodge rating. You would think that maybe some would get hit and the other 1 or 2 dodge. Just suspicious as it happens way more often then you would expect. \n4. Trinket itemization is very strange, many gamers would agree that getting a piece of gear should never force you to take negative effects. This is definitely one way to piss of your player base. Gamers like to have options, not to be forced into what someone else thinks you should be doing. The more restrictive your game is the less fun it is. \n5. Death is permanent. No way to resurrect dead hero and worst case you have to recruit a level 0 and level it up again, or if your lucky get a lvl 4 hero pop up in the recruitment screen. Easy mode should allow resurrection, and separate that from a hardcore mode that does not. \n6. There is really only one healing class (vestal). Only 2 heals, an aoe heal and single target heal at that. No hots at all. The Vestal is sort of like a mix melee and heals class, not a true healing class. Would like to see healing class more fleshed out with other optional healing classes.\n7. No really good tank class either, mostly its just mixed melee/tank roles. Would like to see a full fledged tank class.\n8. The game economy is terrible. Everything is over priced and the gold you get from missions is super low. You inventory space is horrible as after you stock your provisions for a mission, you may have only 4 slots or less to hold loot. Items also do no stack very high. You will always have to leave a large part of your loot in the dungeon. No way to upgrade or increase slots either. You can actually go on a mission and complete it, get the rewards from the mission and actually still lose gold because you have to spend money in town to fix your heroes. This whole economic issue causes the game to be very slow/grind-ish and is quite unnecessary. \n\nThis game could be a really great game if it had more balance. The difficulty in this game is less based on skill/strategy than it is on RNG, negative effects, bad economic design. I give it a 3 out of 5 rating. \nOne way you can balance out the economy is to edit the .json files that set the prices for training and the rewards for missions. I hate to say it, but sometimes you got to balance things out for yourself if the devs refuse to do so.

(maybe)\n\n- My characters get random negative debuffs at the very end of each mission which isn't explained how it was attained.\n\n- Bettering my characters via weapons/armor feels like an unfair grind as I have to slog through dungeons over and over for GOLD which I don't find fun as I'm risking their lives to make them better. With GOLD.\n\n- If you don't have proper knowledge of how sanity works, increasing roster size for carriage, stress relief, team management, you will find yourself restarting with new saves a lot.\n\n- Now let's not forget gold management as to how on edge you need to be with spending, mainly because if you have a lack of gold you cannot get certain things which are required for doing more missions: Torches, shovel, food, etc. If you fail to have at least 6 torches, 1 shovel and 8 food you risk failing the WHOLE mission due to climbing stress, not enough light and losing sanity from clearing obstacles without a shovel.\n\n(CONTINUED)  Let's say I send a team of 4 on a mission with 100% sanity and they are my only 4 heroes. I buy them 8 food, 6 torches and 1 shovel. That's more that 1000 gold, right? Hopefully the mission isn't too harsh and they come back with 6000 gold (high average for me) and all of them have medium to high sanity loss. I send 2 to the pub and 2 to the church (not 100% possible because of caretaker). Easy 3000 gold. One of them has a disease which reduces their stats by a lot. 750-1000+ gold. Reynauld is also a f*cking kleptomaniac but I cannot cure him for 1500-5000 gold because it would make me go broke.

My playthrough was only about 40h, but I played in the faster \"radiant\" mode which accelerates the progression, and I was still getting bored around hour 15.\n\nI don't recommend it. It's a grindfest with tons of RNG that will force you to do even more grinding if you get screwed over, so you get double-punished for any RNG failure. The parts of it that are genuinely good are not worth the time commitment this game demands.\n\nBut take my opinion with a grain of salt. This game has a massive cult following and me not liking it doesn't change that, so maybe it's worth giving it a chance. But if you end up hating it - drop in a comment here, so I can at least see that I'm not alone. I feel like it takes a specific person to enjoy it and I am not that kind of person.\n\n[h1]Description[/h1]\nIn Darkest Dungeon you will watch over attempts at purging evil from a mansion and it's surroundings by hiring heroes, commanding them on expeditions and rebuilding the hamlet.\n\nDuring expeditions, you can move around a dungeon, explore for items and fight enemies. You command up to 4 heroes and all of them will have 4 skills. Your heroes are organized into a column formation and different skills may only be used from a specific spot. For example in order for your healer priestess to be able to heal - she needs to be at the back 2 spots of the formation, but if you want her to be able to hit things with her mace - she needs to be in the front 2 spots. Moving your heroes around and keeping them in correct spots to maximize their effectiveness is key to survival. Your enemies will be using skills to force your party members out of position, so having means to move them using their own skills is a good idea.\n\nCombat is turn-based, with all characters having 1 action they can use to use a skill or move around forward/backward in formation. Attacks will deal damage, apply debuffs or damage over time - the usual RPG stuff. Different enemies have different weaknesses and tactics, but specific areas of the mansion will have themed monsters that you will learn to build your team around. One area may be filled with enemies that are weak to bleed, but resistant to blight damage, while another may be the opposite.\n\nYou also have stress mechanic. Most enemy attacks and even exploring itself will put stress on your heroes. Too much stress and they may break, making it difficult for you to finish the mission. You can always retreat in shame to fight another day - at least you retain all the loot you already found.\n\nOnce back at hamlet - you can use acquired loot to upgrade various buildings, like Blacksmith who makes upgrades to equipment, or Tavern, which heals stress. This is the main way to progress within the game - embark on expedition, get loot, upgrade Hamlet so that next expedition is easier and cost of healing your surviving heroes is cheaper.\n\nAs you complete missions in different parts of the mansion - you will unlock boss encounters, which need to be tackled in order to unlock access to future ones.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]+ Style[/b]\nDark-fantasy comic style is very fitting the idea of delving inside dungeons filled with things that murder people.\n\n[b]+ Atmosphere[/b]\nIt's heavy and desperate. The voice of narrator really helps bring everything together. His comments reveal backstory, offer encouragement or mock your failings.\n\n[b]+ Mechanically sound?[/b]\nI guess? It must be doing something right when it comes to mechanics, since I didn't hate it for the first 15h and later I got bored not because of the mechanics, but because of constant repetition.\n\nLearning what game has to offer is pretty fun. It's just a shame that there's all-in-all not that much to learn at all.\n\n[b]+ Mods[/b]\nThis is the only reason I might play another round. There are all kinds of mods, from QoL features like bigger stacks of items or new classes to mods that add spice in from of nudity. You can turn most monsters into half-naked anime waifus if you so desire.\n\nReally just for that this game gets a +1 to the score, as we all know - tits make everything better.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]- Padded[/b]\nBetween grinding for upgrade materials/gold, grinding away at hero levels, replacing dead ones and unlocking access to new areas - this game requires a lot of playtime. There is not enough unique content to warrant this amount of repetition in a tactical game based on RNG. Darkest Dungeon relies solely on novelties to keep me interested, and you hardly see or experience anything new after first 10h, but you still have at least 3x as much game in front of you. Even bosses are reused several times over.\n\n[b]- RNG[/b]\nThis game's challenge is solely based on RNG and preparation knowledge. Once you know what heroes, skills and items to pick - there's little in terms of tactical decisions to make during actual combat. Most encounters are trivial if you picked correct party and there are party setups that can deal with pretty much anything in the game, so there's little reason not to take them if you're unsure of what's coming. Bosses require a bit more specific setup, but knowing that requires you to throw your best party in blind and hope for the best.\n\nSo what you are left with for challenge is just RNG, which can screw you over at no fault of yours. Many times you will have to retreat from the dungeon before completing the objective, because RNG can push your party beyond the point at which it's reasonable to continue. There were points where I lost an important hero to a bad RNG string and that resulted in having to retrain a new one in their place, which pads the game even more. It can take many hours to bring a new character up from 0 to max level.\n\nYou cannot win with RNG. You can try to mitigate it, but it's always there, looming over you, waiting to drop onto you like a ton of bricks. And when it does and you end up losing a hero or two - you get set back for hours of grinding.\n\n[b]- UI[/b]\nGrid inventory is unnecessary since all items take same amount of space. Hamlet's roster of heroes gets incomprehensible at some point when you have too many.\n\n[b]- Story[/b]\nAs straightforward and predictable as it gets. There are very few mysteries to uncover and most of it isn't very interesting. Writing is passable at best.\n\n[b]- Items[/b]\nTons of bad items and obtaining good ones is based on RNG, prolonging the grindfest.\n\n[h1]Lowdown[/h1]\nReally the main issue for me is the padding combined with RNG difficulty. If the game was less padded and didn't punish you with hours of grind for a bad string of RNG - I'd probably be less bored with it. Unfortunately making a game like this - a simplified turn-based classic-positional-dungeon-crawler RPG - makes it so it cannot by definition rely on skill. It has to be knowledge-based difficulty, where the only thing stopping you from winning is how much you know about what you will encounter.\n\nSo... while I do think Darkest Dungeon does a lot of stuff right, mainly it's core mechanics, I also have to say I didn't have much fun for the majority of it's elongated playtime.\n\nI'd give Darkest Dungeon a\n[h1]7/10[/h1]\nThis score may be misleading. I rate games based on how well they achieve what they set out to (usually, sometimes I just don't understand what the game wanted to be at all). But I still don't recommend it - why? Because it's a huge time sink and most of it was not fun for me. Just repeatable tasks with same 2 or 3 parties that worked for me over and over again until I finally had enough items and upgrades to tackle something new.", "timestamp_created": 1682622960, "timestamp_updated": 1682672479, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511189877986907959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145899579": {"recommendationid": "145899579", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179422876", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1452, "last_played": 1694758079}, "language": "english", "review": "cock and ball torture simulator", "timestamp_created": 1694160936, "timestamp_updated": 1694160936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510676145553588867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124821969": {"recommendationid": "124821969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321687927", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "playtime_at_review": 19153, "last_played": 1695906316}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Spare the others.

The worldly torment of mankind, however, knows no such restrictions, and it is for this reason that it is the most malevolent and the most insidious of evils, in whatever world or plane of existence in which it may reside.\n\nAs victims of our own presence in this world, are all doomed to a harrowing birth, an agonising life, and a death in which we are consigned to the void and forgotten...this is known. What are seldom known, and seldom pondered, are the reasons that so many adventurers may have come to board the stagecoach and risk themselves in the Darkest Dungeon. Perhaps they have come to loot the gold required to buy bread and tinctures for the ones they value most, to flee the everlasting burdens of war and competition, to no longer be persecuted by the wrathful with torch and pitchfork, or to seek an end to the cruel monotony of their former lives in whatever manner can be provided, death, glory, and worldly pleasures chief among those manners. It is unlikely that we will know, and it is equally unlikely that they will live long enough, or will have the opportunity to make us aware.\n\nIt can be said that the one virtue of the Darkest Dungeon is that it unites those who come to brave its baleful halls. Soldiers of fortune, scholars, outcasts, crusaders, patriots, and unholy disciples alike are unlikely to turn on one another here, and far more likely to unite to defeat the harrowing creatures without and the shared madness within. As their nameless and faceless commander, you alone will decide what the fate of those sent into the Darkest Dungeon will be.\n\nTo succeed in a conventional sense is to know that their lives are expendable, but still worth saving in some cases, and to know that it is almost always wiser to clutch your loot and flee until you have the gold, skills, equipment, and experience required to fight your way through a quest and live to tell about it. If you fail to do this, you and your adventurers will both be punished.\n\nThe longer you play, the better you'll learn to be, helped by a narrator who shares his wisdom regularly so that you may utilise the patience and caution of today overcome the blustering folly of the past, the manner of blustering folly which created this grim, yet oddly generous place to begin with.\n\nIf you can learn from your mistakes and send hundreds to their deaths, entertainment and riches alike can certainly be found...within the halls of the Darkest Dungeon.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1669522008, "timestamp_updated": 1669522008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123535908": {"recommendationid": "123535908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217632267", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1222, "last_played": 1689870912}, "language": "english", "review": "Base game without DLC is seriously barren and disappointing, don't even bother.

Due to having so many details, I had difficulty finding what is just locked in the UI, what is just for looks, and what the game just didn't tell me it was there. This is very noticeable on the town, extending from the places, to how to make the character menus overlap and interact with inventory and so on.\n\nIn combat, it is even worse. Some might figure the equips and uses immediately, some don't, the major issue is how the spells have their effects listed line by line without context and you're just thrown to test them. The game sets you up for failure not because of difficulty but because you need to test them out, leading to a bad run. You just can't properly work with the information you're given until you get used to it.\n\nIt tries to save space on screen for no reason, using abbreviations and so on that you're supposed to know from reading about them elsewhere, on another menu.\n\nA good example of a character I couldn't figure out how to work was the something-arbalest. All i could do was throw flares, i didn't know if i needed to buy ammo for the others to work, if i needed someone else to get a mark and i just fdidn't have them on team, or i just got very unlucky to not have a character with the mark spell unlocked.\n\n4 hours in and I still don't know if I could camp or just didn't get there yet. I just could not find the button even when in the tutorial with the lodge i had to carry.\n\n[h1] Combat and Level Design [/h1]\n\nThat one is the most disappointing. But let's start with the good first:\n\nWhile characters don't have a personality, their quirks become rather interesting initiatives. Either them being masochists or deciding to take the lead to hit or heal someone, is nice. After you learn by testing how some skills work in movement, you very easily get into some combo ideas, and start repeating the classes you know to sit on the village so you can keep a solid strategy.\n\nThere is also a very clear decision that while many characters aren't made to deal that much damage early on, even tanky, heavy hitting characters can take a support build, and when a character is mostly a support, they become weirdly dynamic in the simple positioning of the game.\n\nWith that said, positioning being worth an action feels like a waste of time. Especially when characters can be fearful and retreat, or get pushed. The masked-bard that looks like a ygo card is great to prevent that (he'll move to the front and his finishing move makes him go back), but if your bruiser retreats, she is dead weight.\n\nSometimes very early on you're on a dungeon, you did everything right and you get wiped out because a lot of conditions and stuff. It happens very quickly and while the premise of the game is that you're not safe, not being communicated more clearly on why the difficulty curve suddenly spiked is very frustrating.\n\nWhen the game is just being hard, however, the tension is perfect, you're carefully making moves, trying to keep everyone safe, dealing with the unpredictable and tracing patterns. You're not even frustrated with reinforcements of another 4 enemies or a critical hit. That seems to be the intention of the gameplay loop, and it is VERY engaging.\n\nYou really have to outweight the mission and the value of your characters, how much can they handle, so on.\n\n[h1] What made me quit [/h1]\n\n\nHeart attacks are such a random BS. I was on a great clear, with no character getting less than 70% of their HP down, they got stressed right close to the end (that was a very early, very brief quest), but I played worse, then suddenly on a fight with full buffs, no bleeding, no poison, not even worry because the HP of the enemies was very low at their max, Two characters have a heart attack.\n\nTheir HP went from 90% to 0, [b]I had no idea that was a thing[/b], I just thought something bad happened when the stress hit 200 points, but I wasn't even there.\n\nI try to recover, fight a bit, but when I see it is a lost cause i manage to leave combat. The characters that were healed have a second heart attacks, and PERISH. Then the third character that was fine the whole battle suddenly dies from a heart attack.\n\nThis is very different from when a game throws you a curve ball or you're in say, a monster-house on pokemon MD. You're very early on, you're learning the game, and suddenly something you didn't know was possible ruins the flow of the game, you're not instructed on how to deal with this.\n\nIf I just lost because it was difficult I'd just grind my teeth and move on, but I don't want to be invest hours in a game that just feels like gambling because I didn't know something was a thing,\n\nA few tips: \n\nAxe-lady is by far the most interesting character to collect, giving you several build options, odin-like warrior is a second close, and the tentacle guy is a great support, merchant sucks to heal but can deal damage very fast on the backline.", "timestamp_created": 1681494691, "timestamp_updated": 1681494691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502583980560302734", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127333802": {"recommendationid": "127333802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202514794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1669607938}, "language": "english", "review": "The overreliance on dice roles over strategy destroys any semblance of fun in favor of a grindfest.", "timestamp_created": 1669607647, "timestamp_updated": 1669607647, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502496063709259033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139355192": {"recommendationid": "139355192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030412225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 15085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15084, "last_played": 1686245482}, "language": "english", "review": "Here I will leave the cat, friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064", "timestamp_created": 1685596192, "timestamp_updated": 1685596192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132984518": {"recommendationid": "132984518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047395914", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7926, "last_played": 1684251363}, "language": "english", "review": "More brutal and unforgiving than Dark Souls, Sekiro and Elden Ring combined", "timestamp_created": 1676573097, "timestamp_updated": 1676573097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125255184": {"recommendationid": "125255184", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976957177", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5718, "last_played": 1668098948}, "language": "english", "review": "All the gorgeous artwork and impeccable narration in the world cannot disguise the fact that the entire game is a glorified slot machine. \n\nAlmost every single action in the game is a dice roll.

HA YOU IDIOT! fuck this game. \n\n/nacl", "timestamp_created": 1681049514, "timestamp_updated": 1681049514, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134792217": {"recommendationid": "134792217", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180846900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1690778147}, "language": "english", "review": "good game to pick up if you like dungeon crawling, rogue-like games.

To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure. To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to.\n\nWhat a lot of these reviews miss out is... y'know... the actual review part. On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid. At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair. Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying. Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of \"correct\", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go. The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation.\n\nHOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile. It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it. As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure. DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one. The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part.\n\nAs you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space. Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games. However, the actual result is some very effective tension. In a normal RPG (say... Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a [i] moment [/i] rather than just a nice bonus. \n\nIt can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a \"tactical retreat\" as a failure. Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong.... It takes time to realise that you were never [i] meant [/i] to have it easy, that it's [i] always [/i] been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have. It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure.\n\n Even I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that.", "timestamp_created": 1453726761, "timestamp_updated": 1454088883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1772, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.961481153964996338", "comment_count": 62, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86949901": {"recommendationid": "86949901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053088585", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 6164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5243, "last_played": 1628114746}, "language": "english", "review": "Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer", "timestamp_created": 1613650118, "timestamp_updated": 1613650118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 512, "votes_funny": 63, "weighted_vote_score": "0.956911027431488037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68663522": {"recommendationid": "68663522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142707479", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 9833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6307, "last_played": 1619534282}, "language": "english", "review": "The stress mechanics in game affects you in real life", "timestamp_created": 1588756215, "timestamp_updated": 1588756215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 497, "votes_funny": 546, "weighted_vote_score": "0.954032778739929199", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32140550": {"recommendationid": "32140550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099623766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 4026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3646, "last_played": 1560218056}, "language": "english", "review": "60 hours into the game and I write this review because I've read people mentioning the most simple and constant fact about this game: that it is brutal. Don't expect to always win, or that everyone will always survive. Somebody will eventually die, somebody will eventually go insane, and after that there's just more of that. This games throws whatever it can to make you lose, and even if you win the biggest of fights you won't always be able to win in the end. Why? Because this game takes planning and thinking forward to the extreme, and it will trick you into overextending in some way just so that you will die. And that's great.\n\nThe game itself, being an RPG, has many stats and many mechanics that interact in one way or another with everything else. Then why draw a point to it? Because you must NEVER, EVER underestimate or overestimate those values. The fact that an attack has 80% of hit chance vs a 95% hit chance is huge in the early levels, and as you go up in difficulty those rifts keep getting bigger and bigger, specially when you can find enemies in the early levels with evasion as high as 25. It means you need to plan for it. The fact that an enemy can inflict stress damage to your party, that it can protect another enemy, and that it has particular resistances to certain status can change drastically your aproach to each encounter, and the fact that depending on where you're going you will be facing a specific group of enemies plus some more generic ones. It means you need to plan for it. The fact that you can specialize certain classes to be more oriented towards a particular role (most of the time) and that you have only so much money at hand to do so, and that you need to divide it between that, buying better gear so that they won't die (and further specialize them) and keeping them sane. It means you need to plan for it. If nothing else, this game is a game about planning as carefully as you can, letting as little to chance as you can. Because the more you leave up to chance, the higher the chances something will wipe you out, or that you'll drive yourself into a corner you may not want to go into. \n\nBut then again, as many other reviewers have said, the game gets too hard if you care too much about all of your characters. Having to take care of a roster of up to 26 someway-or-another twisted people can only get you so far, and you won't always be able to keep them safe or have enought money to do so. It is ultimately your choice if you wish to stop caring about everyone but the ones you like the most, or if you wish to go as far a you can trying to veil for both your interests and your whole party's safety. \n\nAlso, you must learn about everything anything in the game can do, and plan accordingly to that, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHAT HAPPENS IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG. If you knows there are enemies that aren't weak to a specific kind of ailment, don't take too many characters that rely on that kind of ailment to do their stuff. If you know an enemy can heal or deal more damage than another, priotize getting rid of either it or the next biggest threat there is besides it. If you know your characters have quirks or traits that affect them in certain scenarios, take those too into account when choosing your party and where to go, if not also how much stuff to take to that mission. If you're trying to kill a enemy that is quite devastating but it can evade everything you throw at him, don't always try to kill it with everything if you are leaving more vulnerable targets that you can kill with less effort stacking up bits of damage against you. Every action, every health, every miss, every hit, every fight and every event inside the dungeons can make a huge difference when stacked. So try to always think over what's the optimal way of doing stuff and, if you don't want to get everyone killed, when you're far enough gone that your only reasonable option is to run away. Luck can be in your favor, but never try to abuse it.\n\nYes. Darkest Dungeon is unfair. Everything can kick your ass if you get caught in the wrong spot, if luck screws you over, or if you try to do more than you can. But if you really want to apreciate it, you must deal with every loss and every death, every failed resolve check and every loss, and learn from it. Try to learn how much is too much, how little is too little, what corners can be cut and what corners cannot. Learn what works with what and what doesn't. And if you really don't want to lose, don't feel bad if you need to go to the wikia to check on what will be expecting you on your next mission. Knowledge, and knowing how to use it properly, is the only thing you can rely on this game, and if you don't want the frustrating trial-and-error you need to get it, no shame in getting it from someone else. It's not as if it tells you everything, but starting from it as a basis and then piling up experience will get you to \"know\" the game, to really \"feel\" when things will go wrong, and if you can deal with a particular situation.\n\nIn conclusion, Darkest Dungeon is really hard, but it can be a rewarding experience. It is opressive by design, since that's how Red Hook wanted it to feel like, just so that every little victory you get is ever the sweetest, and every failure, if you learn from it, a word on caution and the knowledge on how lessen the chances of it repeating itself. Only get it if you think you can deal with stuff not always going according to plan, no matter how well crafted if may be, and getting crushed by letting minuscule things piling up. Those are the bread and butter of the game until you start to get the hang of how to manage those situations, and the real enjoyment of the game (besides maybe a bit of masochism) can only be gotten after it...even if luck can screw you over.\n\nPD: Get mods if you can. Not all of them may be or seem good enough, but all of them add something interesting enough to the game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1496447821, "timestamp_updated": 1496447821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 484, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.944029867649078369", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104395330": {"recommendationid": "104395330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355718537", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4690, "last_played": 1683072627}, "language": "english", "review": "its like pokemon but instead of cute little monsters you collect mental disorders\n", "timestamp_created": 1638036174, "timestamp_updated": 1638036174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 257, "votes_funny": 205, "weighted_vote_score": "0.941877067089080811", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42882701": {"recommendationid": "42882701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014341047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 7512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3891, "last_played": 1685383557}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b][u]Disclaimer:[/u] There is an ongoing issue with the Korean translation. In response to that, many players are leaving a negative review to stick it to the developer. In my humble opinion, the game itself is good. My level of information concerning the translation \u00e9clat is very superficial, but I must stress that before you believe any statements, please do the educated thing and research this topic a bit. Thanks for staying objective here, now on to the actual review.[/b][/h1]\n\nWith age, I have come to appreciate more challenging games like the Dark Souls Series. It always takes a bit of an effort, because if you want to succeed in such games, you need to deal with the mechanics and principles behind the gameplay and deepen your knowledge. My philosophy with Dark Souls was always that it was not hard in itself as long as you listened to the game's \"messages\" and acted accordingly.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is similar at heart. But the difference is that you won't reach a state of overtraining which allows you some easy farming. Instead, your heroes will refuse to go on low level missions once they have earned their wings. The conclusion is that planning is key. You need to get a mental grip on the game really fast and then plan the development of your hamlet along with the development of your heroes. And once you have accepted that the heroes are expendable, the world won't look so grim anymore!\n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is pretty straightforward: You have a team of four heroes, each of which comes with 4 active skills and their current equipment. You go on a mission with a clear goal and with limited resources that cost you gold for each piece you chose to take along. In combat, you have a maximum of 4v4 scenario with turn based combat. The outcomes are influenced by chance, e.g. your damage range might be 5 - 10, which would make a 10 lucky and a 5 unlucky. In that regard, it is very much like a classical RPG when it comes to stats, abilities and chance.\nSo if you have an idea of your heroes, the area and the game in general, you can plan ahead and even prevail if RNG is trying to ra...ttle you! It happens that you get wrecked, but if you learn from that experience, you wil know what to improve for the next try.\n\nWith my current expertise with the game, I'd say the [b]difficulty[/b] remains challenging and taxing even as you get stronger. There are basically 3 tiers of enemy strengths, and once your heroes reach a higher level, they need to go on higher tier missions, as previously pointed out. Gold and resources for the developtment of your hamlet are limited and you need to manage your playstyle in a way that does not leave you bankrupt after a few missions. Chosing which heroes to improve and which to let go is a part of that: Your heroes get positive and negative quirks (attribute modifiers) which can be healed or locked, as well as maladies. It's not always worth to spend your hard earned moola on a hero who has taken a wrong turn. So again, an appropriate reaction is key.\n[i]EDIT: In radiant difficulty, you can use higher level heroes for lower level missions. Yay!\nEDIT2: But you can't take Champion level heroes (5+) on lowest level missions in radiant.[/i]\n\nThe [b]artstyle[/b] is neat and the [b]sounds and music[/b] suit the theme that the game is set in. This is not a happy place game, so don't expect a cheerful tune.\n\nThe [b]game runs smoothly [/b](at least for me) and I have not yet experienced any problems or crashes. I play without any mods.\n\nI do not own the [b]DLCs[/b], so I can't comment on them. But the changes to the core game that came with the DLC seem to be reasonable. The devs have their vision of Darkest Dungeon and so they do not allow cheesing, which is fine by me. So if other reviews put that down as a negative point, then i'd wager they were too lazy to play the game the way it was intended and are now out of their depths with what they have left.\n\n\nIf you have read all the gibberish above, I would like to thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts. There is more to the game than I have written down here, but I don't need to make a dissertation out of it and I have faith that you get the idea of the game by looking at the pictures and watching the videos provided by the dev. I can really recommend Darkest Dungeon, provided that you can manage the above mentioned hurdles. It's not a game to relax and it can drive you up the walls, so don't play when you're already salty. ;)\n\n[spoiler]And if you need to cheer up, I can really really recommend the game \"Slime Rancher\" for that!

Your monument to success here is built atop a mountain of failures. And that mountain will be staggering. Your characters will die, either going down swinging valiantly or from something extremely stupid because the entire world was out to get them at that particular moment. Learn to cut and run and use the resources you gained to upgrade your various systems in town to better maintain the next batch of troops. Sometimes you're just using recruits as stepping stones to get more upgrades to maintain your main fighting force, who are still traumatized from their last incursion or who are getting their negative traits tortured out of them in a medieval sanitarium. The game is designed around this, it expects you to do this, and it will passive-aggressively chide you for doing it. You burn through more recruits than a standard game of XCOM: UFO Defense, and that's an accomplishment.\n\nSo despite all the suffering, is the game good? Extremely. It is remarkably complex, difficult and addicting. You will almost never have an ideal scenario, so you have to learn to adapt to every scenario, learn who or what is worth investing in, and work towards that as your goal. Another body in the ground is another cobblestone on your road to success, and expect the ground to be littered with more corpses of adventurers than you will remember.

Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for \"delaying\" a fight) can just turn them off. Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided. There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful. While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it.\n\nNow that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved. He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase.\n\nThis game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer. It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying. Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty. It has XCOM level \"WTF\" moments. Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings. But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with. \n\nThis game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe. Most of them say things like \"The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy\" or \"the game is anti-fun now\", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it. This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a \"balance patch\", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be \"fun-killing\"). One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything. This is no longer possible. This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me.\n\nI'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion. There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews. This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft. I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours. I really hope you give this game a chance.\n\nEdit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM. It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars. It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer.\n\nRelease Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release.

Let me tell you:  THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS.\n\nI get it, you like hard games which rely on perfect timings and knowledge of the individual frames each move takes up.  This isn't that sort of game.  It's difficult, but it's strategically difficult.  You will always have time to think over your decisions before you make them.  This also means that in order to prevent there always being one perfect move, there is an element of RNG in this game.  Some people enjoy it, some people hate it, some people use it as an excuse for losing.  I hate to break it to you, but if you're losing you're probably making poor decisions.  Just because you lowrolled an occultist heal and that caused a character to die doesn't mean you lost to RNG.  Maybe you went for damage instead of throwing out a stun.  Maybe you didn't bring any stuns.  There are many decisions that go into every consequence in this game, and although you might think you are playing perfectly, you're probably not.  I know I make mistakes quite often.\n\nSo take a moment on this game, give it a try.  Remember: an element of RNG does not mean your decisions don't matter.

Be prepared to experience the consensus \"cons\"; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game.  If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it.\n\nThe most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG.  All of these things exist in varying degrees.\n\nCombat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long.  The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit).  They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat.  If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous.\n\nThe chat bubbles also leave something to be desired.  They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat.  I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted.  This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming.  Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly.\n\nRNG.  I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc).  I've chosen to recant that.  RNG is crippling, but only in the early game.  Darkest Dungeon's biggest  problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance.  Early on, resources are tight.  You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission.  You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels.  Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE. You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc).  Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions.  In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one.  As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful.\n\nGetting crit increases stress by 15-20.  Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10.  Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game.  When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right.  \n\nMy personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order.  There exists a \"SPD\" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order.  Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system.  It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim).  The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack).  This becomes further complicated when trying to \"combo\" attacks.  IE. Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it.  Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action.\n\nBeyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features.  Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me.  I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight.  What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative.  Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive.  I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50.  Not to get too invested in \"real life\" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of \"real life\", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span).  The same could be said of what happens when you \"gamble\" on opening chests/sarcophagus.  It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward.\n\nCombat positioning and class synergy are very cool.  Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time.  This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting.  Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or \"practice\" mode that has some examples of \"combos\" would be helpful.  IE. a guide that says, \"Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T\".  \n\nThe town is also neat.  The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful.  Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming.  Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss.  Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult.\n\nI've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost.  I whole-heartedly disagree.  Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it.  Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does.  Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat.  Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing.\n\nClass balance could be improved.  There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts.  I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless.  Jester, other than people abusing their \"stress heal\" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well.\n\nUltimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay.  Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic.  When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated.  Early game can be THAT frustrating.  Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall.  Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though.  If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun.  My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game.  I suspect we will.\n\nIf you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon.  The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers.", "timestamp_created": 1423181561, "timestamp_updated": 1423720973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 579, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913382172584533691", "comment_count": 48, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112909008": {"recommendationid": "112909008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127645984", "num_games_owned": 510, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 3321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3223, "last_played": 1657012767}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a hard, skill based game with a bit of RNG, you'll like it if you're into tactical turn based games with dark fantasy Lovecraftian setting.\n\nPROS\n- Great narrator\n- Lots of enemies, different maps with a variation of everything from scenery, interactibles, to dungeon music\n- Bosses - each location has its own set of bosses with mechanics for all of them, they're not just reskinned and copy-pasted bullet sponges.

Not exactly inviting to a casual audience, but while fights are brutal and can turn on their head with a single bad idea or coin flip, almost nothing is a permanent loss. Despite often being regarded as a \"rogue-like\", there is no fail state unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty(don't, it's for loonies). Losing battles can be abandoned, recovered from and attempted later. Lost equipment can be reclaimed. Lost heroes can be replaced, but never forgotten.\n\nLike any moderately difficult game, failure is an important part of success, and as such you probably need a good sense of humor about cascade failure and getting screwed over to properly enjoy this game.\nOver time you'll form strategies to effectively counter the painful RNG.\nRNG is present in most any RPG, but in most cases it's fairly easy to ignore.\nIn Darkest Dungeon, it's an emotional rollercoaster and one of the greatest dividers of opinion, because combat is fast(as a turn-based game can be) and harsh, victory never assured even with the best odds.\nThe game tells you right away that it's about making the best of bad situations, and that is it exactly.\nThere is no describing the feeling of missing an 80% accuracy swing for the third turn in a row, being crit'ed to 0 HP(not death, by the way) and for the healer to then crit heal for 0 HP.\nLeper and Occultist for life.\nPersonally this makes the game for me.\nThis is far from being the kind of RNG where you just hit the same button repeatedly until it works. Strategy is very important and very satisfying. The game is long and repetitive, however, and this controlled chaos means that fighting the same enemies with the same party for the fiftieth time could result in any number of wild cards demanding improvisation.\n\nOn that note, the other divisive part of the game is grindiness.\nI actually don't regard it as very grindy, though it's probably a mentality thing.\nI hate grind.

He's done a lot of good work on audiobooks, including Lovecraft stories, and he brought all that good juice in for his deliveries of the strange and dire lines about mortality and cosmic horrors.\n\nDumb footnote, but it probably improved my opinion a bit that it's a game from this decade that I can run on my trash laptop.\nIt's very light on requirements.\n\ntl;dr(wouldn't blame you, pardon the rambles)\nVery recommended, but consider what you're personally willing to put up with.", "timestamp_created": 1624574758, "timestamp_updated": 1624825520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900895476341247559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41067668": {"recommendationid": "41067668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025616678", "num_games_owned": 1540, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 11693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11693, "last_played": 1522425929}, "language": "english", "review": "Year 2018 resolution; review for each game completed!\n\nWhat's there to love? \n\n+Plenty of ways to die aside from the monsters; the mechanism/idea is evil.

It's mostly a resource-management game, where your resources are your heroes and your cash. The game was created to make you struggle on keeping them both in the positive, thus more than half of the experience is planning ahead, measuring the risk and the potential reward, then deciding if it's worth it.\n\nThis isn't a deep, turn-based RPG where you create a party and build them in dozens of different ways to overcome anything. Your options are limited, your heroes have very powerful strengths but most of these are very situational, and that's the weakness everyone shares in this game along with stress. And yes, I also mean [b]you[/b], the player.\n\nYou will want to retreat to a safe spot. You will create a party that you think can overcome anything and once you do it, you'll want to stick with it. And in so doing, you'll lose sight of the reality of your situation. And disaster will come with it. And if you look everywhere and everyone to blame for your misdoings, then you'll be doomed to repeat your mistakes. And when you keep doing them, at one point you'll probably come here, leave a negative review justifying your short-sightedness by blaming the RNG and never, ever touch this great game again.\n\nTo succeed, you need experience. It will give you the knowledge to know which heroes work best in all dungeons, which work best in the Darkest Dungeon quests and which work best for certain bosses. It can only come by making risks that will drive your party to an early grave or succeeding by a breath's hair, then trying again. You can read guides to see which combinations work where, what tools for which dungeon, etc. The wiki is extremely generous in this regard. The RNG *will* ruin you and bring you to the verge of mental collapse because it's supposed to. Plans aren't perfect, everything can go south real fast and you need to have a contingency plan and adapt or forfeit the fight. If you continue to fight against the odds, then don't act surprised that the game tires you when you lost one-too-many heroes due to your decisions.\n\nTake it slow, have patience.

People have commented on the RNG of the game, how the deck feels stacked against you and how your adventurers don't feel like 'heroes' but skittering madmen and how quickly things can get out of control and the grind of recovering your loses. Yes the game 'can' get grindy at times and yes there are times when an encounter will scale so far out of control and you lose some or all adventurers, but despite what some might think this is the minority and most times it is players gambling or pushing their luck.\n\nDarkest dungeon is set almost like in a lovecraftian story, its not about heroes fighitng monsters and smiting their way to victory, it is about clawing and scrambling in an attempt to win a losing battle. The characters or adventures you hire aren't heroes, they are the dredges of the world who are either suicidal or mad enough to venture in. The first time you play you will be blind and as such you will be beaten many times, the bosses in particular are terrifying not so much because they hit hard or have a lot of health (though it doesn't help), but because the way they act or behave is so different to what you have expereinced previously in the game. You will lose characters in this game (it says it right on the box when the game loads), but you learn from your mistakes and you come back with the knowledge of your failed attempts and you succeed and that i think is one of the true enjoyments of the darkest dungeon. Its about surviving the dungeons long enough to find what holds and to exploit your foes with your new knowledge. Its like a combination of Dark souls and the game Risk, the game isn't unfair it's just not lenient and a large portion is simply knowing when to cut your losses and retreat from a dungeon instead of losing characters.\n\nFor those interested but concerend about the reviews concerning grinding or mechanics/difficulty, the game allows you to change and adjust many of its aspects. Radiant mode keeps the difficulty which speeds up adventurer XP gain, reduces gold costs and many other changes which act to reduce the grind as well as slaken some of their strict rules and in the options menu you can change other aspects as well and craft it to how you wish to play the game. Its only on the harder difficulty settings when you are forced to play by the designers rules and even then i find it more enjoyable because it adds a sense of urgency by placing you under a timer (limits how many adventures you can go on and how many adventurers can die) and makes you have to deal with unfavorable circumstances while in the other difficulty settings there is no timer and you simply need time to recover from ANY situation. This game is not for everyone and that is fine, but with the different modes, the ability to customise some mechanics you can tune it to how you wish to enjoy it.

If you're the sort of person who cannot handle loss of any kind, who decries their every death in a game as bullshit, you may find this a little testing. But stick with it, learn to take a hit, and you'll find a pretty nice and cheaply priced game with fantastic aesthetics, tense duels, and a tale behind every hero.\n\nThis is a game dripping with atmosphere, the narrator grimly pronouncing the doom your heroes are charging towards, every inch of dungeon tinged with malice, and every treasure you find a possible liability down the line. The art style is fantastic, rolling with a grim aesthetic to support the grim tasks you assign to the men and women who are drawn to your banner.\n\nThe biggest issue people have with the gameplay is the RNG, but I would argue that this is misplaced. The larger issue is a lack of player agency. I\u2019m a big fan of XCOM, and it works well as a comparison. When I play XCOM, I am given a huge amount of choices, from where to position, who to move first, which alien to target primarily, which cover to destroy, whether to get in close and shock the enemies into incompetence or to force the enemies to move to me and wear them down in a long-range engagement. In Darkest Dungeon, my options are far more limited. Each character can only have 4 abilities at any time, and it\u2019s a lucky day when all four are available for use. And equally, the path most likely to succeed is rarely difficult to figure out. This isn\u2019t an easy problem to fix; it\u2019s a structural issue with the gameplay. But the limited options make it far easier for people to believe that they were simply screwed over by RNG. With more experience and time spent on a campaign, your options become more based on preparation for a mission, how much money you are willing to spend to upgrade your heroes, and which trinkets you are willing to risk to provide them with an extra edge. Even so, tactically the game degenerates into pure dice-rolling more than most would like.\n\nThis level of RNG can be enjoyable in its own way, if you choose to interpret it as individual's heroes performance. There'll always be the one front-line brawler who always crits when it's time to get serious, or a healer who insists on rolling low and sabotaging your run from the inside. There's always going to be the beaten occultist, focused down by every enemy, who finally hits 100 stress but chooses to stand tall in the face of adversity, and inspires the party to drive the beasts back. But still, for those less narratively inclined, the feeling of a run being doomed by simple chance is a hard thing to simply take in stride.\n\nStill, the game doesn\u2019t suffer greatly for that flaw. The game is not about coming home alive every week. The one resource you cannot exhaust is fresh meat to grind against the darkness, so a death is practically part and parcel of scratching your way through the game. In fact, in one campaign that has been remarkably devoid of deaths, I have found it difficult to make room for all the new blood I needed to conquer earlier bosses. Just remember that any losses you take are no more than temporary setbacks, and there will always be more travellers ready to carry the torch further. If you pick up this game, one thing I would suggest is picking up the expanded roster mod at some point. I don\u2019t think the roster has been expanded to handle the new classes that have been added over the game\u2019s life, and a somewhat frustrating feature is that characters will refuse to enter lower-levelled content. It'll technically make the game slightly easier, but I'd say the trade-off is worth it to give you the ability to choose the quest you go on.\n\nGood luck and enjoyment to all those who choose to buy the game.

Darkest Dungeon... I kept myself from writing a review until I was able to finish the whole game. And now that I finally did it, im ready for this. The question is: are you?\n\nThere's a lot to discuss about this piece. You maybe ask yourself : why so much negative reviews about with 100+ hours of gameplay? There is a clear answer (if you haven't read the other reviews, of course) but I'll explain it later. This is gonna be long, I can feel it. Take a cup of coffee and take your time to digest all the information im gonna give you:\n\n>Atmosphere\nSurely the most interesting point of the game. The art style, as you can clearly see is amazing, fabulous. I could even marry it. The characters, environments and enemies are pieces of art incredibly well done. Music rocks too. Narrator is so cool. \n\n>Before going into the combats themselves, I'm concerned I should explain what's everything about in a short way: old rich man living in a town, wow such hookers and alcohol everything is amazing but oh wait my mansion has some kind of dark sorcery stuff better waste all my money in expeditions to find what's all this about. Oh monsters I could never expect this etc etc etc so now the man is broken and needs the help of weirdos that come to the town with the promise of money (more or less like mercenaries, as I see it). Got it? Yep that explanation sucks. But the lore is cool and is better to discover while playing.\n\n>In Darkest Dungeon City Simulator 2420 you have some buildings that must be upgraded in order to be useful. It will take a long to have the Town at its fullest but you know, take it easy. Everytime you do a mission with a party a week passes in the game, and between weeks you can prepare the next expeditions, upgrade buildings, check the lore or cry for the hero \"Trump420blazeit\" that you lost in the last mission.\n\n>RNG: means Random Number Generator, and can be your best friend or worse than Hitler forcing you to eat broccoli. Basically im talking about luck. Darkest Dungeon depends a lot on RNG, is one of the points that people seems to complain about more. I agree with them, because at a certain point of the game your skill does not matter as far as It should. Pray at your god, will be more effective. \n\n>Combats are very well executed and give you the feeling of the battle, but I would like to point the STRESS. It's gonna be your worst nightmare. Your dear ''heroes'' will suffer it a lot when fighting, and when the number reachs 100, you're f****d because it triggers an event. This implies your hero getting totally mad or emerging victorious and becoming the hero of the heroes. Much luck involved again. However, watching your hero becoming the boss of the world among the chaos of the battlefield is amazing. But if he gets mad, he will refuse to be healed or swap position with others, so get ready for the worse. Maybe it sounds obvious, but if a hero dies we won't be able to fight more. Can't bring him to a Pok\u00e9mon Center, you know. Anyway if you're lucky there's some events in town that could... Help you. \n\n> I Tend to call them heroes but they aren't. This is important. They can die. Anytime. Even from a crit of the weakest enemy of the game. But more will come, and after losing your most loved characters a few times you will understand what's all this about. This is about decisions. Every one counts, and can make you achieve a precious victory or lose your entire party when the boss is at 5 hp. Consider when to play safe or take risks, because Darkest Dungeon is excellent at one thing: making you regret your mistakes. (Oh, I still miss Carlos IV).\n\n>Bosses: of course a game of this class must have bosses! Every boss appears 3 times, so you have to beat it in aprentice, veteran and champion. Champion is the real shit and I have to take several pills in order to talk about it without crying, full detail later. (This review is starting to lose the point but I'm actually enjoying it). As I was saying, bosses are extremely difficult without preparation and knowledge about them, so It's on you if checking guides or not. I won't blame you. Nobody will because we all did it after losing an entire party vs the Brigade Pounder ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) But anyway they are very rewarding, in loot and in the feeling of victory.\n\n>Curios: basically furniture and stuff that can be interacted with objects, and can give lots of cash or bleed/blight/diseases/etc If you risk touching them without protection. I suggest checking the wiki in order to not waste many resources, as they are very limited.\n\n>As i pointed a moment ago, the quests of Champion difficulty are crearly unbalanced. Enemies have sick amounts of dodge and critical %, and minibosses appear very often in the rooms you explore. In these missions is where RNG shines a lot, and if you didn't take interest in understanding how curios and positioning works you'll fail miserably. Or not. Who knows?\n\nNOW LET'S FACE THE REAL SHIT\n\n[b]YOU THOUGHT PEOPLE ONLY COMPLAIN ABOUT RNG? OOH POOR FOOL [/b]\n\nOnly if you're ready I'll proceed to explain what made me hate the game as much as I love it.\n\n>The fact is... Well... The last scenario is the Darkest Dungeon (no spoilers, chill) and consists of 3 missions + the final boss itself. To complete this missions you'll need to farm a lot. But a lot. I mean send parties and parties of low level just to get loot, die and be replaced to use this money to enforce the best members of the roaster. Because you'll spend an indecent quantity of money in replacing quirks, curing diseases, upgrading armors and weapons and curing stress. Then you'll have an entire party at It's maximum and all of them will die in the mission of the last scenario :D Because this is it huahauah I'm not even mad but It happened to me and FeelsBadMan it hurted more than my father's belt.\n\n> I completed the game (including all the bosses) in 280 weeks aprox, but I took my time. The most sick players do it in like 22 weeks but trust me is a suicide. Just take your time and enjoy the game. There's no rush and It's hard to get used of it.\n\n>The developers seem to take care of their game, because are nowadays upgrading free content, events, new quirks and even enemies. The patch had some major bugs and were fixed in less than an hour so hey! I appreciate that. On the other hand, a DLC is coming soon and still can't tell much about it. For now I only know I'll go back to Stardew Valley in a journey to forget everything I saw in Darkest Dungeon. Too much feels, too much emotions.\n\n>For now, this is It. I don't know if someone will even reach this point of the review but if you did thanks for reading! Hope it helped you. I completely recommend the game if you're looking for a challenge in your Steam library. Even after all the bad moments Darkest Dungeon gave to me, I'm still gonna hit the ''Yes'' button of recommendation.\n\n[i]\"Sucess so clearly in view...

YOu recruit heroes, send them into dungeons on mission and hope they survive. The missions and layouts of the dungeons are more or less randomized as are their contents. Death is permanent. And that will be counted as a mercy.\n\nThe unique mechanic of this game is the Stress (not sanity) meter, the afflictions/virtues, and quirks. Mental health is just as important as physical health and as your heroes areexposed to the terrible eldrich horros and abominations that make mockery of flesh and form, they will slowly but surely go insane.  Once a hero takes a certain amount of stress damage they will become afflicted by varuiouus conditions. This can have varying effects from causing erratic statuses, actions, and in somecases causing them to attack other heroes.\n\nAfter missions your heroes will develop quirks. Some beneficial that ad bonuses, but most will be negative that make heroes weaker. The more missions a hero goes on the more experience and levels they gains but also the more of these quirks they pick up.  Stress and  these quirks can be treated of course, for a hefty fee.\n\nTough choices will have to be made.\n\nOne of the best things is that the devs do regullarly return to add new content.

Before I might have shrugged this off, assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone. But I\u2019ve played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line, it\u2019s a warning. \n\nDarkest Dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game I\u2019ve ever seen before. The gothic-inspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices I\u2019ve ever heard in a game. Beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting. \n\n[b] Gameplay\t[/b]\n\nThe premise of the game is simple; you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land. In order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons, four at a time, to complete various tasks. Achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on. This includes your heroes, their mental and physical well-being, their equipment, and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive. \n\nThere are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group. Your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line, and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemy\u2019s line. You must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon and/or boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon is the affliction system, which dictates the psychological state of your heroes. Every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level. If their stress level gets too high, they will respond physically to their emotional state. In rare cases this might actually give them a bonus, but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive. The stress system is not something to be ignored, and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes. \n\n[b] Preparation is Key\t[/b]\n\nBefore even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen, where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon. It is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into; as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage. By paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold. It is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon. This might be an annoyance to some, but I think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money.\n\n[b] A Difficult Journey\t[/b]\n\nWith the game saving automatically as you go along, there\u2019s no ability to fall back on save-scumming to avoid disastrous situations. A mistake in planning can prove to be fatal, causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling, but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with. In order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face. Making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters. Progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that I believe only comes with games that actually challenge you.\n\n[b] My Verdict\t[/b]\n\nI truly love this game and can\u2019t recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon.", "timestamp_created": 1461383641, "timestamp_updated": 1551709929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 333, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879688441753387451", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32944811": {"recommendationid": "32944811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000885351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 34742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31456, "last_played": 1612906718}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE: Scroll down for the DLC (Crimson Court/Shieldbreaker) reviews.\n\nYou will buy Darkest Dungeon. You will carefully assemble your team. You will curse loudly when they die.\n\nYou've probably heard this game be compared to Dark Souls at some point, but that doesn't really capture the whole picture. Darkest Dungeon is a game where you manage a GROUP of Dark Souls players--you'll organize them, prepare them, set the ball in motion with commands, but the burden of success lies at least partially with them. Out of your hands. As with real players, your characters will have a margin for error. You can minimalize it with planning, trinkets, and practice, but it will be there. Sometimes they will surprise you, somehow surviving certain death. And sometimes, everything will go wrong.\n\nIf you're still with me after that description, I can't recommend this game enough. I bought it in Early Access and my only regret is that I didn't find it earlier on Kickstarter so I could have backed it. Darkest Dungeon is packed with a character all its own, from the stress/affliction system, to the art, to the compelling narration of Wayne June as the Ancestor. The story is satisfying and as Lovecraftian as you would hope.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying, it's worth the price of admission. Much more so if you catch it on sale. I bought the DLC and will update this review once I've finished it.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nDLC: Crimson Court\n\n-TL;DR I bought it, it was fun and neat, I'd buy it again and maybe a third time.\n\nGood: New content, new bosses, plenty of narrator voice acting, swathes of new awesome loot, tons of cool monsters, chance to have vampires working for you.\nBad: Intense difficulty spikes throughout the DLC, may be compeletely overpowering for new players, Crimson Curse is hard to deal with, RNG remains your God.\n\nWARNING - This DLC directly increases the difficulty of the base game. If that's not something you want, you might be frustrated with this DLC.\n\nI was hesitant to buy this DLC, I'll be honest. The core story was already polished and whole, and it felt like additions would be forced and possibly trite. Furthermore, there are few horror genres as tired and overdone as the Vampire. Still, I gave it a chance and, whew, what a ride. Where to start?\n\nTo begin with, the Crimson Court integrates itself into the game seamlessly and quickly. With the DLC active, you get a lead into this new side of the game as early as the first embarked mission (beyond the tutorial). Afterwards, you quickly tumble into a tempting new area, gated by a hidden challenge, that unleashes a new, and very immediate, peril upon the Hamlet. As is typical of Darkest Dungeon, when I say \"peril\" I mean that your heros can (and probably will) die of this new problem - The Crimson Curse.\n\nWhat's more, progressing through the DLC produces a taut, but pleasing, tension as the stakes grow higher and the need for the next goal accomplished becomes more immediate. For each of the three Expedition tiers (Apprentice, Veteran, and Champion), there is a story arc is told through normal expeditions, events in the Hamlet, narration, and in the Courtyard itself. After each tier, there is a break in which you can progress the normal game.\n\nPossibly the most fun part for me was the Trinket Sets. The art and flavor text on them are great, giving us hints at the origins of the various heroes of Darkest Dungeon, as well as providing interesting or powerful bonuses that set them apart from other trinkets. After collecting each and every set, I found it was definitely worth doing so, but I did not feel that the trinkets were required. In many cases, normal trinkets were far superior.\n\nI'll also say that the story of the Crimson Court was surprisingly satisfying. The extra cutscenes and narration made it feel like money well-spent. I will say, though, that it's easy to put yourself in a completely untenable position by opening the \"Pandora's Box\" too soon. You will need to learn how to deal with the Crimson Curse fast, and dedicate time and effort to resolving the story of the DLC or risk losing valuable heroes to the thirst.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nDLC: Shieldbreaker\n\n-TL;DR She's awesome. Definetly worth 4 bucks on her own, and she comes with story, new enemies,  and new goodies.\n\nThe Good: No impact on difficulty, new expendable item that has a unique effect, Shieldbreaker is a badass with unique skills that make her fun and useful, breathes new life into Mark teams, additional blight support, unique counter for guard/PROT, her story is exciting to unravel. \nThe Bad: Compared to Crimson Court, there's not really much here. Three new enemies, an handful of trinkets, and a new hero. \n\nAfter the Crimson Court, I would have bought any DLC for this game. My first thought was that the Shieldbreaker DLC is mostly for diehards, but after giving it a chance, I was very excited at the relatively lengthy revelation of the Shieldbreaker's tale, told through normal gameplay. I can't say too much without major spoilers, but I will tell you that her special events do NOT happen in Crimson Court expeditions, so if you're trying to explore the Shieldbreaker's content, focus on the main areas of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1498667751, "timestamp_updated": 1510027631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 147, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879456579685211182", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68700571": {"recommendationid": "68700571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331908183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 924, "last_played": 1641192526}, "language": "english", "review": "yea good game\n\nOccultist: *heals 0*\n                *heals 1*\n                *heals 0 with bleed*\n\nI let my Occultist die of heart attack after that", "timestamp_created": 1588806814, "timestamp_updated": 1588807210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 179, "votes_funny": 412, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877088785171508789", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116998371": {"recommendationid": "116998371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302319309", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7213, "last_played": 1684006873}, "language": "english", "review": "god i hate this game so much", "timestamp_created": 1655251736, "timestamp_updated": 1655251736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874930858612060547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45694038": {"recommendationid": "45694038", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994623075", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 10321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7534, "last_played": 1553253926}, "language": "english", "review": "DARKWST DUNGEON IS NOT A DUNGEON COMBAT GAME, it is a MANAGEMENT game. (Skip to the end if you want tl;dr)\n\nI noticed a lot of reviews citing the game as \u2018too hard\u2019 or \u2018all about rng\u2019 and I can tell you exactly why: those players were expecting a generic dungeon crawler where you can kerbstomp every boss with high level and super gear, and the managerial risk mitigation required in Darkest Dungeon (DD) is foreign and alien to them.\n\nAll the RPG nowadays features the player as this, omnipotent chosen one who is out to save the world single handly, DD subverts that 100%. Your team sports heros with mortal characteristics of strength and weakness, vices and fears that is nothing like the \u201cchosen one out to save the world\u201d. \n\nThat is fine, we have seen that in lores before but here is the kicker - You got to manage those flaws in DD! In fact, if you have worked in a corporate environment DD will be a piece of cake for you, since it is all about risk assessment and human resource (HR) management. \n\nWhat about the rng? \n\nLet's cover the risk assessment: to put it simply, you look at the LIKELIHOOD (rng) and CONSEQUENCE of a RISK to get a risk score, and you assign CONTROLS to reduce the two aforementioned factors. \n\nSay if my vestel is highly prone to stress in dark due to quirks, we have \u201cRISK\u201d of her getting psyched out and become incapable to heal. The \u201cCONSEQUENCE\u201d of that would be wiping and losing the juicy trinkets your squad has (catastrophic) and the chance of me having no torch may occur in long dungeons (possible). \n\nSo now, the typical gamers have two response : Vestel heal is weak, or negative quirks are too strong. They look at problems NOT solutions. \n\nTo a thinking gamer, a CONTROL will be applied. \nI can reduce the likelihood (rng)  by\n-Curing the quirk (if time permits)\n-Bring more torches \n-Have a man of arms to guard her\n-Have ranged damage that can wipe out stressors on round 1, IE dogs and highwayman\n\nTo reduce the consequence by\n-Strict retreat protocol- if the healer is not coping, escape combat \n-Have a crusader that can reduce stress\n-Have stress reduction camping skills\n-Have self heal on dps to reduce healer workload\n\nNow we have applied control, we have reduced the likelihood (rng) of healer getting psyched out from possible to unlikely level. And even if the healer does get psyched out we have controls to reduce the consequences from catastrophic to minor (if they retreat they go to town have a break no biggie). \n\nIt is understandable that risk management skill do not exist in the immature adults or children who have been fed with hero complex and unable to accept compromise, it is easier to just blame it on rng. \n\nWhile the game does have certain shortfalls like slow combat animation, overall it has pioneered a new type of dungeon crawler that's a fresh breeze compared to the old and outdated \u2018grind to max level and save the world\u2019 model. \n\nIn Conclusion:\nNot saying you have to like the game or agree to the review, but this is just not the typical game where god gear will win you 100% of the games, and if challenging games isn't your thing, you may need to reconsider purchasing it.

To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.\n\nThe changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision\u2014your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle. \n\nBack before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.\n\nTL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.\n\nAs for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits. There is some aspect of grind, and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming, but I enjoyed myself the whole time.\n\nIf you're on the fence with the one, the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy. It's not for everyone, and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if you're not into that sort of thing.

I picked this game up right after its release and unlike most people I like it now more than I did before, allow me to explain why this game is easily worth the $20.\n\n[b] First of all you won't like this game if you fit into the following two categories: [/b]\n[olist]\n[*] If you don't like turn based games or RPGs this game isn't for you, pretty strait forward. \n[*] If you don' like a challenge, and I mean a real challenge, if you put most of your games you play on easy and then prance through them congratulating yourself on a stellar job this game will bury your pride along with your party of heroes pretty fast. Its hard. \n[/olist]\n\n\n[b] Why do I like this game (the pros): [/b]\n[olist]\n[*] The narrator is great. fits the mood so well and makes everything come to life with the expansive vocabulary and deep timbre.\n[*] The artwork. Its superb, every review out there whether positive or negative will say it. It has the best art of any game I have seen a long time and like the narrator it helps the world come to life. The animation, though minimalist, is beautiful and powerful and really helps you feel the game. The sound is also great and helps build mood as it changes depending on how dark it is in the dungeon. At pitch blackness you hear the squeals, groans, shouts, or other sounds of the dungeon enemies off in the distance and during battle the music is louder and more ecstatic, making everything so much more tense. The aesthetics of this game alone make it work and suck you in, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg.\n[*] The gameplay (I said it, and I'll talk about why other people be hating later). I have always loved tactical turn based and this game is the cream of the crop. There are so many options when it comes to how to defeat your opponents. The enemy monsters are varied and that determines the tactical choices you make. It is brutally unforgiving and thus it takes actual planning to get a good hero lineup and execute with top efficiency; however no hero, ability, trinket or consumable is overpowered (some people say monsters are overpowered... but I'll get to that later). and there are so many ways and lineups to be used to clear dungeons. The tactical battles and overall strategy (the economy, stress heal, and leveling up) go hand in hand.\n\n\n[b] So why are other people not suggesting the game? [/b]\n\nYou can scroll through all the negative reviews but you only really need to read one to read all it basically: \"the patch ruined everything.\" But yet I don't buy into that train of thought and I will explain why:\nPre-corpse and hound patch the game way simply too easy, it was all over the forums too. \"This game is too easy its boring\" or \"after early game its a walk in the park\" were the complaints. Unlike currently there was an \"overpowered\" strat where they would take a crit loaded team with two powerful front line hitters and two back line supports into a dungeon, snuff the torch, and then go ham destroying the front line enemies thus exposing the back line enemies while the supports buffed them up to hit even harder. Battles could be over in two turns. Heroes that didn't work into that formula were never used, like the grave robber, plauge doctor, crusader and bounty hunter. Yes every hero was viable but nothing could clear dungeons like a crit loaded dark run (they also gave you the most gold because as the dungeons get darker the more gold you can find). \n\nThe Corpse and the hound added two unique mechanics that threw off the crit loaded dark runs. The first was corpses. Now when you kill and enemy his corpse remains, meaning that the weaker back line enemies can stay safely in the back line and keep throwing their stuff at you. This screwed over the crit-dark runs because now you had to hack through an enemy and then hack through his corpse to clear a path the back lines, making the battle go longer and thus their crit-dealing heroes took more damage. \n\nThe second mechanic added was PROT or protection to enemies, heroes had always been able to get PROT by the means of a trinket but it was never that big a deal (why would you get a PROT trinket when you could just get a trinket that would boost your crit chance for your crit-dark runs?) PROT basically mitigates damage taken, and now that enemies had it (some had very high amounts) it took the crit-dark run damage dealers a few turn to hack through what used to be an instant kill. Both these additions made battles last longer but also opened the space for new mechanics and strategies. now dark runs were much more risky because of the amount of damage you could rack up (in the dark monsters hit harder and more accurately). But an added mechanic was the DoTs (damage over time affects) like poison and bleed completely ignored PROT and if you killed an enemy with DoTs it didn't drop a corpse. The heroes that had DoT's were the heroes that were considered useless before the patch, they didn't become super overpowered they simply became an actual option that could work. \n\nBasically \"the patch\" made the game harder and that cause a lot of long time players that had forgotten difficulty and were (to use game analogy) \"fattened by decadence and luxury\" to rage because they were unable to adapt. People say things like \"This game used to be a gem and now I would recommend it to ANYONE!\" the unfortunate thing is that if the game had had these mechanics since the beginning everyone would have loved it due to the difficulty. And even if you are scared by all the \"the patch ruined everything\" reviews, know that the developers knew this would happen. In the corpse and hound patch notes they said at the end that \"we will be tweaking these mechanics because we won't know the exact results until after implementation\" and they have as of 8/18  nerfed enemy protection and made corpses weaker.  \n\n\n[b] Final thoughts [/b]\n\nI love this game, and the devs, Its only gotten better for me. I encourage anyone looking for a challenging game that will pull them into the lore and world to look past the negative reviews that all say the same thing.

Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game... to a certain breed of gamer. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, the good.\n\n[i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a masterfully crafted game. The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth. The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the \"hard\" end of the spectrum. Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered.\n\nThe stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games. The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the [i]Cthulhu[/i] games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here.\n\nOh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game.\n\nThe game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that. It's not bad. In fact...\n\n[b]KR Rating: [5] GREAT[/b]\n\nBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad. As I said before, [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a hard game.\n\nWell, no, that's not really accurate. [i]Etrian Odyssey[/i] is hard. That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is not hard, it's unfair.\n\nSee, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called \"curios\" in the game) that litter the dungeons. Then you get into that one battle. You know the one I mean. It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard. It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time. Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit. Before you can even click the \"retreat\" button half your force is at Death's Door... or through it. It's a little like [i]Dark Souls[/i] in a way.\n\nAnd the thing is, that's not an accident. I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is. This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point. It's the underlying design philosophy of the game.\n\nThe developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate.  There are no badasses in the [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i]. There are no heroes.\n\nNo, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good. (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier.)\n\nThat's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just \"recommend\" or \"not recommend.\" Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made. It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be. It is a GREAT GAME.\n\nBut \"great\" and \"universally enjoyable\" are not the same thing. A lot of people don't like hard games. I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people.\n\nIf I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority.\n\nThat said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now. It's only $19.99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist.\n\nIf you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one.\n\n([url=http://knightlyreviews.blogspot.com/2015/10/video-game-review-darkest-dungeon.html]Read the review on Knight's Reviews by clicking here.[/url])", "timestamp_created": 1443695224, "timestamp_updated": 1443695559, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1942, "votes_funny": 65, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869245409965515137", "comment_count": 111, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103287643": {"recommendationid": "103287643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105956825", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1679615689}, "language": "english", "review": "Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.\n", "timestamp_created": 1637606692, "timestamp_updated": 1637606692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869000613689422607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57841665": {"recommendationid": "57841665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120859221", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 293002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269436, "last_played": 1686758484}, "language": "english", "review": "Played it a little, not bad.", "timestamp_created": 1574716409, "timestamp_updated": 1574716409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 196, "votes_funny": 681, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867112874984741211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74793188": {"recommendationid": "74793188", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964867567", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 12911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12897, "last_played": 1598205687}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Wounds to be tended; lessons to be learned.\" This is a comment the Narrator of Darkest Dungeon may make to you the first time you lead a party to failure in your quest to combat evil and corruption. Any heroes that manage to return from a failed expedition to the dilapidated hamlet may carry back some treasures, but also diseases, stress, afflictions of both mind and body. And hopefully, while they have gained injury, as a player you will have gained knowledge to improve the next expedition in this fantastic tactical RPG.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a punishing game, one that expects you to fail and learn from those failures. Heroes that rally to your desperate cause are a motley assortment of already damaged men and women, each implied to be seeking redemption or to atone from some dark past of their own. In the hamlet, you can spend money to upgrade these skills of these adventurers, upgrade their equipment, or send them to heal from the stresses of facing horrors with meditation, prayer, booze, or the brothel. While your hit points are automatically healed after each mission (if they come back -- deaths are permanent), the stresses endure, and maintaining the mental health of your roster is vital to long-term success. Thankfully, if heroes die -- and die they will -- more can always be recruited.\n\nWith your party healed, you send them in again, to both defeat the horrors that surround the hamlet, and to bring back the treasure and items needed to slowly upgrade the hamlet and give you slight advantages. Combat is turn-based, with both your party and enemies standing in rows of four. This positioning makes up a large part of the tactical decisions of the game. Characters have four abilities, each of which can only be used in certain positions and can hit certain rows. Additionally, many abilities are complimentary. The Occultist can mark enemies, for example, while the Arbalest gains a bonus to marked targets. Learning how to build parties that build on each other's skills -- and attempt to compensate for weaknesses -- is another large part of the tactics you learn. Your roster levels up as you learn these mechanics, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the varied enemies you face. Eventually, you may even be brave enough to send your heroes to combat the evil in the manor itself.\n\nIn addition to the satisfying tactical combat, the game has a fantastic Lovecraftian aesthetic and theme in story, art, sound design, and animation. This is most evident in the Narrator, who comments on events as you play with a rich, dramatic delivery that might be almost camp, if it were not so skillfully done. If you heal a party member back from the brink of death, the might say, \"Death cannot be escaped -- but it can be postponed.\" Kill a large, powerful enemy, and he might tell you, \"Prodigious size alone does not dissuade the sharpened blade.\"\n\nDarkest Dungeon is punishing at every turn, forcing you to learn, to refine your tactics, to push to the edge of success or failure over and over. This can be frustrating at times -- complaints of \"grind\" in this game do have some merit -- but I found the gameplay loop consistently fun, even when it was punishing my failures. As the Narrator might say, \"Where there is no peril in the task, there can be no glory in its accomplishment.\"", "timestamp_created": 1598203677, "timestamp_updated": 1598203677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867066860198974609", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98086117": {"recommendationid": "98086117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026663817", "num_games_owned": 956, "num_reviews": 341, "playtime_forever": 8866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8866, "last_played": 1572533458}, "language": "english", "review": "When I bought this game quite a few years ago, someone wrote: \"This is a great game, but ultimately the RNG and the difficulty is what makes it unplayable\". Naturally, I dismissed it, thinking that I'm going to do better. 150 hours later, I'll say this instead: This is a great game, with some design choices which accentuate the futility of the fight against the unspeakable. In other words, your carefully trained and equipped heroes will die - inglorious, meaningless deaths. That's what it means to stand against the eldritch.\n\n\"Big deal\", you probably think. \"The game clearly states in its trailer:  all that awaits you is madness and death. What did you expect? Also, how is it any different from any other hard game where you die a lot?\" Fair point. Let me explain, but let's take a look at something else first.\n\n[h1]Venerable opulence[/h1]\nThe first thing you see when you look at this game is the general feel. And let me tell you: it gets much, much better than that. The symphony of the look, the music and the narration is mesmerising. The way it compliments and reacts to the gameplay is nothing short of fantastic. The battle music changes depending on your torch level, which is a self-imposed risk-reward mechanic (the darker it gets, the more violent and dangerous the fight is, but you get better loot). The narrator reacts to almost everything that happens, either foretelling your upcoming doom, congratulating your character on a crit, reminding you to not get too cocky. Wayne June is doing Elder God's work - his voice acting is easily 30-40% of the game's appeal. On an unrelated note, check out his readings of Lovecraft.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is: the game excels at luring you in. You want to explore, you want to cleanse, you want to find more riches to expand your town, strengthen your heroes and to go fight nastier and nastier abominations. And so you continue.\n\n[h1]Triumphant pride[/h1]\nAfter a while, you get good at it. You start understanding how positioning works, how stats interact, which classes work well together. You begin to understand which classes compliment each other and what team compositions work against which areas and enemies. You will probably lose a few dear heroes. But that's alright, every death is a lesson learned. You know which situations call for pressing on, and which situations are unsalvageable and demand retreat. Risk management is a constant companion here. \n\nYou use your newfound skills to cleanse the areas of the game. To defeat bosses, which are interesting and unique, if challenging, encounters. You'll probably hit roadblocks, will be forced to rethink your strategy. Sometimes you will lose just because fate (RNG) said so. But this is all acceptable. Eventually, you push through, and emerge victorious.\n\n[h1]Dizzying fall[/h1]\nAt this point I should mention that in order to level your characters you need two things: gold and experience. Gold buys you better gear - which is mandatory later on, as it also affects things like dodge or accuracy - and experience, well, levels your guys up. Characters at certain levels can only go on expeditions suited to their level. If it's too easy for them, they will flat out refuse to go. If it's too hard, they will gain additional stress and probably get massacred anyway. As such, you have to constantly keep teams of people available and have high-level reserves, because if someone needs to recover from an expedition or, worst case, dies, you must plug the hole somehow. \n\nPoint is: levelling people is hard. It's a very grindy process. High level champion with gear is worth their weight in gold. Which is why the final dungeon is such a stab in the heart.\n\n[h1]Darkest Dungeon[/h1]\nThere are three things to note about the final expedition. First, it contains completely new, original, and very difficult enemies. You need to learn to fight them. You will lose just by virtue of trial and error, and even fully powered heroes feel underlevelled. Second, once a hero has entered the dungeon once, they will never again be able to enter due to sheer terror. As such, you have to make every expedition count. Third, there is no escape. Up until now retreat was always an option, but here if you try to escape one of your heroes will randomly die to cover for the rest.\n\nCombine this with the fact that every single hero that is even allowed to enter must have maxed out level and stats and maybe you can begin to see the sheer magnitude of grind required to even \"git gud\", much less succeed - as stated before, sometimes you just can't win because of circumstances. And that's okay, or at least it would've been if the price of failure wasn't so exorbitant.\n\n[h1]The end, such as it is[/h1]\nIt's such a shame. I really loved this game. Even while writing this my heart races as I think of the great expeditions I had. But in the end I decided I simply do not have the patience, time, or will to grind out yet another batch of fodder for the final expedition. I like to think that this is the point the game set out to make - you can't fight the eldritch. I am sure there are people who have succeeded. In the end, with patience and luck you probably can beat the game. But I can't.\n\nI have descended into madness instead.\n", "timestamp_created": 1629714898, "timestamp_updated": 1629714898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1332, "votes_funny": 99, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866600334644317627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24070475": {"recommendationid": "24070475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041093909", "num_games_owned": 863, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1868, "last_played": 1692324060}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's why people are giving negative reviews: because they want everyone to be alive in their roster.

I wasn't planning on playing over 100 hours of the game before making a review. I had originally planned to write it before, but my boyfriend encouraged me to wait until I beat the game or at least until I tried a serious run on the Darkest Dungeon. That is why it took me so long to write this.\nI got this game as a gift from boyfriend a couple of years ago, though even before that I had already seen him play the game quite a bit, and I really enjoyed it. There was just something about the dark nature of the game that just drew me in, so I was so happy when I got this game. And with all the hours I have put into the game, there are definitely some aspects I like, feel mixed about, and don't like, which is why I am going to make a review on it. Just keep in mind, I haven't finished the game completely. The most I have done is to do a serious attempt on the Darkest Dungeon once, so with that in mind, don't think there will be anything regarding the ending.\n\nSo, let's begin with the review!\n(Also, just for the record, this will probably be a long review, so bear with me)\n\nThings I like about the game:\n1. The different characters one can play as (and all the combinations for teams): So, one thing I really liked from the beginning was just how many different classes there were and how many different builds one could make. I feel like it gives you the ability to put your own style of gaming into the team you create. If you want a more damage dealing team, you can do it. If you wanna focus on evasion, you can do that too. And the amount of different styles is so fun. Whether it be damage, stress, glass cannon, evasion, prot, etc. It's just really fun to tinker around with them, and seeing what combination works best.\n2. The Narrator: Oh my god. I think most people who have played this game (Or well, at least the people I have known who also have this game) have commented on the narrator and his quotes. And honestly, that just makes the game so much more entertaining. Like, that voice and those lines just...have a way of sticking on you. To the point, my boyfriend, a friend of ours, and I just sometimes quote the narrator out of nowhere. So yes, I had to add that as something I like xD\n3. The music: So, I am usually the type of person who let's the music speak for the game in a lot of cases and Darkest Dungeon is no exception to that. Though there are many occasions I don't play with music in this game (for whatever reason), I do really like the music in the game. I think it speaks a lot about what is going on in the game, especially when it comes to all the stress and darkness that is occurring. \n4. The enemies/bosses (how diverse they can be): Now, while I was thinking of putting this in the mixed section of this review (because some enemies can just be absolutely tedious to deal with), I just love how original the designs are. Like, especially when one goes into the harder dungeons, I like how disturbing the enemies look and it's just so....amazing. The bosses are also pretty cool in regards to their looks (though some of them can be extremely annoying to face, which comes from me who swore to defeat all bosses before going into the Darkest Dungeon). \n5. How the dungeons map change every time you go in: I don't think I need to explain this much further. I just feel it adds a sense of difference each time you go into a dungeon. \n6. The mods: To be honest, this is the first game I have ever played while using mods, and oh my god. Do they add to the experience. So, when I first saw my boyfriend play Darkest Dungeon for me, I didn't know he was using mods (since a lot of the character just blend in so well with the entire game). This got me into using some of those mods, as well. And I will tell you, it makes such a difference. The mods that fit in so well with the game that you don't even realize they are mods and just the different types of characters that are added with those mods is just so fun and amazing.\n\nNow, that I've mentioned some of the things I like, time to bring up things I am more mixed about. \n1. The difficulty: Now, I wasn't really certain on where to put this, as it is something that adds a lot of charm to the game and a lot of satisfaction when one succeeds. However, there are just some things that I find just...so difficult that it makes me go crazy. Now I played this game on Radiant, and you would think, it would be a walk in park. It isn't and I knew that. But just seeing some of the things my boyfriend has experienced in harder difficulties, and what I experienced in the Darkest Dungeon (and that's excluding what I have faced in regular dungeons) and it's like....How's one supposed to beat that? So yeah, I needed to put this in mixed feelings. \n2. How certain items you interact with can do barely any good: So, for people who have played this, it's hard not to mention the different items you can interact with on your way through a dungeon. And while I am not against putting both good and bad items in the game, I will say that some items...it's like there isn't even a point to interact with them cause all they do is bad. Like, with other items, there are percentages and it's up to you if you want to take the risk or not of interacting with them, but then there are just some that immediately you should steer clear from. And it's...a very mixed feeling I have on that. \n3. The length of some dungeons: You know, I won't go into too much detail on this. All I will say, is that (1) I am just happy that I can choose what type of dungeon I can go through (from short to long) and (2) I think I have only done a long run in a dungeon once, because I felt it was so tedious to do the long ones. Like I am okay with camping once, camping more than that....ehhh. Yeah.\n4. The inventory size: Oh boy, I am surprised this didn't end up on the dislike side of this review. But you know, it's very mixed. On one side, I can kind of understand why the inventory is so small (especially on a game where supplies should feel a bit more limited), it can get kind of annoying at times. Like sometimes I just wish that as you progressed, you could get more inventory size. But, overall, it's nothing too bad that it ruins my experience.\n\nAnd those are the things I feel mixed about. When it comes to things I dislike about the game, I couldn't really think of any except well...the collector! Because he just annoys me, especially when he pops out of nowhere to ruin my run) and well, sometimes the whole equipping trinkets and upgrading gear can get quite tedious, but that's just more because I forget to do it (and my bf and our friend wonder how I am able to progress without doing that).\n\nOverall, I really love this game. Despite it's downfalls and things I feel mixed about, I really love this game and would even go so far as to say it is one of my favorite games right now. There's just soo much to do and so many hours you can put into this game. It's so fun! I would recommend it to anybody who likes these dark types of games with turn-based strategy. And well, that's all I have to say for this review.\n\nPS: It took me a bit over an hour to write this, so there are probably some things I forgot, but overall this review gives my point of view on the game as well as I possibly could.\n", "timestamp_created": 1614814299, "timestamp_updated": 1614814299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863193929195404053", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14313645": {"recommendationid": "14313645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034462410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 15963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4272, "last_played": 1604350314}, "language": "english", "review": "Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\n\n\u201cWhat, you'd like to know my story?  There's not much to tell, I'm sorry to say. I came here, same reason as you \u2013 for glory, for gold. And not one man can fault me with cupidity, no. I tempted good friends, capable friends, spewing that very promise, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.\n\n\u201cLike pigs to the slaughter. \n\n\u201cThe first month was uneventful at the estate. Harried heroes came and went, but my friends and I were heartier fare. We spent what treasures we pilfered on libation, often causing a ruckus in the tavern. New adventurers would swagger in, cocksure, and we'd put them right in place. We'd usually frighten the greener ones off... the rest would perish, often crying out \u2013 for God, for their mother, for the sweet release of death. Fools. \n\n\u201cMy friends and I, we don't adventure anymore. We tend the estate, greet would-be heroes such as yourself, to give fair warning. All your skills, all your learning, all your experiences past mean nothing here. You will die, likely alone and raving in the dark. Death is all that you can count on. Death is all you will know. \n\n\u201cWhat, my necklace? No, these are no ordinary charms, child. These are my friends, you see. I carry them with me still, even after death. They quiet my mind, when the dark comes, you see. It was the least I could do; their bodies gave me sustenance \u2013 their bodies give me sustenance, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.\n\n\u201cAnd so will you.\u201d\n\nDarkest Dungeon is an RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler \u2013 and yes, I've written this phrase so much it autocorrects genres without prompting. I've named my dog \u201cRPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler\u201d and he hates me. But I digress. Story is that your wealthy relative has died, not before sending you a letter, urging you to come to the ancestral shit hole to spruce things up and purge the ancient, unknowable evil that lurks, broods, and taints up the place like an unruly teenager. The game starts off with a neat little tutorial, explaining some of the nuances of gameplay: tactical placement of characters, attacks, effects, etc. These are all standards we've come to know and love in the genre, nothing out of the ordinary. But there are a few twists that set Darkest Dungeon apart. \n\nWhen you set out on a journey you'll select your adventurers, and there are a lot to choose from. Some are tanks, some are roguish, some are healers, and some suck (stupid damn plague doctor I HATE YOU SO MUCH). You can select your character order as well, and right clicking on a portrait provides insight into their ideal placement. Different heroes provide different bonuses, like scouting ahead to spot traps and treasure. After you pick your team you'll need provisions, a risk and reward proposition...  are you detecting a pattern? You'll need food for characters, particularly on the longer treks (there's even a camping/survival mechanic to replenish health and stress for such undertakings), or they're liable to starve. You'll need torches  to light the way and keep characters from intermittently having nervous breakdowns. And you'll need various health items to keep bleed and blight effects in check. Does this sound like a lot to juggle? Because I am not doing the death-defying, chainsaw spinning, greased up, foot juggling spectacle justice, I assure you. There aren't enough words. After your quest these provisions don't carry on to the next journey, unfortunately. So do you risk spending too much, or spending too little? Both carry consequence. \n\nBut there's more.\n\nEvery hero and heroine has a stress bar beneath their health. With each enemy encounter, trap, and the act of WALKING, the adventurers will accrue stress. This is countered by killing blows, critical hits, and some support abilities. Inevitably someone will reach their breaking point after one too many knock knock jokes and one of two things will happen: they'll rally courageously, lowering their stress and everyone elses, or become afflicted. This affliction, whether it be cowardice, masochism, irrationality (and more!), means you won't always be in control of that hero, often to their detriment and the team's. \n\nAfter you clear (or flee) a dungeon you return to the estate, a hub where your weary adventurers can get some much needed R&R. Mirroring the core gameplay, your decisions in the hub world are deeply tactical. Some characters are religious, and will only be willing to visit the abbey to relieve stress. Others will happily drink and gamble their sorrows away. And as less savory quirks develop (buffs and debuffs gained through adventuring and R&R, separate from affliction), you can send them to the sanitarium, where presumably all the fun is. All of this is costly in time and money, and you'll have to manage carefully. Fresh heroes and heroines are wheeled into town after every adventure, but they are newbly in nature. With each subsequent successful quest, estate properties unlock, providing you the ability to upgrade abilities, armor and weapons, survivor traits, and more (you can upgrade your town's buildings to improve their respective output). Expect to spend a lot of booty.\n\nAfter enough victories more procedural dungeon locales unlock, bosses become available to fight, and the game gets tougher. I'm not joking when I suggest that YOU, the player, will experience every quirk, affliction, and solace your characters do. I was paranoid. I was stalwart. I was masochistic. I was even hagiophobic (the last time a game introduced me to such cool vocabulary was Eternal Darkness). That is an accomplishment. And it was all worth it, every second of crawling, creeping madness, to play this game.\n\nIt's only February 2015 and this will easily be a contender for GOTY, of that I have no doubt. The art direction is spectacular; beautiful and visceral at the same time, like an old, dusty, medieval anatomy book. The turn-based attacks are so cool, so varied. The enemies are bizarre, terrifying, and menacing. The heroes and heroines are flawed, heroic, almost real. The dungeon crawling is rewarding, the victories are often bittersweet, and the office cooler conversation potential of this game is off the charts with so many variables. But the narration, sweet tap dancing Allfather, Allmother, and every Allrelative in between, the narration is amazing. It's omnipresent, in the hub and dungeons, raising hopes and dashing them in dulcet tones. It's like Vincent Price and Paul Frees' (Disney's Haunted Mansion) voices got married and Cthulhu officiated. \n\nI have a few teeny, tiny criticisms. The game can be unrelentingly punishing at times, unfair even. And while there is no fail state per se, things can get so bad that you'll want to just restart. I'd like the option to play a game in which I can save. XCOM has a save mode AND  an Ironman mode, and I'd prefer that option here as well. There are also little technical glitches here and there, grammatical and spelling errors occasionally. That's about it. That's the sum of my complaints. I'd like to be able to save and there are a few little errors. And this title is in Early Access, which means we can anticipate lots of fine tuning and HOPEFULLY some cool additions as well. But what's already here, what's already been done, is spectacular.\n\nIt would be a grave crime against the Elder Gods to pass this up, and madness will surely follow.", "timestamp_created": 1422985955, "timestamp_updated": 1426589247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 516, "votes_funny": 211, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86098402738571167", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16200356": {"recommendationid": "16200356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005154483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 4025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1617740858}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine you're playing Dungeons and Dragons with H.P.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nDarkest Dungeon is a [b]grimdark[/b] dungeon crawling, side scrolling, mixed turn-based combat and real time adventure, rogue-like game developed and self-published by Red Hook Studios.\n\nThe game boasts several unique features, the most prominent of which is the Stress system which may cause your heroes to either panic or rally depending on the situation. If a hero panics, said hero may become 'afflicted' or become 'virtuous,' becoming either a liability or a benefit to your current expedition.\n\nThis game was made possible through crowd funding via Kickstarter, as well as Early Access.\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]\nThe player takes on the role of an unnamed 'Heir' of a powerful and wealthy family. After being called back to his ancestral home by an enigmatic figure known as 'The Ancestor' who awoken a sleeping evil within the depth of the family Manor, the Heir must now use what remains of the family fortune to gather a rag tag group of adventurers to explore, cleanse, reclaim, and rebuild his family's estate from the evil that now inhabits it.\n\n[i]\u201cWomen and men... soldiers and outlaws... fools and corpses. All will find their way to us now that the road is clear.\u201d - The Ancestor[/i]\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ [b]AMAZING[/b] grimdark 2D artstyle\n+ Very good narration and voice acting\n+ Very good sound design and music that matches with the game's theme\n+ Numerous and versatile classes \u2013 there is a certain joy in experimenting with different classes, parties and skill compositions\n+ Very good and unique gameplay mechanics such as:\n[list]\n[*] Torch and light levels that directly affects gameplay\n[*] Stress levels (Heroes can panic and become less effective if stress goes to high)\n[*] Quirk System (Adds certain positive or negative effects to your heroes)\n[/list]\n+ Skill customization for the heroes \u2013 this makes them relevant even with different party compositions and tactical situations\n+ Harsh but manageable difficulty levels \u2013 mandatory autosave and no reloads with permanent hero deaths\n+ Good overall presentation\n+ Good replayability\n+ Lengthy game time\n+ Interesting back story and lore\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Limited number of dungeons \u2013 to be fair, the dungeons are procedurally generated.\n- Sudden and unexpected difficulty spikes \u2013 specially when transitioning from Veteran to Champion\n- Limited visual customization for both town and heroes \u2013 [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/searchresults/?src_cat=12]mods[/url] are available if you want to change hero skins\n- Resources (other than gold) becomes irrelevant late game, specially once the town is fully upgraded\n- Limited number of trinkets (equipment and accessories)\n- Occational graphic glitch\n- One or two crashes here and there\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]\n+/- The back story and lore is nice, but the game's story itself boils down to \u201ckill the boss\u201d \u2013 you can skip all other bosses and the back story with it.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b]GREAT GAME[/b] for any dungeon crawler and turn-based tactics fan. Featuring a good back story backed up with amazing artstyle, Darkest Dungeon brings to the player the tactical challenge of XCOM, the grimdarkness of Dark Souls, and the joy of exploration of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, all in one package.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]\nI can easily [b]RECOMMEND Darkest Dungeon at its full price[/b] of $24.99 USD (or your regional equivalent). With good replayability from the unique classes and the relatively unpredictable combat results, the game can last you for at least 20 hours or more.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

Quite possibly.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.\nAn incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.\nPlaying as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of \"stress\" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.\n\nEach character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.\nEach character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.\n\nActions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid. \n\nI could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it. Though early access (at this moment), it's easily worth the purchase and will have you cursing for hours on end as your party members trudge through dungeons, are faced with insanity and eventually perish.\n\nBuy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1424867037, "timestamp_updated": 1424867037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846482157707214355", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76768107": {"recommendationid": "76768107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066375615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 7287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3645, "last_played": 1684392088}, "language": "english", "review": "I made the mistake of naming all my goons after my friends.

This game is so addictive to me and there are so many different kinds of runs that you can do that the game always feels fresh. Speaking of feeling fresh, there is no other game that I have felt as much of an emotional roller coaster while playing before. The way that your runs can suddenly take a dark twist at any time really makes everything pressure you into really trying to figure out what is the best possible move in any turn or at any time, even when making this move you are screaming at your screen. The more you play this game, the more lessons you learn, the more you learn about what is best and what enemies to focus down, and what trinkets to go fore. It is incredibly satisfying to do well in this game because of how much all odds feel to be against you at all times, as it is usually because you had chosen the best possible option for any scenario. Besides the gameplay, as I mentioned earlier, the atmosphere in this game is fantastic. Everything including the ambient noise, the music, and of course, the ancestor's narration, make this game's atmosphere just unlike any other game I have ever played. It truly put me at least, in the heroes' shoes.
