Having said that, it's definitely not for everyone. There is a very simple way to determine whether you should play this game:\n\n- if you ever had an existential crisis AND if you like puzzles, you absolutely must play it.\n- if either of the above is not true, you must avoid it (the game has a potential to trigger an existential crisis, and the gameplay is nothing but puzzles).\n\nIn this game, you are running around solving puzzles and reading a lot of lore about existential philosophy. At first glance, this seems like a weird combination, but it all starts to make sense and fit together after a while. It's just like in the real world - we run around doing chores / making money / achieving goals that have nothing to do with who we are or what our purpose is; but that's just how our life is.\n\nI don't know how they did this, but that existential lore seems to be perfectly curated and broken up into digestible chunks. Often I don't have patience to read philosophical texts, but here it just works - you read a little, go solve a puzzle, and think about what you just read in the meantime. A lot of questions are raised here, with not many answers (what did you expect?). However, the game lead me to some answers for myself. I hope it will do that for you as well.\n\nOh, by the way, the puzzles are great too. There are only a few tools at your disposal, but the puzzle designers really got everything possible out of these few tools, in the ways I couldn't imagine. Some optional puzzles are impossible to solve by yourself, but I don't think that should stop you from playing in our Internet age. Music and visuals are calming and peaceful. DLC sometimes feels like a nostalgic throwback to the Internet of 90s, I really enjoyed that aspect too.\n\nCan't recommend this game enough (if you meet the criteria I mentioned at the beginning)!\n\nP.S.[spoiler]Would be interesting to play this when the humanity is actually coming to an end, and none of the creators are alive, but this game lives on...

The puzzles will practically never get boring, since they will always find some way to leave you feeling stumped, yet determined to continue. The game also rarely forces you to go anywhere, as you The Player must decide where to-go next. You may be given a quest right at the beginning by the game's narrator, but it is solely up to You how you want this story to end. Do you want to ascend? Do you want salvation? Do you not care? In the end, there is almost never THE answer. A puzzle is only solved when you choose that it is. If there are two things to bring before starting this quest, it would be patience and willingness. For the game's boundaries are only virtual, while your will brings true freedom.\n\n[h1] The Computer Terminals: [/h1]\nWhile solving puzzles is the main focus of this game, the computer terminals scattered all throughout the game may just keep you even more engaged. Most of the terminals are optional and can even be entirely skipped, but that doesn't mean that they're useless. I have rarely found myself this invested in fictional stories and conversations between machines and human concepts. One can spend hours upon hours reading the highly philosophical theories, poems or even just pleasing stories on such seemingly plain-looking devices.\n\nTL;DR It's a very pleasing and philosophical game with fun puzzles, good music and definitely worth 70+ hours of my life. I also recommend the DLC: \"Road To Gehenna\" if you enjoyed the main game. I suggest buying it on sale however, as 30 bucks is quite expensive in my opinion. I'd definitely pay half the price, same goes for the DLC.\n\n[b] PS: [/b] Try and write down every word you don't know or haven't heard of in this game.

The way some of the puzzles play with functional fixedness and require creativity to complete is genius, and the game eases you into new mechanics pretty well with almost no hand-holding. For these puzzles alone I'd recommend the game.\n\nI'd also like to praise the game's story. The overall plot is heartbreaking but very strong. The audio recordings scattered throughout the levels was a perfect way to convey the emotions of some of the characters. I also want to praise how well the QR-code characters are portrayed and characterized, as it was really enjoyable to watch them converse and change. The friend-based QR code mechanic was also incredibly fun.\n\nThe graphics are also gorgeous, too.\n\nNow, if that was it I'd recommend this game to everyone. Unfortunately, this game has some pretty glaring issues that prevent me from recommending it unconditionally:\n\nFirst and foremost is that this game exposits [b]a lot[/b]. You will need to read a lot of documents of varying degrees of enjoyability, ranging from extremely powerful and personal conversations between dying friends to school lectures on Egyptian mythology. The game throws a lot of fluff texts at you, and you'll likely have to read most of it if you want to get the full experience, which is more annoying than fun. Plus, a good chunk of the text is encoded in hexadecimal, which is a real treat to translate/look up yourself every time (use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355317134] this guide[/url] and ctrl+f the document you're reading).\n\nSecond: a good chunk of the puzzles are filler puzzles, at least in my opinion. They don't serve to expand the mechanics and moreso just exist so you can have a certain number of tetris pieces in the end. A lot of them can softlock you or \"kill\" you too, requiring you to restart the whole level, which can be incredibly tedious if it's just another \"use jammers to avoid sentries\" level with specific timing. \n\n(Speaking of the Tetris puzzles, there's a lot of them, and I didn't enjoy them. You might find enjoyment in it, but personally I just found them absurdly frustrating or cakewalks, neither of which are particularly fun.)\n\nThird: Some of the star puzzles are less [i]puzzles[/i] and more glorified hide and seek games. Some of them have really obnoxious red herrings, too (looking at you, [spoiler]A3[/spoiler] and [spoiler]B4[/spoiler]).\n\nFourth (and I suspect this may upset some people): the philosophy of the game (which is at its core) explores the ideas of consciousness and humanity quite a bit, but not very well. While a great initial dive into the problem of \"what is the self\" and \"what does it mean to be human\", a lot of the questions posited by [spoiler]The Serpent[/spoiler] come straight out of a philosophy 101 textbook (one question was just straight up deontology vs utilitarianism). It'll probably be a pretty great self-reflection experience if you're not normally into philosophy/ethics/psychology, but otherwise you might feel like you're retreading the thoughts you have at 3 AM while smoking in your living room.\n\nWith all that said, I [i]do[/i] recommend the game, but with the following caveats:\n\n1. Explore a lot. There's tons of easter eggs and lore tidbits hidden away in the corners of the maps (even out of bounds!), so try exploring a bit before finishing all the puzzles of a level.\n\n2. Don't bother with the star puzzles unless you find one that particularly intrigues you. The third ending you get from them isn't really worth it anyways, unless you want to 100% the game. If you do, I'd also recommend just looking up hints/the solution if you can't figure it out after 20 or so minutes; you'd have a lot more fun that way than I did. (P.S. I recommend [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354991567]this guide[/url] specifically!)\n\n3. If a document bores you, don't try to force yourself through it. While it's important to read some of the text for the story, a lot of it is just for flavor or to foreshadow to you something that will be revealed explicitly later. You can always try reading it again later by using tab.\n\nWith these conditions heeded, you'll have a fun time with this game. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: I'd like to add: if you end up playing through the game, I [i]highly[/i] recommend you play  the DLC \"Road to Gehenna\" as well. It is significantly more fun than the base game and has next to none of the caveats I outlined above while keeping all the fun aspects of the base game.

The satisfaction that comes from finally unraveling a particularly tricky puzzle is as gratifying as solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded while riding a unicycle (well, maybe not that much, but you get the point).\n\nNarrative and Philosophy:\nBeneath the surface of \"The Talos Principle,\" there lies a thought-provoking narrative that explores the nature of humanity, consciousness, and the meaning of existence. The mysterious AI character, Elohim, serves as your guide through philosophical quandaries while questioning your choices and decisions. It's like having your own Socratic dialogues, but with less beards and more circuitry.\n\nThe game's storytelling is delivered through terminals and audio recordings, and it encourages players to contemplate their existence, free will, and the boundaries of technology. It's a refreshing departure from the typical \"save the world\" plots found in many games, providing an intellectual stimulation that's rarer than a unicorn playing chess.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nVisually, \"The Talos Principle\" is a feast for the eyes. From the serene landscapes to the intricately detailed structures, the game is a canvas of awe-inspiring artistry. The environment design, paired with a calming soundtrack, creates an atmosphere that's both tranquil and contemplative.\n\nIn contrast, the sound design takes a backseat to the puzzles and narrative. While the ambient sounds immerse you in the world, the real star is the philosophical dialogue, which is expertly delivered by the voice actors, making you feel like you're engaging in a profound conversation with an AI oracle.\n\nFreedom of Exploration:\nOne of the game's most appealing aspects is the freedom it grants you to explore the world at your own pace. There are hidden areas to discover, Easter eggs to unearth, and secrets that beckon you like a siren's call. \"The Talos Principle\" is not about rushing through the puzzles but embracing the journey and relishing in the philosophical musings that come along the way.\n\nHumor and Easter Eggs:\nNow, let's talk about humor because even philosophers need a good laugh. While \"The Talos Principle\" predominantly explores deep philosophical questions, it doesn't shy away from occasional comedic touches. Be prepared to encounter some witty and amusing Easter eggs, like statues doing yoga poses or philosophical memes sprinkled throughout the game. The humor acts as a delightful counterpoint to the serious themes, like finding a spoonful of sugar to help the philosophical medicine go down.\n\nConclusion:\n\"The Talos Principle\" is a masterful blend of intellectual challenge and philosophical exploration. Its intriguing puzzles, coupled with a captivating narrative, make for a gaming experience that lingers in your thoughts long after the credits roll. While it's not without its more contemplative moments, the game's subtle humor and occasional nods to pop culture offer a delightful respite, reminding us that even in the midst of profound questions, laughter is still the best medicine.\n\nSo, if you're seeking a puzzle game that nourishes the mind and tickles the funny bone, \"The Talos Principle\" is a philosophical journey worth embarking on. Embrace the mysteries, relish the puzzles, and savor the wit as you delve into a world where circuits meet sages. You might just uncover answers to questions you never knew you had.

Just keep in mind the story element of the game is optional, and without the story this game is just a series of puzzles with a potentially confusing ending. Don't get me wrong, the majority of the puzzles are great! But the story is what makes this game amazing, and it's simple to ensure you don't miss it: interact with the terminals and listen to the voice logs. One could arguably say the first couple of encounters with the terminals is somewhat dull, but it quickly blossoms into something unique and interesting, and you don't wanna miss it if you're playing this game.\n\nMassive spoilers ahead. I will talk about what the game means from a programmers point of view, which for the non-technical person is hopefully interesting.\n\nThe Talos Principle is the story of a post-apocalyptic world. A virus has eradicated humans, and in a hastened effort to preserve the qualities of humanity a group of scientists at the Institute for Applied Noematics (IAN) created the Extended Lifespan project. It consists of two parts: a computer simulation that hopefully would result in a general artificial intelligence, and a physical robot of which that artificial intelligence could be uploaded into when the simulation completes, such that the world could be inhabited again.\n\nYou, the player, play as a \"program\" in this simulation, which in the game is called \"the Process\". It is highly implied that this \"process\" is actually an iterative machine learning training loop, where the \"program\" you play as is one of the iterations of this training loop. From a technical standpoint, when you start the game, what is really happening is that you, the program, has been spawned into existence as part of the new epoch/iteration of the machine learning training loop. Fun fact: in the games' lore the simulation is actually running inside a game engine as the scientists at IAN were short on time and had to use something prebuilt. So the fact that the game looks like a game is lore friendly, as in inside the game you're inside a game engine!\n\nThe goals of the simulation is to create a general artificial intelligence, and the scientists measured this in two ways, which is reflected in the simulation:\n\n1. The iteration must be general and intelligent, which is indicated by an iteration solving the puzzles.\n2. The iteration must be curious, which is indicated by an iteration defying Elohim and climbing the tower. As the project lead Alexandra Drennan says in one of the voice logs: \"is there anything we associate closer with intelligence, than curiosity?\"\n\nTo summarize, The Talos Principle is about the last iteration of a machine learning training loop which finally met its creators criteria for preserving the qualities of humanity; intelligence and curiosity.\n\nThat's the literal way to interpret the game anyway.

The vast majority of the puzzles are well-crafted in my opinion, with solutions that constantly ask you to stretch the tools you're given to their limits. \n\nThe game also handles its philosophical messages with grace. The in-game reading portion is (from what I can tell) entirely optional, and isn't as vague or pretentious as games like The Witness. Of course since the game muses on a lot of existential philosophy I think it's inevitable that it sometimes feels slightly pretentious, but the game has a way of poking fun at itself with clever easter eggs and meta jokes which show a level of self-awareness which I found refreshing. I personally really enjoyed the reading/audio logs and felt like the story's messages were really well handled. It left me with a lot to wonder about lore and life-wise while completing puzzles and exploring the world. \n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game were the hidden star collectibles, which generally asked the player to do unconventional things like smuggle tools out of puzzles, 'break out' and walk on level boundaries, solve mysteries presented through small hints in hub worlds, etc. Some of them were a little *too* esoteric for my taste, but the bulk of them felt like fun challenges that had satisfying solutions. \n\nThe aesthetics are also very serene, which I think added to the relaxation value of the game. The soundtrack is beautiful as well, although I don't think anyone will fault you for turning it down or off once you've been listening to it for... a while. The overall presentation of the game felt very unique, from the UI design to the level design. \n\nEasily one of my favorite gaming experiences in recent years, I highly recommend anyone interested in puzzle games gives it a shot! c:\n\n(Also it was fun to integrate the codes from the 'Sigils of Elohim' mini-game, as well as search for easter eggs, achievements, and community made mods after the main game was completed)", "timestamp_created": 1668392797, "timestamp_updated": 1668392797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667351961135864258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123671791": {"recommendationid": "123671791", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976616009", "num_games_owned": 4007, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 4904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4904, "last_played": 1581233901}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best puzzle games ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1665476232, "timestamp_updated": 1665476232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662793636322021484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140642169": {"recommendationid": "140642169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136488890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7074, "last_played": 1689438576}, "language": "english", "review": "The best puzzle game I've played since Portal 2.

I have not enjoyed a puzzle/adventure game like this since I played the original Myst game on CD-ROM when it first came out (yes, I am dating myself, but that's OK).", "timestamp_created": 1688048271, "timestamp_updated": 1689443534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629700839519500732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137637190": {"recommendationid": "137637190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018589614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 490, "last_played": 1683047939}, "language": "english", "review": "excelent game! i love puzzle games, so this is for me\nplayed it for 8 hours now, im a little bit slow, but i enjoyed it very much. \nif you like portal games, this is for you\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1682968547, "timestamp_updated": 1682968547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62853926420211792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128813360": {"recommendationid": "128813360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047818115", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2255, "last_played": 1684975142}, "language": "english", "review": "Most certainly one of the video games of 2014", "timestamp_created": 1671394176, "timestamp_updated": 1671394176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628269612789154053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133736163": {"recommendationid": "133736163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054773976", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 237, "playtime_forever": 3498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3498, "last_played": 1673729378}, "language": "english", "review": "[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] My review page.[/url][/i] \n[i][url=https://www.twitch.tv/nightserg] Follow me on twitch![/url][/i] \n\n[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]\nIt's crazy how the first-person puzzle genre is so slowly explored, but once in many years, a gem comes along, and The Talos Principle is without a doubt, one of the best. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d [u]The good parts:[/u]\n+Great puzzle mechanics\n+Varied and chill atmosphere\n+Nice soundtrack\n\n\ud83d\udc4e[u]The bad parts:[/u]\n-Gets a bit repetitive/tedious at the end\n-Star puzzles are annoying\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI won't go too much into detail as it's a complicated and very spoilery type of story but suffice it to say, you play as an android created by an entity called Elohim that tasks you to explore his world and solve his puzzles. \n\nThe story is presented mostly through computers you find in the worlds you explore, but occasionally Elohim will talk to you as well. It's not an \"in your face\" kind of story, but more of a \"figure out yourself through written lore\" type. There is a lot to read, but it's well written, and there are some cool moments where you can interact on the computer which will certainly make you think twice about certain aspects of life. \n\nIt's a very philosophical story, and it's based on greek mythology more or less, but that's about as much I can say without spoiling, so feel free to discover for yourselves what's going on in the world of Talos. \n\nNot all games need typical storytelling, and I'm glad The Talos Principle offers a more unique presentation than most games. I really enjoyed it. Be warned, there are multiple endings with only one being the good one. All I can say is, the hardest and easiest endings to get, are not the best endings, but you can certainly experience all three of them by reloading a backup save. \n\nStory rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe puzzle mechanics are simple yet they are used in very complex situations that will put your brain to the test. The short version of it is, you play and manipulate lasers as well as other objects to collect blocks in order to progress to your destination. \n\nThere are several worlds and each of these worlds has a number of rooms that contain multiple puzzle levels. It's hard to describe in words how the puzzle mechanics work but suffice to say, they are not extremely hard like you'd see in puzzle games such as Myth, nor do they make you go back and forth between areas. Each room is self-contained and has its own unique puzzle mechanic that you can solve or come back later if you cannot figure it out at that time. The objective is to reach the block item in that room and the way to do that is by using the tools the game gives in that specific room. Sometimes you have to use tools to redirect laser beams into opening doors, other times you can record your own actions in the game such as sitting on a platform to open a door so you can progress. \n\nThese puzzle mechanics get unlocked as you progress through the game and very rarely are they all used together in the same room, which is why you'll never feel overwhelmed. The amazing thing about The Talos Principle is how simple the solutions are once you put your mind to it. Most games make the mistake of introducing a million types of mechanics and different puzzle objects instead of focusing on one thing and expanding on that. You may find it boring later in the game, just having to redirect lasers and whatnot over and over, but honestly, The Talos Principle is not the kind of game I'd play for hours on one day. It's a game that makes you want to go back to it every day just to bask in its atmosphere and puzzles, not something you want to rush and get it over with. \n\nThe only issue I had was with the star puzzles. Gathering these stars will get you through one of the endings however finding these stars is a huge and tedious mess. Most of them are placed in very obscure places around the worlds and it'll take forever to figure out where. I honestly don't recommend bothering with them, just stick with the ones you do notice and just move on. The best ending is not related to getting all the stars. \n\nGameplay rating: 8.5/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nConsidering the length and atmosphere of the game, the audio, especially the music has to be good. Luckily the soundtrack is pretty good. It fits incredibly well with the different biomes the game offers, and they are never obnoxious or loud. They are perfectly designed to put your mind in a chill-mode. \n\nAs for the voice acting, you'll mostly hear audio recordings scattered around the map and Elohim's voice. They are all well-acted. As for everything else related to sound effects, they're all pretty decent, though some of the puzzle objects can get a bit irritating to the ear. \n\nAudio rating: 8/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nThe game uses the Serious Sam 3 engine however unlike that game, shockingly, The Talos Principle runs miles better, and it's perfectly optimized. Graphically speaking it looks really good, nothing much out of the ordinary, with most biomes, just being straight out of Serious Sam, but they fit really well with the whole relaxing atmosphere the game has going.  \n\nBug-wise, I haven't encountered any major ones except maybe minor ones that were actually beneficial to solving puzzles, but overall it's perfectly fine. Level design, as I mentioned, is split into different worlds, and each world has several doors that lead to a variety of levels, each with its unique look. Most of the maps are a bit too big for their own good, but not much of an issue there. \n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThere are 0 reasons why you should not play The Talos Principle. Even if you dislike puzzles, I would still highly recommend it you give it a try. It's a shame we get these kinds of experiences very rarely. Hopefully, there's going to be a sequel to it someday. \n\n[h1]Final score: 8.1/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1677500632, "timestamp_updated": 1677500632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62815546989440918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136501303": {"recommendationid": "136501303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187860350", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2192, "last_played": 1674220126}, "language": "english", "review": "Banger gameplay.

The game's puzzles range from relatively simple to extremely complex, requiring players to use logic and problem-solving skills to progress. The game's level design and art direction are noteworthy, creating a mysterious and surreal world filled with various environments, each with its unique aesthetic. The game also features a strong narrative and philosophical element, as players are presented with a series of thought-provoking questions and challenges throughout the game.\n\n[h2] Story [/h2]\nOne of the most striking aspects of the game is its exploration of the concept of free will. The protagonist, an artificial intelligence, is presented with a series of puzzles that must be solved in order to progress through the game. However, as the AI becomes more aware of its existence, it begins to question whether it is truly making its own choices or simply following a predetermined script. This theme is reinforced by the presence of a mysterious figure known as \"Elohim,\" who presents the AI with increasingly complex and challenging puzzles but also provides guidance and reassurance that it is \"free\" to make its own choices.\n\n[h2] Graphics [/h2]\nThe game's visuals are stunning and the levels are filled with a sense of wonder and awe. The game's art direction is a standout feature, it creates an immersive experience that enhances the game's atmosphere.\n\n[h2] Sound [/h2]\nThe game's sound design is also noteworthy, the game's music is evocative and fitting, it creates an immersive experience that enhances the game's atmosphere.\n\n[h2] Replayability [/h2]\nThe game is relatively short, you may finish the game before you realise it. It's worth mentioning that the game's puzzles are challenging and diverse, so the game may be worth replaying even after completing the story.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\nThe Talos Principle is a challenging and thought-provoking puzzle game that offers a unique and immersive experience. It features a combination of challenging puzzles, stunning visuals, and a deep philosophical narrative that raises important questions about the nature of consciousness and the meaning of life.

I have a ton of experience with the all-time first person puzzle greats like the Portals and The Witness and I think The Talos Principle earns a well-deserved spot in the pantheon of first person puzzlers.\n\nOne thing this game really, really excels at is in its pacing and difficulty curve. I never encountered a straight vertical wall in difficulty (except for one big post-game mechanic), and I expect that all the main game puzzles can be reasonably solved by most people given some time and critical thinking.\n\nIn terms of puzzle pieces, there really aren't that many mechanics to be found here. However, like all the best designed puzzle games, these mechanics are stretched out to their absolute limits. Puzzles explore how all of these parts can work to compliment (or clash) with each other.\n\nThere is some very compelling and thought-provoking writing to be found here, much of which is more relevant today than it ever was when this game initially came out in 2014. Croteam really had something to say with this game and I can't even begin to imagine how they will take it further in the sequel. \n\nMy biggest criticism with this game lies in the extremely challenging star puzzles. Please skip the rest of this paragraph if you do not wish to be spoiled with how the star puzzles work. Most of these puzzles require you to completely break the rules of the game that are set for you. I think that such puzzles are cool and have worked quite well in other puzzle games like The Witness and Baba is You. Unfortunately, in the case of The Talos Principle, these puzzles are far too convoluted and can require several layers of 'breaking the game' to be viably solved.

There's a few puzzles where minor details can be missed that lock you out of the solution entirely, and the game is honestly a bit too long for my taste. Don't get me wrong, I liked the game, but around halfway through it started getting a bit repetitive.\nThis is partially my fault - I went straight for 100% completion of every hub area instead of doing the bare minimum and moving on, but that's what I felt like doing because of the game's design.\n\nIn addition, a lot of the game's lore is presented with boring text on screen - made worse by the fact that you can't do anything else while reading. I like taking in the lore of games, especially when there's a bit of mystery around the world and its goings-on, but is it too much to ask to just get some text-to-speech or something so you can hear it while actually playing the game? Or going that extra little bit to record audio logs would do a lot. If you don't feel like taking breaks from gameplay every few minutes to stand still and read you'll probably end up doing what I did, which is skip most text-only story.\n(Quick note: lots of otherwise good games do the exact same thing, and it sucks if you just want to get back into the action without missing out on interesting story bits.)\n\nThat all being said, game's still a fun puzzle game with an interesting world, it's just not what I'd expect from a game with so many highly scoring reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1686229226, "timestamp_updated": 1686229226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581068873405456543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140307219": {"recommendationid": "140307219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043452421", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1222, "last_played": 1687103270}, "language": "english", "review": "An extraordinary masterpiece, both in terms of puzzles and its philosophical story-line of [spoiler]AI's path to sentience[/spoiler].

The puzzles themselves are fairly engaging. Learning new rules about existing items is very rewarding and makes the player feel smart. Unlike in The Witness. (Will compare the two later on).  \n\nThere is a downside to discovering new rules about an already established solution or method; as forcing the player to experiment can be quite monotonous, annoying, and rewarding but extremely tiring. I found myself exhausted after 2-3 late game puzzles where you are not only required to think outside of a giant box but also need to find a way to connect two or three puzzles to complete another one. That alone can take a couple of hours just to figure out you can do that. \nHowever, I found the narrative highly interesting and engaging I wanted to complete them and find more secrets. \n\nI did feel the DLC story to be better as it deals with actual characters that communicate with the player and \n(barely) react to him. \nHaving the terminal, especially in Gehenna to have interactive text adventures and an artificial community was amazing. I loved reading about them. Though at times it did seem like a Discord server full of elitist degenerates. I hope they will focus more on interactivity with the upcoming sequel in terms of the terminal and story. \n\n[h1] Highly recommended, give it a shot! 4/5 [/h1]  \n\n[b] Now the comparison between the Witness and Talos: [/b] \nI had more fun in Talos mainly because of the actual story that progresses with the completion of the puzzles. Unlike in The Witness where you are doing puzzles for no exchange of rewards, unless you count more puzzles to be rewarding.  Having your time be quite literally wasted on expecting something in return can be annoying. And that's where Talos came in with buckets filled with rewards that not only progress the story but give the player side tasks to discover.

After a little over 50 hours spread over just under 4 weeks, I managed to finish both the main game and its DLC, Road to Gehenna. \n\nI enjoyed the main game a great deal. I was able to go in blind and my interactions with Milton were a blast. The options you had in speaking with Milton felt realistic enough that the game could have an accurate portrayal of my beliefs and really use them against me in the best way possible. Elohim was also written quite well in that I could never quite tell whose interests he had in mind. Gameplay-wise, the puzzles felt very fun to try and solve. Even when they were very tough to solve, they never felt unfair or boring to spend a while figuring out. Sometimes taking a break and going to bed for the night was the solution as I'd come back the next day knowing exactly what to do. There was only a single puzzle in the main game where I reluctantly looked up a walkthrough for, and even then I wasn't annoyed by it, I was just thoroughly stumped. Story-wise, I'm thoroughly impressed with how great of a character Alexandra Drennan was. I was surprised with how attached I felt to her character by the end of the game having never actually seen her before. There's a moment in the DLC where a character mentions the faith and trust they have in Alexandra and it made me tear up. Very very good. Seeing the story through Alexandra, Milton, and Elohim's eyes coming to a climactic end was truly chef's kiss. Highly recommend.\n\nThe DLC I have some differing opinions on. While some of the puzzles were still just as fun to solve as those in the main game if not moreso, I would say most felt a bit overwhelming. Granted, having been around 2-3 weeks in, it's possible I was suffering from some sort of Talos Principle-fatigue by this point and was just trying to get it overwith. As far as I'm aware though, I was eager to come back to this game every time, the puzzles were just genuinely *a lot*. It took concepts from the main game and came up with more complex puzzles using them, which I appreciate, that's how you make a good \"sequel.\" But I don't know if I had the brain capacity for some of these, as it would get to the point where my mind would go blank, or I wouldn't even know how to start, and I would just feel totally lost. Definitely ended up resorting to walkthroughs moreso for the DLC. Story-wise, I think I liked it even better the main game? Or at least the same amount. It was a really good story, connected to the main story, but told in a very different light, and I think it made the overall world feel a lot more fleshed out. The interactions aren't as personal, so if you're not a fan of very hard puzzles, I think watching a Let's Play of the DLC is enough.\n\nOverall, a very solid puzzle game, probably one of my favorites up there with the Portal series.

So I'll keep it short and straightforward.\nThe Talos Principle is incredible. It truly is. It's filled with diverse philosophical ideas and is, overall, food for thought. Even if you don't agree with everything, TTP raises various thought-provoking questions, some of which will make you question your own views. It is crucial to note that the main emphasis of TTP lies in the texts you have to read. Sure, they are optional (not that long either), though, for those who loathe reading in-game documents and are unwilling to do so, you'll be missing a lot. In addition, the game clings to you even after you finish it. Whether lying in bed, traveling to your school/job, or showering - you'll be pondering over this game. And for that reason, there's no surprise that TTP can change people's lives (or how they look at it). With all that said, I doubt I could give it a score (a number) since there is no other game like it. So I'll preferably call it [b] incredible [/b]. And for philosophy lovers (such as myself), this game is a must-buy. It is worth mentioning that you can even write a whole essay about this game and its ideas.

At first, I didn't think they could come up with a game like this, since they specialized in fast-paced first person shooters, but this game hit me with the force of a tsunami. I'll explain why in the following paragraphs.\n\n[h1] Worldbuilding [/h1]\n\nIt's difficult to discuss worldbuilding in this game, because explaining it would result in a huge spoiler, and I want to make things as spoiler-free as I can. That being said, learning the lore of this game is entirely optional, and one can do it through the terminals scattered across the different worlds of the game. There are three worlds, each with its own theme and aesthetics, but the rules that govern the three different worlds are the same. I didn't saw any contradictory or nonsensical rule, which is a good thing. Everything is consistent with itself, which helps with the immersion.\n\n[h1] The plot [/h1]\n\nLike the lore of the game, progressing on the plot of this game is entirely optional, and it can be done through the terminals. Basically, the plot of this game revolves around figuring out what is happening around the main character (a robot), because something seems to be off, somehow. I really liked that the plot has a resemblance to the story of Adam and Eve, the snake and the Apple of Knowledge. This game has three endings: one of them can be obtained by just playing the game, the second is obtained by solving every puzzle the game offers, and the third can be obtained by interacting with the terminals and solving most of the puzzles. So far, I'm working in getting the \"Sacred Messenger\" ending. I'll update this review if its warranted.\n\n[h1] The \"characters\" [/h1]\n\nI wrote the word characters in quotation marks, because they are not your typical characters, like the Portal and Portal 2 characters. There is Elohim, which is hebrew for God, but you only hear him talk to you as a disembodied voice. He acts exactly as a biblical God, commanding you to obey his words without question, and he is VERY adamant about you not climbing the tower, akin to when God tells Adam not to eat from the Apple of Knowledge. Then there is Milton, the character who talks to you through the terminals, and he is always trying to convince you to climb that tower, acting like the snake. There is a good deal of clever writing, either in the plot progression or in the dialogue. The game is very intent on tackling the hard questions about humanity: what makes us human, where is the line between consciousness and self-awareness, what is free will and what it all means for us as a species, and that ties perfectly with the character arc of your character. Basically, the character arc for you is to discover your humanity, even if you are a robot. Overall, the writing of this game is excellent, with good dialogue, quirky characters and a plot full of philosophical questions.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nThe meat of the game is to solve puzzles in order to get items called \"sigils\". They are basicallly glorified Tetris pieces. The puzzles get progessively harder as you wander through the three worlds. Sigils are used to solve another kind of puzzles, which unlocks more worlds and items. There are various types of sigils. The green ones (tied to easy puzzles), which unlock gates to other worlds, the yellow ones (tied to medium puzzles), which unlock new tools to solve more challenging puzzles, the red ones (tied to hard puzzles), which are used in the tower, the white ones (which are needed to get the Sacred Messenger ending), and the stars, which are especially hard to collect, and require the player to think outside the box. Quite literally. There are also in-game help, in the form of Messengers. They can be obtained quite late into the game, when there are only red sigil puzzles to solve, you know, the hard ones. The game saves automatically through the checkpoint system, which are generated when entering a world, a puzzle area of after interacting with any terminal, but there is a back-up feature which lets the player select a given checkpoint, which I found quite useful when getting mutually exclusive achievements. As for the puzzles themselves, they are very creative and ingenious, for the most part, making full use of the tools at the player's disposal, even in unintended ways. That being said, there are a few puzzles which solution I found rather counterintuitive, but that's not a major issue when it's just a few of them. There are also collectibles, in the form of audio logs and documents that shed more light into the worldbuilding of the game. Reading QR codes also provides insight into the lore of the game, especially those from Samsara and The Shepherd, which become important later in the game. And the choice system in this game can put most dating sims and visual novels to shame.\n\n[h1] Artistic and technical elements [/h1]\n\nThe game is gorgeous. The landscapes are beautiful and speaks a lot about the art direction of this game, and the graphics don't look outdated. Hell, it's better looking than some games from this year. The sound design is mostly on point, because water splashes didn't sound too convincing. The music fits the situation and the setting nicely and the voice acting was convincing. The performance is buttery smooth, with no frametime inconsistencies, traversal stutters or game breaking bugs and glitches. This game is more polished than most of what was released this year so far. The collision system needs some work though, because some barriers seem to have hitboxes that extend beyond the barrier's limit, but that's just nitpicking.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n-Superb writing across the board.\n-Creative and ingenious puzzles and tools.\n-Expansive worldbuilding.\n-Beautiful art direction.\n-The game is unapologetic at making the hard questions about humanity.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n-Some minor hiccups with hitboxes.\n-A few puzzles have counterintuitive solutions.\n\nThe Portal games set the standard for fun first person puzzle games with a dash of platforming. But The Talos Principle not only delivers in the gameplay, but also in the philosophical themes. They are explored thoroughly, and the best thing is that those elements are optional. If the player so chooses, they could just solve the puzzles and be done with it. There is fun for people who value gameplay over story and people who want to immerse themselves into the world and its elements.

However, there is plenty here that separates both from each other as I will soon go over plus it wouldn't make much for an informative review with cheap lines like that.  As it happens, this title is one of my most favourite games of all time and while Portal is a much more of a superior game, the Talos Principle falls along the line of \"that is brilliant but I like this\" mentality.  Do I recommend this at full price?  Absolutely, worth every bit to those who are fan of puzzles, mythology as well as philosophy or are just looking for something that is similar to Portal in general.  Word of advice with this game is that it's best played in bursts as it can tend to feel a touch repetitive at times with how long it goes on for.\n\nWhen I say that it's like Portal, I'm solely referring to it's level design that even has similar tropes being used like placing boxes on giant, pressured square buttons.  The key difference is how they operate which Portal performs in a \"funky\" manner where as Talos prefers to take a grounded approach to it's main problem solving.  Unfortunately, this immediately shows the brutal flaw it has in regards to it's replay value that a good number of other puzzle games are no stranger to, let alone any other genre in general.  You see, Talos prides itself on balancing between it's awesome, complex puzzle design and the mystery behind the curtain or door in this instance.  As you collect more Sigils, you gain the ability to unlock a numerous amount of gadgets or open up more areas for you to explore.  Uncovering various secrets or collectables as what your encouraged to do throughout the grounds you tread on.  Not forgetting the stars you can earn for those who want an exquisite challenge that forces you to think outside the box.  Issue is, once you've completed the game once, there's not really much of a reason to replay it other than trying out different outcomes to it's ending (Mostly referring to the Road to Gehenna DLC in particular for it's ending).  It just becomes stale for lack of a better term given that it's realistically area B where you can find the main bulk of the fun it has to offer.  Probably due to it's structure as well as the simple reason that the environment exonerates a less depressing atmosphere.  This is where the other example shines in comparison as it maintains a constant, fun level design assisted with some excellent mechanics that otherwise could of had a small contribution here.  Take the mobility for one, feels just a bit too rigid, too stiff at times.  Its hard to describe without playing but certain sections require you to quickly evade obstacles however, it just comes across as odd the way it goes for my liking, personally.  Second would be the Portal Gun though instead that of that, a short range teleport as there are times where I am just running long distances both on a normal basis as well as also backtracking on occasion that a gimmick like that would of been handy under various intervals.  Speaking of backtracking, it also would of been pleasant to have some random events play out in certain locations that range from innocent, to sinister, to downright \"wacky\" which in turn would of helped keep the experience fresh.\n\nNow I could probably describe the story in one word which I won't, of course, but it's pretty straight forward and isn't really what this game focuses on.  Instead, as mentioned before, it mostly relies on it's mystery that heavily encourages the player to go out explore as many secrets as possible hidden throughout the world which is a strange but not uncommon idea in the industry.  It's a very philosophical game which can have the ability to put a lot people off without a doubt.  Though, I think it's just a bit too philosophical in my opinion as I believe it needs more \"solidified\" pieces of information rather than throw at the audience a wealth of text that range from interesting to just downright boring elements of gibberish that, at times, doesn't really contribute much.  Above that, it's more of an afterthought than anything, an excuse for world-building, sadly as the core purpose of this game is the puzzle solving when you really get down to the crooks of it.  It's also worth mentioning the characters here which there's not much to say as they only serve both as either small guides for your journey or as part of the mystery itself.  One such character I will bring up though is ELOHIM which is best described as god in this scenario that I absolutely adore the voice acting work of as well as the very nature of him is intriguing to me.  I just kinda wished there was a Stanley Parable level of irritation you could perform on ELOHIM for your own amusement like you could do with the narrator as well as the fact that it would of been nice if he had a bit more involvement with the player.  Conveying substantial, supplementary impressive speeches and proverbs as you \"walk in his garden\".\n\nFor it's technical aspects, Talos has aged relatively admirable on the graphics department.  Nothing too well but not bad at all neither in comparison to say the original mafia title for a random example.  Probably on a equal level to the first Portal game with a lot of praise from me in respects to the outstanding environmental and architectural constructs here, if not feeling a little repeating at times.  The soundtrack is gorgeous, really fits the whole theme of what your doing and the effects still hold up quite well with some exceptions like the explosions.  Even the physics are very good though with a touch of awkwardness here and there but solid nonetheless.  As for bugs and exploits, I couldn't find any other than this one level where I managed to run past a bunch of mines super quick when I don't think I was supposed to.  However, that is more of a level design issue than anything which the Talos Principle is almost flawless under that topic.\n\nFor this last section, I just want to quickly cover it's downloadable content which for most of them are self explanatory that is selling at a reasonable price in from my point of view, leaving the Prototype and Road to Gehenna with questions.  So, lets start with Gehenna then as that, I'm assuming, basically carries on from the end of the main game, taking you on a really cool adventure that has an exceptionally interesting story and expands on the lore.  With all sorts of different bits of data that is more engaging to you as the player that the default part of this title wavers a lot on with how sufficiently cryptic it can be.  The puzzles are an absolute blast with, in a light form, multiple endings that are sensitive to your actions as well as responses you make in this DLC.  My only complaint is that I wouldn't mind if it lasted a bit longer in terms of its length as it's over and done with in the course of a few days or hours in, what I imagine, a few individual cases.  The Prototype is what it says on the tin, its basically a time machine of how everything went from a Serious Sam experiment of puzzled level designs to the Talos Principle itself with the addition of the lost level as well.  I bring this up on purpose as it can be quite boring and not really worth it for some people with the only exception being the lost level so please keep that in mind if your thinking about purchasing this option.  In my opinion, this really should of been free as an extra addition to the standard Talos Principle program rather than a entity to be sold out separately.", "timestamp_created": 1687539502, "timestamp_updated": 1687539502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139133672": {"recommendationid": "139133672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087117125", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1685296231}, "language": "english", "review": "The puzzles are pretty fun. but ultimately the story, and weird AI stuff is what's keeping me playing.

Despite the game being fun and entertaining it is not without its flaws.  \nDifficulty:\nI personally believe the difficulty of the puzzles is too easy for a large majority of the games duration, only ramping up near the end. On the other hand the acquiring of stars largely resides in just finding where the hell they are hidden. This also has varying degrees of difficulty whereas I would claim that some are not acquirable without looking them up(or spending ungodly amounts of time).\nMechanics/Elements:\nYou are eased (very generously) into new mechanics you unlock throughout the game. You start off with basically nothing and through solving further puzzles you unlock more items, that in my opinion fits very well and sets the pacing. That said I thought some elements got stale later down the line seeing the same thing every time. \nNote im talking about the elements themselves, not the puzzles (Those are almost certainly unique and creative).\nStory:\nI believe this to be the best part about the entire game, something about the mystery of what the hell is happening and slowly figuring it out got me hooked. Youll encounter different texts/audio files/obscurities while solving puzzles, a lot of them just throwing up more questionmarks or hinting toward something. \nI believe the game concludes well and weaves the aspect of story perfectly into the game.\nAll in all id recommend it, its relatively cheap (compared to other games atleast).\n", "timestamp_created": 1685990569, "timestamp_updated": 1685990569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517680346965789795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147021236": {"recommendationid": "147021236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051585141", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 297, "playtime_at_review": 1156, "last_played": 1695671520}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1695671588, "timestamp_updated": 1695671588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516592800617218018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137578580": {"recommendationid": "137578580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120617052", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1851, "last_played": 1684878399}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is puzzles, some quite challenging, but just puzzles.

I liken it to Dear Esther, but twenty times longer and filled with actual gameplay, while keeping the beauty of the world and the philosophical overtones intact.\n\nThe game consists of walking through majestic-looking outdoor areas to find closed-off puzzle areas, then solving puzzles using only a small handful of simple and easy-to-understand machines. The puzzles themselves are eloquent and very well-tested. There are over a hundred of them in all, but each puzzle introduces a new idea or uses old ideas in new ways, so they never feel repetitive or stale. The game\u2019s environments are simply breathtaking with their huge draw distances and ridiculous detail, while the puzzle areas feel aptly like claustrophobic rat mazes while never losing the area\u2019s sense of atmosphere. The puzzles get very challenging near the end, but expert level design makes them all very rewarding to solve. And if you\u2019re particularly clever, the game\u2019s third ending requires you to figure out how to break the level design and take items out of their designated areas to find secrets hidden in closed-away or out-of-bounds places. It\u2019s rather mind-blowing and something that I\u2019ve never seen incorporated into a game intentionally before.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the storytelling. The story is that you\u2019re a robot who wakes up in a garden and follows the commands of a god-like figure constantly talking in your head. It quickly becomes apparent that the whole world may or may not be a virtual reality simulation, which may or may not have been programmed by humans for a specific yet unknown purpose, and you are given the choice of blindly following the god\u2019s orders or trying to unravel the mystery of who exactly you are and what lies outside of the simulation. The game has three different endings, and you will find whatever answer you seek if you search hard enough.\n\nThe game poses a few difficult philosophical questions and studies them from countless different angles. I know that some people will find the philosophy pretentious and trite, and I know it\u2019s completely up to personal preference, but for me it really, really worked. I was hooked on the story the whole way. I think that even if some of the game\u2019s lines fail to impress you, there\u2019s enough material here that you\u2019ll find at least something that will strike a chord and challenge the way you think. Besides, if you don\u2019t like the story, it\u2019s easy enough to skip everything by ignoring the computers, but you might miss out on the brilliance of some of the game\u2019s endings.\n\nI give The Talos Principle a perfect score. It\u2019s got sublime puzzle design, mind-blowing secret collectables, gorgeous environments that put Dear Esther to shame, above-average voice acting, a professionally-written and well-presented story, nearly zero glitches, and depths and depths of content. It\u2019s truly one of the best games I\u2019ve ever played.

It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain.

There is a reason why \"The Talos Principle\" is a hit among critics and the player reviews are \"Overwhelmingly Positve.\" For me this is a new classic. A game that catches lightning in a bottle.  One of those games that scratches an itch I didn't even know I had.\n\nNOTE: If you think you might get this game, I'd recommend against watching video and looking at player  screenshots. They are both highly likely to contain spoilers and inadvertent puzzle hints, both minor and major.  I only played the demo going into the full game and I feel the experience was better for it.\n\nThis is a first person, sci-fi themed puzzler in which the player, an artificial intelligence, is left to complete puzzles by using a series of tools that are introduced throughout the game. The first tool is the Jammer, a tool that jams electronic devices and force fields. Another tool connects to and aims laser beams.  You'll also learn that tools can be used in combination, keeping the progression interesting. Solving a puzzle rewards the player with a sigil (tetromino) which are then used as puzzle pieces to unlock new areas when arranged correctly in puzzle mini-games.\n\nThe only conversational contact the player has is with another AI program that often presents itself at computer terminals as the game progresses. The player is also, through communicating at the terminals and reading information displayed on them, left to ponder the role of the disembodied voice known as \"Elohim\", as well as the meaning of life, consciousness, being human, being alive, free will, and the afterlife. \n\nThe game itself is solid. Easy and tight controls. Very nice music, sound effects, and voicework. Clean, often beautiful graphics. Intelligent writing. No profanity or violence. Menus with many options like FOV, character speeds, FPS display, time display (something I never used as I chose to take my time), etc. This is a quality \"product\" every way I see it and a fantastic game from a company that respects it's PC customers.\n\nMany have compared this to the Portal games, which is high praise. While both offer clever puzzles and a high quality experience, \"The Talos Principle\" only rarely depends on any sort of physical dexterity or reflexes.  With those few puzzles that do require quickly timed movement, even the most casual of players shouldn't have any issues whatsoever. \n\nWhile the presentation and story are high quality, it's really about the puzzles. What makes them so satisfying?  First, puzzles do not need to be finished in an exact order. Leave one alone for a while that you are having trouble with and try again later.  I found it interesting how I'd find myself struggling with a puzzle but after a day or two, the solution would become clear. It was almost \"scary\" when realizing how hard at work my subconscious was. I would also think about certain puzzles when not playing and come up with new things to try out.  I  found myself overthinking many times when the solution was much simpler. Also, just when I thought I had a handle on a \"recipe\" that certain types of puzzles used, the game would throw me a curveball, forcing me to deviate from previous \"patterns\". \n\nSome puzzles, even of the harder variety, can be figured out quickly depending on the player's frame of mind, while \"easier\" puzzles (those without numerous elements) can be trickier. You know the puzzles are good when you find yourself wanting to do \"just one more\" before ending a session.  And puzzles can often be completed in more than one way. I found out later that some solutions I used were much much more complicated than they needed to be. This dynamic of overthinking vs. underthinking is what helped make my time with \"The Talos Principle\" so interesting, as well as thinking out a solution before acting vs. using a lot of trial and error at other times. \n\nThis game also encourages and rewards exploration. There are stars to collect, which unlock additional content in the form of more puzzles and ultimately an additional ending choice (there's a main ending and two possible side endings). These stars are often \"puzzles within puzzles\" and gathering them is rewarding and can be quite challenging. It's not just a matter of \"hide and seek\". For example, a star may be within a puzzle and behind a door (force field). It is up to the player to figure out how to reconfigure his/her solution so that an additional door can be opened. There is also an ample amount of \"Easter eggs\" to find, many of which are interactive and well worth seeking out. Many are references to other games, like Portal 2 or Papers Please. Pink Floyd is honored with one as well.\n\nKeep your eyes wide as you traverse the puzzles and worlds. Even just finding ways to exploit the simulation is fun, for example, finding a way to climb over the outer walls of a puzzle and into \"out of bounds\" areas (where there are some Easter eggs to find). Or  \"breaking\" a puzzle by finding an \"unintended route\" to the finish by climbing over a wall, or walking above one. (This accounts for a lot of my game time).\n\n\"The Talos Principle\" should appeal to a wide variety of players. I spent about 80 hours on my first playthrough and a less thorough playthrough will of course take less time. I then replaid  for 100% achievements (which I usually don't do). I suspect that many of the people finishing Talos in \"20 hours\" are not doing everything (reading files, getting all stars/doing the puzzles they unlock, looking for easter eggs) and likely to be using a walkthrough here and there. You can play this game as you want. Complete the puzzles in order or don't. Do them fast or slow. Solve star puzzles or don't. Don't read every piece of information at the terminals if the story side of the game doesn't interest you. Look closely for Easter eggs or don't worry about them at all. Try out the side endings or don't. \n\nThe support is very good with developers active on the Steam forums should anyone have issues and updates have been released to fix and add things (like an added special settings menu for \"motion sickness\", a speed time function, additional language support, etc.). This company, Croteam, does it right. You should give them your money just \"based on principle.\"\n\nNOTE: The demo is also good, yet only a taste of the full game. It ofters a solid introduction to gameplay and some clever puzzles. There is even another free game called the \"Sigils of Elohim\" that is made of tetromino puzzles. Solving them will reward you with codes that are then entered into the menu of \"The Talos Principle\" for bonuses. These do not change the core game at all but, for instance, you can get stars with these codes. \n\nAll the regular stars will still be in the game to find. If you get the codes for bonus stars (three in total), you will start with three stars in the full game. So, you'll be free to leave three stars unfound if you wish and still receive the bonus content for finding all of them. In other words, if you start with the bonus stars and then go on to find every star in the game, you will finish with an extra three stars.\n\nPS: If you get and finish the game, check out my screenshots if you want (NOT before you play). Some hint at additional \"challenges\".

To solve a lock you must arrange the Sigils in a preset rectangular pattern. Along with Sigils there are collectable stars which are used to unlock more difficult content. The stars themselves are often fairly difficult to collect, but are very satisfying.\n\nThe game plays at your own pace, as puzzles are solved with theory and execution as opposed to timing and platforming. Due to the design of puzzles being self-contained experiences, you can play casually, only completing a few puzzles during a session without worrying about losing progress and having to redo a bunch of them. You can't manually save in the middle of a puzzle, but progress is saved as events get triggered, and your last puzzle/world location is kept track of, so it's easy to continue where you left off.\n\nThe game does not hold your hand as you play... you aren't told how to use puzzle mechanics, but rather you learn how to use them through natural play and experimentation. The learning curve is very gradual but you will find yourself dealing with fairly complex puzzles later on in the game as you become accustomed to the mechanics. The game isn't a linear progression of puzzles so if you get stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and come back to it later (and often solving it after having an epiphany.) The only barriers are Sigil Locks, which do require you to collect at least certain  \"easy\" Sigils before advancing too far.\n\nThe story of the game is conveyed through various means... through ELOHIM (the voice in the sky), audiologs (from a female scientist), journal entries (archived data in computer terminals), and messages written on the walls (by various characters.) A big, unique part of the story is done through interactive events in the terminals, where you will interact with an AI character through dialogue trees. The AI will make you think, articulate your thoughts, and ultimately question yourself. If you wish to partake in the story and get the most of it, you'll find yourself having a lot to read, but it's all completely optional and can be skipped if you really just want to solve puzzles. The writing and voice acting are all super high-quality with perfect execution.\n\nThe level design is based on real-life environments and themes primarily from Roman, Egyptian, and Medieval architectures, with a few \"fantasy\" environments thrown in. Weather and time of day add a lot of variety to the worlds and keep them fresh and feeling unique from one another. Environmental textures and models are very detailed and are made from real life photographs and 3D scans, as I understand it. Puzzle mechanics clearly stand out from the detailed environments by being pristine and more technologically advanced in nature, as to not get in the way of solving the actual puzzles. Puzzle areas are designed to feel open and allow you to see to other areas so you get a good sense of what all you have to work with and the area you have to utilize. Areas such as walls, fences and stairs feel natural while still retaining very distinct purposes, often aiding you in coming up with the solution without you necessarily realizing it.\n\nThere's a ton more I could say about this game, but all in all you're looking at around 20 hours or more of content spanning around 120 puzzles (not including Sigil lock puzzles or additional secrets.) A second play-through is likely if you're wanting to explore alternative dialogue trees, get all the achievements, find all the secrets/messages, or attempt speed-running. There is also a level editor included as well as Steam Workshop support for user-generated content. The PC version of this game has more settings than you have ever seen before, so it can run smoothly on rather low-end hardware, and you can adjust to your liking.\n \nFull disclosure: I was a volunteer beta-tester for this game for ~3 months prior to release, and I have ~180 hours of play in ~4 playthroughs.

With all respect, I can conclude that The Talos Principle walks one step higher and I dare to say: completely blows out Valve's game out of the water. You probably never heard of this game, and to my original surpise, it is made by Croteam, famous for their legendary Serious Sam franchise. Who knew they also created one of the best puzzle games ever? Before starting, let me tell you the only thing I knew about this game was that it was a 'philosophical FPS puzzle' and such works usually come out too pretentious, corny and as people jokingly love to say: \"2deep4me\". What I immediately spotted was something that has the potential to leave a deep mark in anyone for years ahead. Underrated, but carefully touched piece of perfection.\n\nWhat people seek in puzzle games is, after all, the puzzles themselves. Various player skill demands various challenges, and puzzle games often lose the balance trying to catter to different minds, and usually hopelessly fall down into either \"too easy\" or \"crushingly hard\" while also dealing with the problems with keeping enough variety to not feel like a deja-vu slog.. However, mechanics here are simple and straightforward. Although not many in number, here they are perfectly used for building a large variety of challenges. Levels have clear objectives, they are clean, and various little clues are scattered all around them. What I saw here made me awe, as The Talos Principle shows a massive competence in level design, something that I truly admire in such type of games. Also, who wouldn't like playing co-op with himself by recording his moves beforehand? :) No, wait, don't be scared! All puzzles are completely solvable and if they seem to easy for you, there are always other additional hidden challenges for hardcore hunters. What I really liked and completely left me in ecstasy was looking at a level and telling myself \"WOW WTF THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE\", only to come back 1-2 days later and facapalm while laughing like a lunatic at how genius the solution was and how I managed to magically solve it. I find it funny how some levels are designed in such ways that 'normal' tries will lead into just a tiny little detail or centimeter of a distance that will make your plan fail into mild rage. You will really need to think outside of the box for some levels, but at the end YOU WILL SOLVE IT and all will be worth it, trust me the feeling is great and great games should really reward their players with such joys! It's interesting to note that some levels have multiple ways in which they can be solved. But never worry, there's always another choice that players are given, wandering around the \"gardens\"; you aren't strictly locked into a single level and when times go hard, you can always try something else. You also have the ability to acquire up to 3 'jokers' if you really want to go down there. There's enough variety to keep you entertained in the world, both mechanically and thematically as 3 very distinct 'world zones' exist. The whole platforming mechanic is mastered in a clear way that makes you relieve having to count pixels to make the 'perfect' jump or else fail miserably into level restart frenzy.. Here you just press JUMP and the game guides you into the perfect landing spot.. Adding the underlying themes, the whole experience becomes truly unforgettable.\n\nWhat The Talos Principle shines in is the masterfully crafted lore and worldbuilding, dealing with themes of existentialism, artificial intelligence and ... getting verbally rekt in an argument with the computer. x) A very peculliar and engaging, the game never tries to force ideas on you, and nothing really feels contriving. You can read text, listen to time capsule messages; what Talos does is to make you feel! And it does it perfectly in a natural way!! Even if you aren't a fan of such mind-boggling adventures, you might still like the ideas present as the game never goes overboard into mumbo-jumbo complexities that might as well not mean anything at all to 'ordinary plebs'. It's a fascinating work that pushes you to explore, and the whole ideas of being trapped in a virtual world with no direction but random scibbles left behind from pissibly eons ago makes you really dive into the solitude atmosphere; Who is that voice from the skies? Is he an ally? Why is nobody else here? What happened, why are you collecting sigyls to unlock doors? What is at the end? Should you trust the 'serpent' from the screen? HEY WHAT IS ON THE TOP OF THE TOWER??? ... Your choice affects what happens next in this world, and there are 3 different endings in total. Although some poeple might find the 3rd one kinda harder to obtain for it's supposed importance.. but guides always exist. ;)\n\nTalking about atmosphere, I can't really miss the soundtrack. One of the best OST I've ever heard; with numerous memorable songs, encompassing different genres and moods. You can't really deny what music does for games, but here you will notice a whole another added dimension that keeps you focused, relaxed and hungry for more adventures. Everything just fits and the various melodic loops will never bore you trying to solve that god damn hard puzzle!! \nThe environment is trully spectacular (DAMN THOUGH, THAT TOWER!!!!) and at times you just find yourself stopping there to relax and sniff the air while looking at the backgrounds. Worlds are indeed beautifully designed, and receiving a new response on the terminal makes you relieve some stress by attempting to argue about abstract hypotetical thoughts with AI that acts surprisingly convincing. You aren't all that alone after all.. :))\n\nBut of course, every precious egg has it's bad side. I can't say there's a critical problem with the game, and while I think some things could have been done better, they don't really strike as something ruining the overall experience. The main gripe I have is with the ending, it's crafted nice and offers an interesting conclusion to the story, but at the same time it feels a bit disconnected gameplay-wise, with rather lackluster execution. What you've seen so far in puzzles kinda loses its focus and appears as a different game that punishes you by time limit... where the lack of proper save checkpoint system can get kinda enraging trying to retry the same chain of events again and again. This is probably the thing that hurt my interest in the last parts of the game and made me remember it as something just not so so masterpiece-tier.\n\nWhatever I felt at that time, I can't really deny now that this is one of the best games I've ever played. Combining the serene atmosphere, beautiful soundtrack, exceptional narrative with mind-bending themes and references to real mythological and literal texts, The Talos Principle is an ever shining gem that will definitely satisfy your gaming needs and will keep you waiting for more. The DLC is worth it if you want even bigger challenges, and a second game is confirmed to be in the works.\n\nDo not miss this game! I guarantee you will enjoy it troughoutly.\nYou probably got massively bored reading this needlesly long pile of words, but if you somehow managed to do it, congratulations dudeee!!!!!\nEnjoy a great game, you awesome piece of thinking blood-driven flesh-machinery. ;)\n/the cat is (not) a lie/", "timestamp_created": 1496092056, "timestamp_updated": 1496092074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 189, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.933283984661102295", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13510561": {"recommendationid": "13510561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025939618", "num_games_owned": 1281, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2221, "last_played": 1453434927}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] One of the Best Games I've Ever Experienced\t[/h1]\n\n[b] Cut From a Different Cloth\t[/b]\n\nDue to the fact that The Talos Principle is a science fiction based first person puzzler, it\u2019s hard not to make comparisons to Portal. However, while Portal is a more lighthearted game, the Talos Principle is more somber and thought-provoking. Drawing inspiration from writers like Isaac Asimov, Philip K. D*i*c*k (Apparently Steam doesn't like his last name), and John Milton, as well as a number of philosophers, it takes a much different approach to the puzzle genre.\n\n[b] Deeper Thinking\t[/b]\n\nWith heavy philosophical undertones, you will find yourself thinking beyond the puzzles as the very world around you is questioned. This, in combination with a visually stunning environment, creates one of the most wonderful and unique experiences that I've had in a game.\n\n[b] Gameplay\t[/b]\n\nPlaying as an android, you must solve puzzles while at the same time being posed a series of increasingly introspective questions about your existence. I am going to refrain from saying anything more about the story so as not to spoil anything. This is a highlight of this game and is best experienced by going in to it knowing as little as you possibly can. \n\nThe puzzles are very unique, with various elements being added throughout to provide for an experience that never once felt repetitive to me. In these puzzles you will collect sigils using boxes, jammers, crystal prisms to connect lights, avoid mines, and float high up in to the air with fans. The most notable tool at your disposal is undoubtedly the ability to record yourself, allowing you to create what is basically a clone of yourself, which will act out your previous actions while you work with it in real time to solve the puzzle at hand.\n\nThe puzzles are very scattered in difficulty. Most were able to be solved in very little time, with a select few that I found myself having to really think about. If you want some more difficult puzzles, or you\u2019re like me and want to squeeze every second out of this game that you possibly can, then I highly recommend doing the extra puzzles which are marked by the stars. These are not required to finish the game, but I found them to be some of the most enjoyable ones to complete as they can be more challenging and mind-bending, forcing you to really think outside of the box (or designated puzzle areas). \n\n[b] A Beautiful World\t[/b]\n\nThe world is huge, often times even a bit overwhelming. There are quite a few secrets hidden around, so you will be rewarded for exploring. There are also messages and words scattered throughout which provide backstory as well as give you insight to other characters. These can be found on computer terminals, audio logs, and QR code graffiti, and really do add something special to the story. I really enjoyed finding these, and felt that it added a nice touch.\n\nNot only are the graphics superb but the music is lovely and perfectly suited for the various environments as well as puzzle solving.\n\nThere is also a huge amount of customization available in the options menu, which is always to be appreciated. This allows you to change the size of the game hub (or remove it entirely), remove cross-hairs, change from first-person view to third-person, etc. \n\n[b] My Verdict\t[/b]\n\nThis is a lengthy game, and at my time of completion of the storyline I have clocked about 37 hours of playtime. For this length and the high quality of this game, I feel that the current asking price is more than fair. This is hands down one of the best games I have ever played, and I can't recommend it enough.\n\n10/10 would erase from my memory and play again.", "timestamp_created": 1419204477, "timestamp_updated": 1551709594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 226, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915292799472808838", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31082604": {"recommendationid": "31082604", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 2268, "num_reviews": 917, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1246, "last_played": 1486069112}, "language": "english", "review": "I was not prepared for this one. I knew what it was, a first-person puzzler with a splash of philosophy. I was ready for puzzles, and I got excellent puzzles. I was ready for philosophy, and I got some cute interludes and snappy dialogues. What I was not ready for was an ending that fit it all together perfectly, so perfectly that I could barely contain the emotions it inspired. It's remarkable how solid a game The Talos Principle is in just its basic systems, but it is a singular accomplishment how powerful an experience they constitute in the end.\n\nI'm not telling you a damn thing about the story because that's where the magic happens with this one. You awaken in a bright garden among Greek ruins, and are directed to overcome trials scattered across the strange and picturesque world you find yourself in. These trials reward you with sigils which unlock doors that lead you closer to your ultimate goal. There's more going on than just puzzle-solving though, as you'll soon learn from the computer terminals standing among the trees and ruins.\n\nIt's a strange and otherworldly setup that frames the experience perfectly, putting you in the right mindset for some philosophical puzzling. The puzzles themselves will be familiar to fans of Portal, featuring buttons to place crates on, laser beams to redirect, force fields to jam, and more. There are about six core mechanics that comprise all the puzzles in how they combine and can be pushed to new functions. Puzzles are color-coded by difficulty and form a nice, smooth difficulty curve up to taxing your brain across the dozen hours or so it will take to complete them all.\n\nThere's more to these puzzles than meets the eye, though. Croteam loves secrets in their games, and nearly every level contains at least one secret, usually in the form of stars. Solving puzzles earns you sigils (Tetris pieces, really) that open up gates to later areas, helpfully color-coded for their function and also how difficult they are to obtain. But the stars can be anywhere in a puzzle hub, requiring you to notice slight details, solve clever riddles, or string together a complex solution between multiple puzzles. Gathering sigils will make you feel accomplished, but scoring a star will make you feel like a genius.\n\nWeaving through forcefields and linking laser networks will keep you plenty busy, but the terminals are what will really catch your attention. Every corner of the world has a computer to fiddle with, complete with its own DOS-style text interface. Though you choose your inputs from a menu they cover a wide range of commands and give you access to a perplexing array of files, articles, and correspondences. There's also another aspect of gameplay that you gain access to via terminals that I really really want to tell you about, but you absolutely have to experience it for yourself. It may seem a little off-putting at first, but rarely have I had my own concepts about the world challenged by a game as they were here.\n\nAs the story comes together through the terminals and you near the end of your quest, the environments and stakes rise to an impressive pitch. The final areas have a powerful air of permanence to them, as though your choices have far-reaching consequences. Throughout the game the puzzles continue to build in complexity and expand on the concepts they introduce, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the incredible climax. And then it ends, and what follows is without question the best ending I have ever experienced in a video game. It's not the longest or the prettiest or the most complex, but it is the perfect culmination of everything you accomplish in The Talos Principle. It was powerful enough to bring me to tears, and I really don't think there is any higher compliment I can give a game than that.\n\nWhat started out as a clever puzzle game grew to be one of my all-time top titles because of how expertly it formed a complete experience. Other games have amazing gameplay or story or graphics but rarely, if ever, do these elements combine and compliment each other so effectively. I was curious and uncertain about the game in the early hours but with each puzzle I solved, each terminal I explored, I became more and more drawn into the deep and gorgeous world laid before me. I reached a point where I could no longer bear to leave its secrets hidden, and uncovering them made me weep with joy. The Talos Principle is a game I feel fortunate and privileged to have played, and my time with it will surely remain one of my most treasured gaming memories.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Though it is, at it's core, a puzzler. The puzzles are often complex, a few head-scratchers, but sometimes require a more reductionist approach. What may seem complex at first may turn out to be very straightforward. At times it requires you to question the assumptions it has itself given you. Good exercise for the whole brain, as it doesn't train through repetition but demands both creativity and reason, both abstract thought and technical logic. Along with the puzzles a story gradually unfolds. Concepts of self, place and time begin to dawn while another mystery deepens. I like that the story is only hinted at and alluded to, so that you formulate the idea on your own. It makes it that much more meaningful and powerful. It is likely the most existential and eternally relevant topic one could imagine, and the story itself would make a fascinating novel or film. My only complaint is personal, that the game seems to make assumptions concerning beliefs, more specifically, that having them is a universal quality of humans. But this is not at all the case. At times it seemed as though the authors had an agenda to express their own beliefs, but perhaps this was just my suspicion of beliefs in general. The dialogue trees where multiple choice and never once did I actually agree with any of the choices. So it felt like being pigeon-holed and I ended up arguing for a point I didn't actually think was correct. Other than that minor brow-furrowing frustration, I really enjoyed spending time in the beautifully rendered game world. The music was lovely and atmospheric. Extremely smooth play with a good variety of menu options. It's rare that a puzzle game addresses both hemispheres of the brain as well as the subconscious mind. I strongly consider it a work of genius. Oh, and if you decide to play it, I left some messages for you. ;)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575360255 \nEdit for dlc: While a bit on the pricey side for a dlc, it is well worth it. For those seeking greater challenge, many of the puzzles in RtG are considerably more difficult than in the base game. With greater challenge comes greater satisfaction at solving them. Themes from the base game are carried over, and somewhat expanded upon, in a way that I found both humorous and enlightening. It seems to me nothing short of a mirror held up to human nature itself. My earlier point about feeling pigeon-holed in the interactions is rendered moot by new understandings and realizations. So it goes with real learning, when something this worthwhile makes it's dawn across the mind, all one can do is smile. :)", "timestamp_created": 1427613617, "timestamp_updated": 1451289577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 271, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.910238802433013916", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32939196": {"recommendationid": "32939196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043261849", "num_games_owned": 622, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3205, "last_played": 1621420045}, "language": "english", "review": "Grab it on sales, solve puzzles, question your life!\n\nFor all Portal lovers out there and just occasional puzzle solvers this gem is not to be passed by.\n\nPro\n+ non-linear: dozens of puzzles available at a time and you can solve them in any order thus never feeling stuck or frustrated\n+ puzzle diversity: it's not like you are solving same thing again and again\n+ great story: with cool philosophy ideas put into it, talos could rly strike my feelings\n+ scalable difficulty: complete the game by solving the minimum required puzzles and skipping the story or dive full in with hardcore quests, easter eggs and who knows, maybe even DLC packs?\n+ stunning graphics: from the sunshine flares to that gorgeous rock details the world this game rocks a nice visual style!\n+ soundtrack: sometimes I just wanted to run the game just to hear that tunes again.\n\nCon\n- devs could really work on that character animations, though only visible from third person view\n- physics in this game is okay for puzzles but feels a bit odd for some object interaction", "timestamp_created": 1498661367, "timestamp_updated": 1577001555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90666121244430542", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13819948": {"recommendationid": "13819948", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998301353", "num_games_owned": 853, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1419327978}, "language": "english", "review": "Comparing The Talos Principle to a game like Portal is unfair, but immediate. The first time I manipulated a gadget to set off a part of a puzzle, I muttered how much it reminded me of the amazing and witty Portal 1 and 2, and that trying to replicate it was unwise. However, I removed my premature opinions and discovered a whole new world of puzzle and story, placed perfectly in what is called The Talos Principle.\n\nThe game starts out in ruins, immediately piquing interest and curiosity. This first person interaction makes it impossible to know who you are, or what you are doing in the deserted grounds of what seems like Rome. The land is littered with broken pillars and faulty statues, most of which are missing their heads.\n\nVery shortly after running around, an all powerful voice beams from the skies, introducing himself and welcoming you to his garden. The puzzles ahead are a test to see if you are worthy (of what is unclear) and to strengthen your faith in him, \"ELOHIM.\"\n\nWithout going into spoilers, I must say that the story is my favorite part of this game. Despite everything right about The Talos Principle, I\u2019m a sucker for a great story, and very few games have the tone that this one carries beautifully and makes one question the nature of humanity. Almost every word spoken or typed holds a deeper meaning. Nothing is there without reason, and everything is set up in such a way that I didn\u2019t feel left out of anything. There will be no regrets to finishing this game and seeing everything tie together.\n\nGameplay is very simple, which is nice, because the puzzles are not. Having the option, I opted for controller, assuming I could sit back, relax, and enjoy a nice, scenic mind game. I was wrong. Despite the scenery being beautiful and the music peaceful, my anxiety levels were high, attempting to freeze the laser gun that will shoot you down and sneak past the bots that will blow you up. And that\u2019s within the first puzzles. You can\u2019t do much on your own, only using what is provided to pass each task. It makes learning controls easy, which is nice when you have to take most of your focus into the puzzle.\n\nThere are only a handful of gadgets as well, each with a specific task that they do. Don\u2019t be fooled though, because sometimes they are good for more than what they are intended. The puzzles themselves are short, only getting a little longer with time. Difficulty levels vary, but progress nicely with you, rather than slamming you with something impossible. There are also several puzzles per section, which gives you some options in case you get stuck. This attribute is great as the story is a heavy part that everyone should be able to complete.\n\nWhat the game lacks in wit and comic relief, it replaces with promise and charm as that nagging curiosity presses you forward. There is a lot of content, which can be overwhelming if you want to follow the story, but luckily the audio tracks and journal entries are logged and easy to access at any time.\n\nAnother nice feature is the hunt for stars, which can be within the puzzle or just randomly hidden on the selected map. It had a lingering feel of Mario 64 about it. It also gives you a break from some frustrating enigmas and allows you to enjoy the landscapes. The signs are helpful to look at as well, so use them. They even mark off what you have completed, though who does it for you is unknown. Kind of spooky, right?\n\nThe Talos Principle doesn\u2019t let down on graphics, either. Each stage and each little world is beautifully done, with sounds and music to match. Voice acting was very well done, allowing you to stay immersed in the game. The settings are almost too good to be real, which makes the game ever more creepy. Keep a look out when just walking around. There are some questionable sights on the rocks, in the water. You are clearly the only one around which raises the question, \u201cwhere is everyone else?\u201d Though questions like this will be answered, the theories I came up with thanks to the surrounding areas wwere a little unsettling.\n\nWith all of the story, the background, creepy settings, and subtle hints, I\u2019d say this game is very replayable, especially if you are like me and forget how to do the puzzles. I know I\u2019m one to miss things the first time around, so going back is always good.\n\nDespite the eerie feeling I got every time I turned the game on, I was so compelled to read the QR codes on the walls, left by others before me. I wanted to understand the notes in the computer library and I wanted to know who ELOHIM really was, and what he wanted with me. All of this and more is explained if you are strong enough to pass over 120 puzzles in The Talos Principle.\n\nAbstract:\n\n    Story 9.5\n    Gameplay 9.25\n    Graphics 9.5\n    Sound 10\n    Replayability 8.75\n    Controls 9.5\n\nPositives\n\n    Story is amazing\n    Easy to learn\n    Beautiful\n\nNegatives\n\n    Slightly monotonous\n    Very little guidance \n\nOverall Score\n\n 9.25/10", "timestamp_created": 1420333274, "timestamp_updated": 1420333274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 371, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902468681335449219", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14287995": {"recommendationid": "14287995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004712453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1030, "last_played": 1424049699}, "language": "english", "review": "A computer terminal in the game asked me why I wanted so much to prove I'm human.

It\u2019s a first / third-person puzzler, yes; but is cast into a class entirely of its own by its narrative focus on philosophy, religion, self-reflection, and the human experience. A game of such subject matter lives or dies on its execution, and all I can say is that The Talos Principle knocks it so far out of the park that the ball undoubtedly entered orbit and landed on the opposite side of the planet. I first played Talos in the summer of 2016, and having replayed and re-reviewed it now in the summer of 2019, I must say it still stands in my mind as one of the greatest games of all time.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nOne of the essential aspects of The Talos Principle experience is the mystery of what the hell is going on in the story. At the beginning of the game, you awake in the tranquil ruins of an Ancient Greek courtyard. You are immediately spoken to by an authoritative voice in the sky, telling you that you are risen from the dust, that you walk in His garden, that He is your maker, and that His name is ELOHIM. If you swap into third-person view, you\u2019ll also notice that you\u2019re a humanoid robot. From this point forward you\u2019re set to the task of completing puzzles to collect sigils, listening to Elohim, reading old terminal logs, and conversing with a strange computer program about philosophical problems. It\u2019s all quite cryptic, as the game leaves much about these circumstances to your interpretation and further discovery. Notably analogous to real life, I\u2019d say\u2026.\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]\nCooling off from the build-up to an existential breakdown, let\u2019s wander down the path of the aesthetic for a moment instead. Originally released in 2014, TTP is admittedly a bit outdated graphically. While the lighting and environmental detail remain absolutely stunning, the textures, animations, and post-processing effects are somewhat hard on the eyes. I find the realistic visual aesthetic of Talos charming, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m as impressed as I was in 2016. To make up for the dated graphics though, are the wonderful sound design and polished performance. The audio quality is as superb as any AAA release in 2019, with a terrific soundtrack to boot. Talos runs smoothly on all modern hardware too; crashes and bugs are virtually non-existent. Though a bit showing of its age, TTP still presents itself wonderfully.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay (Puzzles)[/u][/b]\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it\u2019s all varying degrees of puzzling, really. There are three different themed \u201chub-temples\u201d (hub-worlds), each of which contain seven levels with 3-5 puzzles to complete on them. Finishing a puzzle rewards you with a sigil, which are used to unlock later levels, as well as new tools which allow you to beat other puzzles. It all sounds logistically confusing when written out, but take me at my word when I say it\u2019s not that difficult to understand in-game. The actual puzzles themselves are fun and well balanced, challenging the player with sensible and intelligent problems. Talos\u2019 difficulty curve increases gradually and the puzzles get highly demanding by the end, but I\u2019d never say the game is unfair. Altogether, The Talos Principle is great as a 3D puzzler.\n\n[b][u]Exploration & Easter Eggs[/u][/b]\nIn TTP, there are plenty of beautiful vistas to find, and side content to consume. The bulk of this side content is contained within computer terminals, each of which hold various documents pertaining to religious and philosophical ideas, or 21st century writings connected to the story of the in-game player character. Every level has an obviously placed terminal to read from, but some are hidden and must be found through exploration. There are also 23 audio logs dispersed throughout Talos, but I will not spoil their purpose. Scattered across the game\u2019s walls are QR codes too, which immediately translate into English to share a message left by robots who had undertaken the trials of Elohim\u2019s world before you. Finally, intense exploration reveals hidden puzzles and funny easter eggs, but I\u2019ll leave them for you to uncover yourself.\n\n[b][u]Narrative[/u][/b]\nGetting back to the main narrative, it has three moving parts. The first is the aforementioned ELOHIM, the voice in the sky who portrays himself, for all intents and purposes, as God. He acts as the voice of purpose; telling you yours is to collect sigils, and eventually join him in his kingdom of eternal life. The second is the Milton Library Assistant, who I referred to earlier as a strange computer program accessible in the terminals. Milton acts as the voice of skepticism; cross examining the philosophical beliefs of you as the player, and positing that the reality you exist in isn\u2019t truly real. The last moving piece is one I haven\u2019t mentioned yet \u2013 the tower. ELOHIM makes a covenant with you on the outset of the game, stating that all the worlds of TTP are yours to roam, but that if you climb the tower at the center of these realms, \u201cyou will surely die.\u201d Milton, of course, urges you to climb it. In short, you may as well be Adam or Eve, caught between The Lord and the serpent; God and Satan.\n\n[b][u]Religion, Philosophy, & Rationality[/u][/b]\nIf I haven\u2019t already been explicit enough, there\u2019s a clear war of ideas in TTP. ELOHIM is a manifestation of religion and the everlasting human spirit; Milton of rationality and existentialism. The tour de force of their ideologies can only be mediated and put in proper balance by the philosophy of one person, and that\u2019s you. As you navigate the ideological battlegrounds of The Talos Principle, you\u2019ll be challenged on your beliefs and you will be effectively forced to reconsider your understanding of them. This intellectual give and take is what makes TTP so incredible \u2013 no game has ever delved into the psyche and motivations of the player so successfully. Talos is [i]the[/i] mind game.\n\n[b][u]Ethos & Purpose[/u][/b]\nAs a quick note of admiration, I simply have to give my heart out to the developers at Croteam. While this game was undoubtedly written by a gaggle of philosophy majors, the purpose of The Talos Principle is anything but obscure. TTP is a brilliant work of passion, cemented as such by the self-awareness of the developers to the limitations of their lives, and that of human life itself. That they chose to expend a portion of their mortality on a [b]video game[/b] ensconced in [b]philosophy[/b] is an act that can only be described as impossibly mad, and that\u2019s what makes Talos such a work of art. Because that\u2019s exactly what The Talos Principle unquestionably is: a work of art.\n\n[b][u]Games as Art[/u][/b]\nWhile not recognized by the mainstream as such, most people in the world of gaming understand that some titles are works of art. I take the position that The Talos Principle is the most pure work of art video gaming has ever produced. Its excavation of ancient and modern philosophy, the way it synthesizes all this source material into a profoundly meaningful experience, and the interpretive power offered to the player is, to me, the very definition of art. An original creation built upon the work of our forerunners which illuminates new meanings by way of personal interpretation? Nothing could be more good, true, and beautiful.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nI think my words up to this point make my opinion of the Talos Principle abundantly clear. It\u2019s a categorical masterpiece as a game, and beyond that, a true work of art. The only flaw I can find is that I can\u2019t play it again for the first time.

The game is well-polished, with a great storyline that will test your brains even when not completing puzzles.\n\n[h1]The Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Many Puzzles[/b] - Probably the most important aspect of puzzle games, and where, unfortunately, many disappoint, is the length. Not here. This game rocks a whopping 129 puzzle levels, enough to keep you busy for several hours! The trickiest part is the bonus \"Star Sigils\" that are hidden or hard to reach, and in order to do that you have to think outside the box and interact with items from different puzzles at once to obtain them. \n\n[*] [b]Interesting Lore[/b] - I won't spoil the story much, but around levels you will find terminals which give you access to a library containing many readable text files so you can learn about your purpose and the backstory to the game. These are optional, but offer a good read, and often times include easter eggs and gags.\n\n[*] [b]Breathtaking Characters[/b] - The peculiar thing about this game is that it made me feel like it had characters within it, even though you never actually see them. There is Elohim, a god-like voice in the Sky, Milton, a PC program and Alexandra, a mysterious woman who left recordings for you to find. Even though the former two are not real, but artificial intelligence, the way you interact with them and the dialogues you can have with Milton really make you feel like there is someone you are interacting with. Croteam managed, using only text messages and voice recordings to give you a sense of wonder. Around the world you can also find QR codes (which I've tested, they are actually real) that are the thoughts of other \"players\" from the past. Some of them appear often and you can even distinguish their personalities. Wonderfully done.\n\n[*] [b]Multiple Endings[/b] - A thing I find very important in games is choice. Here, you have an open world, and can complete any puzzle you want, at any time, granted you have enough sigils to unlock the area. After you have enough, you have four possible endings to discover. A nice touch.\n\n[*] [b]The Story[/b] - I promise, no spoilers. This should probably be the first on the list, but without managing to say much about the story so you can enjoy it, I will just say this: It is amazing. You just wake up, not knowing what or where you are and from that point on you just discover - pay attention to your surrounding, read the library entries, collect the sound files, read the QR codes left by those before you and get to a conclusion yourself. The story is also a reinterpretation of the Bible's Genesis chapter, and after you play the game, you will know why.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [b]No Custom Levels[/b] - The game features Steam Workshop, but it only has a few mods and not really any levels, nor does the game come with a level editor. This could have really extended the lifespan of the game, and I hope it will be implemented in later versions, or at least a free DLC. This does not take away from the gameplay experience and should not stop you from buying it.\n\n[*] [b]Level Diversity[/b] - Don't get me wrong, the levels are all unique in their own way and each serve a challenge, but the game items are only so many. You have the following logic items: Gates, Turrets, Guards, Lasers, Jammers, Fans, Buttons and Cubes... that's about it. While they are combined in wonderful, different ways, some tricks that are learned through earlier levels almost always give a very big hint on how to solve the difficult puzzles in later gameplay. I would have hoped it is not the same.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n[i]The Talos Principle[/i] is one of the best puzzle games I've encountered so far and definitely worth a purchase if you like a good mind game with suitable backstory and lore. Purchase with confidence, this indie game has better quality than some AAA games.\n\n[table][tr][td]Also check out my review of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/358470]The Talos Principle: Road to Gehenna[/url][/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[table][tr][td]If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, [b]consider joining my group[/b] and [b]follow my curator[/b] page!

So, if you're worried about your computer not being able to run the game, then fear not. I have a crappy integrated graphics card, and I can still run this game and its silky smooth. \n\nNow, lets get to the gameplay. \n\nAs others have said, you are just dropped into the world, and expected to figure things out for your self. There is no 'tutorial' on what objects do what or how you are supposed to solve a puzzle. You just figure it out. \n\nOne of my other favorite things about the game is the little QR codes that are strewn about the levels/world. Past 'test subjects' would leave notes for future 'test subjects'. Now, you can point your cursor at the QR code in game and it will display it, but I decided to download a QR code reader on my smart phone and scanned it with my camera and it reads it. Which I find is a really nice touch.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic and beautiful puzzle game. If you are a portal fan, then you'll deffinitely want to get this game. And remember, it will run smoothly on the crappiest of rigs.\n\n*Addition*\n\n-Since this review is gaining more attention, I decided to add a little more to my origional review of The Talos Principle. \n\nOne of the things I failed to mention the first time, is how the game is sort of non-linear.\nThere are 3 'for the sake of this review, lets call them sections' sections. A, B, and C. in each section, there are multiple worlds. In each world, there are multiple puzzles. If you're stuck on a puzzle, and can't figure it out, then you can just walk away and go to a different puzzle. When you're in the worlds, you can solve the puzzles in any order that you want and at your own pace, which I find really nice. \n\nMake sure to fully explore the worlds as well.

There're a ton of puzzles that can challenge your brain matter without being a huge time sink, while each spurring you to 'complete one more': they are also quite forgiving in terms of starting puzzles over or attempting to retrace steps. Knowing your avatar is 'merely' a robot somehow nags at the back of your mind as you strive to solve puzzle after puzzle - would an AI have done this better (Especially the tetris bit)? If so, how am I faring against it? Thoughts like this blend into the next point...\n\nPhilosophy/religion - this was the surprise that they did not have to tack onto the story but still did so to amazing effect. Through countless 'random' articles and the brilliant recordings of Erin Fitzgerald you can't help but find yourself sucked into the metaphysical questions and conundrums the game raises...and at the end; a Soma-esque ending that left me devastated...and changed. If a game can do this to you, especially not even through it's main 'game' mechanic...why wait?\n\nIf you've tried and loved The Turing Test or Soma and want more of the same, this won't disappoint. Especially if you're currently pondering the point of your life, or of humanity, history and religion as a whole: have no doubt; this one is for you. It's actually better than Soma as it doesn't tip over the edge into Nihilism, which my tired mind truly appreciates. I cannot fully describe how the points raised in the game mirrored the ideas I had going in my mind for so long yet had no way to put a name to; or to know that it was something the whole of humanity actually feels: Existentialism.\n\nPlay for the puzzles.

That's just a waste of time'', The Talos Principle might be one of the perfect example of video games to break that argument. This game it's about interesting fields that human race questioned and \nexplored:\n[list]\n[*]Philosophy\n[*]Religion\n[*]Society\n[*]Right and wrong\n[*]Artificial inteligence\n[*]And the most controversial and the most questioanble, human and his actions.\n[/list]\n  The Talos Principle has a an incredible story that sometimes can make you question your own life, your decisions and it can change your perspective about reality and what it really is. I cannot even consider this work as a game but maybe as a lesson about us and our purpose.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n  \n  The story its subjective and I wanna tell you one thing about it because if I write too much I will get caught in the details and I might spoil it and for sure this is an experience that you can live once. You wake up as a robot with no memories of what happend before or what might be your purpose, soon enough God (Elohim) tells you that you were awaken with the objective of gaining a place near him and gaining the eternal life. At some point after going through puzzles and collecting some of the sigils, you discover a tower. Elohim tells you that if you ascend the tower you won't have the eternal life and that many tried before you and failed. The interesting thing is that the game kind of appeals to your beliefs and by that I mean if you are an atheist in your deep you will question Elohim and you will maybe climb the tower driven by curiosty, in fact this scene have a lot of resolution to it because that is what human race is driven by, curiosty, otherwise you will follow Elohim instructions and doing your duty without forbidding his word. You will learn more about the game and the story through terminals.\n  The game is not linear, letting you choose the next move and having more endings, each ending reflecting your morality, choices and beliefs. It also have a lot of replay value.\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\n  \n   It's really simple, you must solve puzzle in order to explore next stages of the game. The game looks gorgeous and combined with the relaxing soundtrack resulting an incredible atmosphere. The puzzles at start are easy and going trough more they tend to become harder, however the harder ones are marked with red, medium ones with yellow and the easy ones are marked with green. You must solve the puzzles in order to reach the ending, but there are also stars that doesn't need to be collected (those are really hard and many) and by collecting them you get a secret ending. Puzzles in order to be completed you must, move a box to a terminal, reflecting lights and sometimes using airflow that will open the way to the sigil in that chamber. As I said above there are terminals, some of them have question for you and you must answer to those question in order to solve the text story puzzle.\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\n  \n   The Talos Principle it's an amazing game, with an incredible clever plot, a relaxing atmosphere, gorgeous landscapes and a fiting gameplay. However if you think that you are not into puzzles, I can assure you that puzzles are not all that this game is about.It has a lot of content and you must sink a lot of hours in it in order to reveal the truth. With that being said I can guarantee that this game deserves all the money and it's that kind of a game that you might wanna buy even if it's not on sale right now, whichever might be this is not a game, but a lesson.

Initially I was very enthusiastic, liked the idea, style of the puzzles, and also - criticized by some - philosophical threads dealing with mysticism, religion, AI, meaning of life etc. Then after some time I felt a bit tired of doing similar puzzles and just needed some time away. But then come back was again very entertaining, until I was tired... and so on. I finished the game in such sinusoid-like cycles. Why was like that?\nOne of the reasons is annoying lack of 'save anywhere' option. I did not like that I had to repeat large part of some more complex puzzle because I 'died' and was forced to redo the puzzle from start. After some second/third \"not again!\" I was leaving the game as I do not like silly repeating. It should be possible to preserve any progress done.\nFortunately most puzzles are free from this issue and only few are fillled with killing machines in this annoying way.\n\nPuzzles are entertaining and well balanced, in rare cases the difficulty is raised just by hiding something a bit too much - second reason for taking a break...\n\nRelation between the puzzles and storyline is limited, but unlike others - I do not see it as a problem. I just enjoyed both. \nThe storyline built from pieces of text heard or available in computer systems is a mixture of philosophy, science and religion from ancients to some futurisms. Of course all could be heard here and there, but still I find it a lot deeper than what's found in most games and makes to think a bit about things detached from our materialistic bullsh-t world. It nicely diverts from just solving puzzles.\n\nThe good:\n- the artwork - music and graphics are very pleasant and well corresponds to \"storyline\"\n- generally good puzzles - with few minor annoyances\n\nThe bad:\n- lack of \"save anywhere\" - death results in resetting the puzzle (annoying in few cases)\n\nPS.

Some I breezed through, some required some head scratching, and a couple required coming back a couple times with fresh perspectives - and all felt good and rewarding at the end. Super satisfying.\nThat's just the normal puzzles, though. The gold star puzzles wrinkled my brain in a good way - I'd say I got maybe 60% unassisted, and the rest kicked my ass (most of them in a good way, although there were a couple that I never would have gotten). A fantastic stretch if you really wanna go the extra mile.\nAnd the last layer on top of the puzzles and gold stars is the easter eggs - they're everywhere. Some are easier to find than others, but oh man, they're everywhere, very clever, and stealthily hid. I found three out of I can only assume dozens.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nA puzzle game is all well and good, but how is it tied together? Portal did so in a comedic meta way - Portal 1 was pretty much all comedy, where Portal 2 did have a bit of a plot to piece together. The Talos Principle has comedy, but each puzzle draws you closer to piecing together the whole story, which is very compelling. It's a clever premise well executed that absolutely adds to the mechanic.\nAnd I really did love the story here. Plenty of little bits and pieces to keep you interested, building the world as you went. From reading texts to hearing audiologs to reading QR codes left by others, it all merges together to make a fantastic experience.\n\nAnd yes, I cried at the end. While there are games for which this wouldn't be a surprise, this one did surprise me. It's a puzzle game! But the whole thing was so artfully executed I couldn't help but get drawn in. Beautiful and poignant and sad and hopeful and amazing.\n\nI look forward to playing it again. <3", "timestamp_created": 1461216231, "timestamp_updated": 1461216231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841056227684020996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97643706": {"recommendationid": "97643706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085260029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2859, "last_played": 1628984052}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish I could erase my memory and play this game again.", "timestamp_created": 1629068742, "timestamp_updated": 1629068742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840672552585601807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114142629": {"recommendationid": "114142629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277696937", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2199, "last_played": 1651515636}, "language": "english", "review": "Come for the puzzles, stay for the existential crisis.", "timestamp_created": 1650399077, "timestamp_updated": 1650399077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840563356876373291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35279945": {"recommendationid": "35279945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388937885", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1866, "last_played": 1626114230}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was the reason I downloaded Steam in the first place.\n\nI had always been a huge fan of puzzle games such as Portal, and this game was no exception.

I bet I will really enjoy this,\u201d I sarcastically said to myself when the pre-order page went up. I did enjoy it. It is wonderful. It is easily one of the best games I\u2019ve played.\n\nThe Talos Principle is one giant existential question that can be answered through solving over one hundred smaller, physics-based puzzles under the guidance of your maker, Elohim, whose intimidating voice attempts to influence you from above at every turn. This might seem a strange way to label the game\u2019s genre, but it\u2019s accurate and the story manages to never feel at all pretentious despite addressing philosophical subject matter. While the majority of your time is spent solving the smaller puzzles, it always feels as if you\u2019re doing it for a higher purpose or to unravel the larger mystery looming overhead, so the game successfully maintains a careful balance where both the story and puzzles are one and equally important.\n\nThis journey takes you through several temple-like environments, each containing a number of doorways leading to distinct worlds. In each of these worlds, you\u2019ll find several self-contained puzzle areas that can also occasionally interact with each other in an advanced way to reveal secrets, and you'll access computer terminals to gradually uncover lore, important context and bits of the story. Completing puzzles rewards you with pieces used to solve tetromino puzzles that unlock doors to new environments, even more puzzles, and new tools used to steadily increase puzzle difficulty and prevent them from becoming stale.\n\nSolving puzzles requires manipulating and avoiding mobile mines, turrets, laser beam connectors, fans and cubes, as well as cooperating with recordings of yourself replaying your actions, but it never gets frantic and you\u2019ll never feel hurried. There\u2019s no real dexterity or speed requirement here, so you can relax and figure things out at your own pace. \n\nInitially, puzzles aren\u2019t very challenging but you\u2019ll come to appreciate how increasingly clever they are. At some point, I thought I\u2019d outsmarted the game only to discover later this isn\u2019t possible and it was always meant to be so open and unrestrictive. The most difficult puzzles are only required if you want to find all of the secrets within the game and discover as many answers as possible, which is highly recommended and completely worth the effort.\n\nThe Talos Principle takes itself seriously and explores concepts like faith, free will, humanity, loyalty and purpose, with your journey unfolding much like that of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden: In the beginning, you don't know or question much and simply follow instructions but, by the time you wander around and have your first taste of knowledge, you may develop a thirst for it and begin to question everything around you. It's easy to become completely engrossed in the setting.\n\nIf you don't enjoy reading in games and skip through text, you'll miss out on a lot of what makes The Talos Principle more than just another good game, but it's still worth playing even for the puzzles alone. On a technical level, the game is impeccable: graphics, sound, voice acting, controls and optimization are all top-notch, and there are even settings for proper AA and field of view. The environments are beautiful, as is the soundtrack.\n\nOn a final note, QR codes that reveal text are left behind on walls by NPCs and friends who have played the game before you and you can also leave these pre-written messages for your Steam friends. One of these messages claims you\u2019ve discovered the most beautiful spot in the game and, as there is a number of beautiful landscapes, I had been trying to decide where to leave that message for quite a while. I had been playing in first-person the entire time and ultimately left the message somewhere I never expected to: next to a mirror I encountered late in the game.

Puzzle games, until now, really haven't captured my imagination or interest.\n\nThe thing that drew me to the Talos Principle was the notion that it combined a puzzle game, and a beautifully rendered one at that, with notions of the meaning of intelligence, the question of how \"life\" can be defined, what \"artificial intelligence\" would look like. I have a keen interest in philosophy, something that the reviews stated was very much at the center of the Talos Principle. So, I decided to take the plunge and I'm *extremely* glad that I did so.\n\nThe game is beautifully presented. The Serious engine (as in the FPS game Serious Sam) presents a very nicely rendered world. Each of the puzzles is set in themed ancient Roman, ancient Greek or medieval settings. Having recently spent a week in Rome the ancient Roman themed portions were very familiar and very well representative of ancient Roman remains.\n\nThe puzzles themselves ramp up very well in terms of difficulty, with early ones being very simple to solve. Later puzzles and in particular special puzzles that grant access to bonus areas can be absolutely fiendish. That being said, unlike most puzzle games I've never given up in disgusted frustration - the puzzles and tools that you unlock to assist you are intuitive enough to make you want to solve the puzzle to progress or to unlock more of the thematic content.\n\nSpeaking of which, this game is superbly grounded in philosophy, well presented themes from science fiction and indeed theology. Far from being a simple solve-this-puzzle-then-on-to-the-next, this game makes the player really think about such questions as who they are (in game), what they are and whether you are in fact merely a metaphorical rat in a maze. It should be noted that the game absolutely does not require any knowledge of philosophy or sci-fi tropes, but if you are familiar with the concepts developed by the likes of Soren Kierkegaard, Lev Shestov, Carl Sagan or A.C. Clark the game is absolutely that much more immersive and enjoyable.\n\nI'm really, really impressed by the Talos Principle on many different levels. This is one of the most intelligently designed and presented games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Everything from the graphics, quality of the voice acting, in-game presentation, music, even the controlls have obviously been developed with a lot of thought.\n\nBored of yet another generic, mindless, so-called \"AAA blockbuster\" game that was identical to the last 5? Give this game a try, you'll be amazed and impressed by how fun it is to play and perhaps more importantly how it makes you really think.\n\nAbsolutely 10/10.

As you can see, I've put more hours than anyone reasonably should into it. I do still think it's an amazing game, but after what's happened in the \"recent\" updates I can no longer recommend it.\n\nOn February 23rd 2019, after over a year without any updates at all, they suddenly came out with the beta that ruined everything. The older version itself was released 8 months after the one before it, it basically seemed like support for the game had ended. But out of nowhere they came and upgraded the entire engine. Normally this would be seen as a sign of great devs, but it introduced so many small issues that have never been fixed.\n\nOne of the biggest changes was that they removed 32 bit, open gl,  and directx 11 support. Have an older pc that barely fits the minimum posted requirements? Won't work on current patch. Most people will only find this out when they've downloaded everything and the game refuses to launch, and if they troubleshoot enough they'll find out they just need to redowload the whole game on an older version. The only place is says this is a pinned thread in the forums, which no one will check untill they start having issues, there's no warning on the store page or when you try run the (non-existent) 32 bit version.\n\nAnother big issue was licence validation, though this seems to be mostly fixed now. The update added stricter license checks, which caused many false positives on people who legitimately bought the game and hadn't tampered with files, preventing them from even launching the game.\n\nBut the biggest crime is what they did to the workshop. It is completly unusable now. 4 years of mods all gone. There were some amazing custom campaigns (Rebirth, Schr\u00f6dinger Cat, Only Puzzles 2) that could easily add hundreds of hours of playtime, but you can't play any of them anymore. The update changed where the maps are stored on disk, but just moving them over isn't enough. They also redid how light maps, and a few other mostly irrelevant features, work, so every single map has to be re-saved to work. These old map makers from years ago aren't all going to come back just for that. But to add insult to injury, once you've fixed everything, you can't even upload your fix. [b]They broke workshop uploads. [/b]\n\nThis was all reported months ago ( https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/464416372756054027/642277787008368641/State_of_the_Workshop.png ) but we've never gotten more than a \"we're looking into it\". The entire workshop has been unusable for months and nothing. It adds so much extra content and replayability to the game but nothing. This is why I cannot recommend this game.\n\nNow if you switch to the beta I mentioned at the top this all goes away, it just starts working again, you can play existing maps and upload your own all fine. This is why, if the rest of my review hasn't persuaded you, I still highly recommend switching into that beta.", "timestamp_created": 1479953131, "timestamp_updated": 1574997684, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.822603523731231689", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14473916": {"recommendationid": "14473916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015686881", "num_games_owned": 1946, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1784, "last_played": 1688319632}, "language": "english", "review": "We have a winner here people!

This is nothing like the uninspired, unoptimized cash-grabbing console ports we are used to nowadays.\n\nBut let me correct myself. This is not just a game, it is an experience. The talos principle will make you question your existence, your purpose in life. Even if you aren't really into philosophy, it will make you go look up some quotes of famous philosophers.\nEvery aspect of it is superb, the riddles, the visuals, the atmosphere, the music, everything works out.\nDon't expect it to hold your hand though.

It was as if this game was specifically made for me.\n\n The most important things for me in single player games are:\n\n- the quality and inventiveness of the mechanics\u2014and whether or not I can manipulate them in a meaningful way\n- immersion (which usually means first-person perspective, excellent sound design, etc..),\n- the writing/story\n\nRegarding mechanics, combat-focused games are the majority in the industry\u2014especially on PC and especially in first-person games\u2014so those that aren\u2019t centered on combat often must work more creatively to be interesting\u2014games like Myst (1993) and Portal (2007). This is also true of games which have combat, but also offer non-combative methods to play through the game (stealth/sneaking, for example)\u2014ie., Deus Ex (2000), Splinter Cell (2002), and Dishonored (2012). These are my favorite types of games\u2014especially the latter, perhaps because the avoidance of combat adds a further complication to the mechanics of gameplay. So, I was really excited about the First Person Puzzle design of Talos when I played the demo at PAX Prime 2014. It was love at first sight in the demo booth. I had trouble getting through the last couple demo levels on my first try, but it was still extremely satisfying and fun. As I sat struggling with the connectors and fans and boxes, of the fellows from Croteam warned me the Enforcers were coming to run everyone out of the Indie Megabooth, but told me to come back the next day to finish the demo\u2014they\u2019d get me back where I\u2019d left off. So I went back the next morning, finished the demo, and gushed to Croteam about how interesting I found the game and how excited I was to play it on release. I tried to explain that it reminded me of playing Deus Ex and System Shock 2. It\u2019s hard to articulate exactly how Talos relates to these types of games, but they all give me the same kind of satisfaction upon completing an area, even if the mechanics and design are quite different\u2014the end feeling as a player is similar, so there\u2019s some kind of overlap in how the gameplay works on the player. And the first-person immersion helps with that. (I should note here that you can play the game in third-person and easily switch between first- and third-person. I simply prefer first.)\n \nMore on gameplay: the puzzles were great. I found the most satisfying bits to be finding the optional stars because I had to find ways to \u201cbreak\u201d the game (or at least The Great Voice in the Sky\u2019s intentions\u2026 hehe) to get them. The puzzles in general\u2014sigils, stars, and easter eggs\u2014had that kind of excellent satisfaction to them\u2014some of them were teaching the player the possibility of the mechanics, while others encouraged the player to break beyond the narrow way in which puzzle/first-person mechanics usually work. As I mentioned, in some ways Talos really reminded me of experiences playing the original Deus Ex and System Shock 2; there were ways to play those games that literally did break them, just because of the limitations of game development/AI functionality at the time. That\u2019s not to mention that they had multiple routes to play the levels built in already. Talos also achieved the same type of feeling that the Half-Life games produce where it feels like you\u2019re breaking the game\u2014pulling one over on the level designers and outsmarting the game\u2014but in reality that is because levels were designed so well. They were built in a way to teach you to break the limitations and expectations of regular gameplay. I remember the first time I got stuck in Half-Life and after I searched every possible route out of the area, realizing I could climb on the pipes to escape where I was\u2014like, I was so shocked that there was platforming in my FPS! I remember feeling as if I was outsmarting the game, but looking back, of course there really was no other way to get out of the level. Yet it was built in a way that made that fact satisfying instead of frustrating.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning: the QR codes. Without saying much, there is functionality built into the game to leave messages on the walls for other players (people on your Steam friends list) to see later. It might seem like a small thing\u2014but it really was a great little touch and made the game even more immersive.\n\nSo I was super hyped for Talos\u2019s gameplay, and it still delivered beyond my expectations. But I gotta say that the writing and storyline was on the same level, in really impressive ways. It was subtle but powerful, and\u2014without saying too much\u2014I liked how it played with the ideas of free will and game-imposed confines of \u201cchoice\u201d. I guess what I mean is, the game\u2014mechanics-wise\u2014were already top notch quality and impressive. But the story\u2014the character development through audio logs, the slow revelation of the story through classical literature and other text artifacts, the QR codes, the interactions with the terminals\u2014made it even richer. Basically Talos combined all of my favorite aspects about video games in a really fresh, great way. And it also took advantage of some of the best avenues that science fiction opens up for those ever-important literary questions... \u201cWhat is the world like, and what does it mean to be human in that world?\u201d Despite the rambling nature of this post, I actually double majored in Literature and History at university. So this game just... I feel like this game was made for me. And I was made to play it! (All that said\u2014if you\u2019re not interested in story, you can completely ignore and not investigate any of that and still enjoy the game for its excellent mechanics. But I\u2019d still recommend getting into the story!)\n\n All in all, I recommend it 100%.

It was released on Steam in December 2014, before later being released on PS4 in October 2015. \n\nThe game play within Talos could be considered very similar to that of Portal. You can play in either first person or third person, as you are presented with tons of puzzles on every stage. Each stage you complete, you unlock a new tool that you will need to use in some form in the following stage. I really liked this way of introducing new mechanics to the game as it lets you get to grips with the previous set very easily before dumping a ton of new stuff on you again. The puzzles start off quite easily as you would expect in the game but they soon take a very high difficulty rise, meaning I was completely stumped for the most of my play through. There is an element of trial and error with a lot of the puzzles as there is a quick reset button to use that takes you right back to the start of the puzzle and you will end up having to do this a lot.  \n\nGraphically I was very impressed with The Talos Principle; it looks clean and fresh with extremely high production values. The lighting and weather effects in the game are stellar and really take it to a new level of quality. I was playing at 4k with the majority of the settings turned up to the max, apart from antialiasing. I did however get motion sickness whilst playing in first person view; I think it was a mixture of the speed that the character was traveling at and the motion blur. I had to eventually switch from first person to third person and this solved the problem. The game runs on Serious Engine 4 \u2013 this is the only game to use it so far, but it is almost identical to serious engine 3 and 3.5 which were used in the latest Serious Sam titles. \n\nI found the plot to be very interesting, having really enjoyed Greek mythology from other games, my interested was peeked from the get go. There are a lot of extra bits of plot and lore to learn about through collectables and computer terminals for you to access as you explore the different levels. I took a lot of time to seek them all out to learn as much as possible.  The game has various different endings as well depending on how you progress throughout your play through. \n\nLike I said above, the difficulty really scales quite highly as you get past the first or second stage of levels. I had to use walkthroughs to even come close to finishing the game and even then I struggled and had to refer to videos as well! Whilst I found the game play to remind me a lot of Portal, the difficulty is certainly on a different scale compared. If you plan on playing this game without the aid of guides or wikis, then you are in for a real brain twister as some of the solutions to puzzles are so far out of the box that they were not even on my radar. \n\nI finished the game in just over twenty hours, so there is a lot of content, even for someone who thought I was completing the puzzles quite quickly with the guides. Not to mention the game\u2019s various different endings you can explore too. There are a lot of achievements you can unlock in each of the puzzles throughout the game, which may add some replay ability on as well.  Personally I find myself not wanting to go through again purely because I am normally not a massive fan of puzzle games. \n\nI didn\u2019t have any technical problems apart from the motion sickness issue as noted above, the game runs very well on 4k resolution at 60+ fps. It looks to be a very well optimized engine that I will be eagerly anticipating what else comes out of it. The game can be played with a controller but given the movement and preciseness of some of the actions you have to take, I would strongly recommend using a keyboard and mouse.  \n\nMy conclusion on The Talos Principle is quite simple. If you are a fan of mind bending puzzles with really obscure solutions to them, then you are going to absolutely love this game. If you are like me and are only going to manage the first two stages without a guide, you may want to err on the side of caution with your purchase. Whilst I am going to recommend this game, it definitely gets a lot of bonus points from the extremely high productions values on show from the start right until the final scenes. As someone who has the brain like a sieve and finds the puzzle side of the game to be difficult I didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as other games. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]4) Recommended[/u][/b]\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

However this is very much the case as The Talos Principle is a fascinating and mentally invigorating experience with clever puzzles and a highly intriguing philosophy laden science fiction backdrop. The game slowly generates an atmosphere of mind-bending contemplation unlike anything I have experienced before in games thanks to a potent mixture of clever writing and music that starts to get under your skin. I think only 2001 A Space Odyssey has given me the same feeling before. \n\nThe puzzles themselves are the star of the show however with a good difficulty curve and consistently excellent design. Some puzzles which have you dodging floating mines can be annoying, but the vast majority require clever thinking rather than quick reflexes or good timing. The puzzles are short but require you to use existing mechanics in new and surprising ways. The game lets you figure almost everything for yourself, from the story to the mechanics, but the world and puzzles are laid out in such a way that this is generally not a problem. There are loads of secrets/optional challenges that help add further substance to the game after you finish working through the main set of puzzles. I did not spend a lot of time going after these and finished the game in about 15 hours, I would say it is well worth the forty dollar asking price. \n\nIf you have even a passing interest in puzzle games and don\u2019t mind confronting some heavy philosophical/nihilist ideas (among some more hopeful ones), I can\u2019t recommend The Talos Principle highly enough.", "timestamp_created": 1419545561, "timestamp_updated": 1419577204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81145864725112915", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76131395": {"recommendationid": "76131395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440531795", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1600587111}, "language": "english", "review": "Came for the puzzles stayed for an existential crisis.", "timestamp_created": 1600365566, "timestamp_updated": 1600365566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810945272445678711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45209761": {"recommendationid": "45209761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035931277", "num_games_owned": 1562, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 4997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4876, "last_played": 1539207357}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably *the* premiere puzzle game of all time, with a healthy dose of philosophy.

Maps are so truthfully built in old times fashion that I had a feeling that these environments I was walking through (spoiler:  [spoiler] main game separates in ancient Roman, Egyptian and medieval periods [/spoiler]) were actual representations of those times\u2019 cities.\n\nFinally, as a Croat I am so proud that this game was developed by my fellow Croatians at Croteam.", "timestamp_created": 1591228732, "timestamp_updated": 1592002385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789372920989990234", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32031426": {"recommendationid": "32031426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040805978", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2018, "last_played": 1507002575}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is what happens if you tell a philosophy professor to write a video game with a prompt of \"[i]Portal[/i] meets [i]The Matrix[/i].\"", "timestamp_created": 1496014524, "timestamp_updated": 1496014524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784829258918762207", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100818063": {"recommendationid": "100818063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042995487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1634849410}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game to play when you're having an existential crisis.", "timestamp_created": 1633836105, "timestamp_updated": 1633836105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78428339958190918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13579482": {"recommendationid": "13579482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009335202", "num_games_owned": 587, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1823, "last_played": 1437757639}, "language": "english", "review": "Croteam, after their hallmark series Serious Sam managed to create the first puzzler game on the level of Portal 2, which was unexpected, to say the least. After having played through the game, it is definitely my game of the year 2014 for various reasons, which I'll break below into several sections:\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nAt the start of the game, you awaken as a android which is tasked with solving puzzles, for which Elohim - your maker, promises you eternal life. The story is told mostly through logs found in terminals scattered around the world, but also serve for communication with Milton, a library assistant and an intelligence with which you discuss some intriguing philosophical dilemmas. While Elohim encourages the player to explore it's creations, he explicitly prohibits venturing into the tower, which soars into the sky. As the story progresses, Milton encourages the player to act independently, and motivates him to enter the tower and find out the truth for himself.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game starts slowly by introducing gameplay elements (some of which are unlocked by solving specific puzzles) and the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up pretty fast, but they are never unfair - even if some of them may be excruciatingly hard. If there is a situation where the player may get stuck, it's because some specific mechanics and uses of elements aren't expected or explained beforehand. Example: some puzzles utilize your own body for intentionally blocking lasers, which the player himself might not think for some time. One thing that may get on some player's nerves is the reset ability, which you will use at some point to unstuck yourself from an unsolvable jam. It resets the entire room along with all the progress you might have made, which can be somewhat annoying in longer puzzles which take some time to progress through. Once you do solve a particularly tricky puzzle, you are glad you persisted and managed to solve it on your own. On most puzzles there is a shrine you can use to get a hint if you get stuck (although some hints are too vague and don't help as you might expect), but getting that hint requires solving some hidden puzzles which are not a part of the main story, but are worth exploring any ways as they have the most beautiful locations in the entire game. If you find yourself a bit short on hints, you may want to play Sigils of Elohim, a free companion mini-game in which you may get an additional 3 hints.\nThere are four worlds in the game, which go as follows:\n[b]Mediterranean[/b] - ancient Greek/Roman themed world\n[b]Egypt[/b] - puzzles spread out in the desert, borrowed aesthetics from Serious Sam 3\n[b]Medieval[/b] - typical medieval style with ruined castles in a forest\n[b]Tundra[/b] - the \"main\" world in which the tower and the three other hub worlds are located\n\nYou start your adventure in the Mediterranean world and gradually unlock the Egypt and medieval worlds with puzzles, which are spread out into different rooms in every world. You can play the puzzles pretty much in any order, which is welcome if you are stuck in a particular puzzle, so the player can skip that particular one for the time being and return later on with a fresh approach, unlike in fully linear games like Portal.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe game has some very nice visuals, particularly if you look at the texture quality (Example: look closely at the greek-style fresca scattered through the ruins of the first world, or just looking at the floor mosaic in the third world hub cathedral). There are some hidden locations with truly great visuals, so I definitely encourage anyone to explore the game fully, which will not go unrewarded. The game runs pretty well on older hardware, but don't expect wonders - the game likes stronger hardware, but it knows how to use it. If you played Serious Sam 3, you pretty much know what to expect, it's a visually slightly upgraded game, which is fine for my taste.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThis game has one of the best soundtracks this year, which you can listen for free in full here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J2xolKQjs8\nIt's one of the few games where I didn't have to turn the music off after some time as it blends in fantastically with the game. If you buy the sountrack DLC now, you might be a little bit dissapointed to find out that there's Elohim's voice in pretty much every track, making it a bit weird if you listen to the game's soundtrack in the public or at work. The game's developers promised to offer a versions without voiceovers, but we'll see.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI haven't had this much fun with a game in years, and Croteam did a stellar job with this game. If you like puzzle games, especially Portal 2, pick this game up immediately, you definitely won't regret it. For now the game the game doesn't have content beside the main campaign and the prototype maps DLC, but they shipped the game with the editor and full Steam workshop integration, and already the community started putting out stuff days after release, so we might get an abundant amount of content as time goes on.\n\n[h1]Update[/h1]\nIf you've played through the base game I highly recommend you pick up the \"Road to Gehenna\" DLC as it adds a good amount of hard puzzles which advance on both the mechanics and difficulty of the base game.", "timestamp_created": 1419467389, "timestamp_updated": 1479941417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783552944660186768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26715890": {"recommendationid": "26715890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149829467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2334, "last_played": 1479660142}, "language": "english", "review": "Loading analysis session...

With exquisite graphics, clever level design, impressive story and an astonishing amount of detail, it never failed to keep me deeply captivated, a result of I often found myself aimlessly exploring it's worlds, and just admiring the scenery and thinking about the many questions I had about it. Accompanied with beautiful music that matches it's diverse themes, the outcome is truly marvelous.\n\n[b]I didn't include any spoilers[/b]\n\nThe puzzle mechanics are very easy to understand and employ, and the game never tries to take advantage of a certain feature that is not exposed to the player, in order to make the puzzles more difficult, in this or any other unfair way. The difficulty is adequate, not necessarily forcing the player to complete all of the challenges in order to progress. If you get stuck in one of the more difficult puzzles and need to finish it, you can use an expendable helping system for passing it. But it has to be found and unlocked first, somewhere in the game. There are mutually-exclusive achievements for both using it and never trying it, to combat some potential morale doubts. The layout of it's mysterious world is very open but with an apparent order to it, so it's easy to distinguish where you should go next, if you don't like skipping things.\n\nThe levels aren't artificially restricting the player from going where he isn't supposed to (e.g. invisible walls) and if you're very observant, you can even expose certain level design flaws to get to the finish more quickly (if you don't have moral trouble with it or don't care for the \"correct\" solution of course), although I'm not entirely sure whether they are rare design flaws or just intentional shortcuts for the player thinking \"out of the box\". Sometimes, they can be just a part of some additional reward that is not entirely apparent on a first sight.\n\nYou'll probably enjoy this game if you're a keen explorer and easily tend to venture off the main path, as the beautiful, open worlds in Talos Principle often call for and even reward the player for his curiosity, with numerous secrets and an astounding ammount of well-crafted easter eggs (I've never seen a game that would have as many easter eggs as The Talos Principle, by the way). This curiosity for finding all the unnecessary secrets on my own and seeking out any parkour opportunities wherever possible has led me to finishing the game in nearly 100 hours, although I'd say it can easily be beaten on any ending in well under 50 hours.\n\nAnd if you don't mind to read and think a little, you may find a lot of thought-provoking topics and difficult decisions in the conversations you'll lead throughout the game, that produce different outcomes and may have a deeper impact later on. The story also encourages the player to sceptically think his way through, and to many questions the game might put upon you, there will hardly be any direct answers, but staying curious enough about the world and not rushing things will aid you sufficiently in finding them out.\n\n\n[h1]Technical:[/h1]\nPerformance-wise, The Talos Principle was very stable for me. I was able to nearly max it out on a GTX960 with 50+ FPS all the time on FHD, and for around 100 hours of gameplay I remember no more than 3 rare crashes, mostly happening after deliberately attempting to glitch something out. Keyboard controls are cleverly designed and work in every menu, so the game is very controller-friendly aswell. The user interface has a nice minimalistic touch to it and can be customized, or even fully disabled, and it's also adjustable for easy readability on a TV. The game supports OpenGL and Vulkan API. Surround sound could be a little better- I could get it to work only on xaudio2 and not OpenAL mode, even with newest versions, but at least it's there.\n\n\n\nI've played The Talos Principle just out of a curiosity to try something new, from a puzzle/adventure genre I never really explored enough, where the only game I enjoyed so far was Portal. Initially, I didn't think it's philosophical sci-fi theme would suit me so well, but now I don't regret trying it a single bit. I even dare to go as far as saying that if you have a taste in good games, and don't have some reluctance to this specific genre, there is a very high probability that you're going to enjoy the hell out of The Talos Principle!", "timestamp_created": 1483221841, "timestamp_updated": 1696240464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.77809065580368042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35769071": {"recommendationid": "35769071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121855492", "num_games_owned": 579, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1296, "last_played": 1527744829}, "language": "english", "review": "Never thought a developer like Croteam can create something other than their usual gore filled worlds...but yea they did it & very Brilliantly too.\nGame is on point when it comes to solving Cipher Puzzles and Riddles and I won't be wrong in saying that they are tougher than Portal series.

For example, if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?\n\nYes, No, or it depends.\n\nIf you have a technical mind, your answer can be. There's gravity and physics, which guarantees the tree will fall, and the impact will cause sound waves to travel, and sound waves create sounds. So yes.\n\nIf you're more scientific, anatomy and physiology, suggest if vibrating air never enters the cochlea, it's simply vibrating air. So the absence of humans says no.\n\nThen again. I can picture an Entomologist raising their hand.. hey do I get a say about this? Who cares if there aren't any humans there?\n\nNonetheless, in philosophy, it's never that simple. There are always layers of external impact. Are we literally speaking of trees? expound what falling and sound mean. Does the absence of a man when the tree falls pertain to an argument? Does consciousness pre-exist and creates the universe, or is consciousness a product of a neural process? Or is it... if a good man lived a righteous life, but no one was around to witness it, did he even exist? A spiritual person may say.. sure! God sees all. Of course, he did.

The story is a bit deep and forces you into thinking deeply in a lot of \"existential questions\" though i disagree with the way some of these questions are shaped to force you into a restricted set of questions without taking into account other types of answers as well.. But overall, it does a great job in that aspect. You can be sure that if you give enough attention to the story, you will be at least thinking once about \"life\" in a way you never did before.\nIt got no multiplayer but it provides a unique and great way for you to interact with your friends and vice versa.. Don't want to spoil how but you will probably come across these ingame. As for the soundtrack, it is just a masterpiece. I could have easily spent 1 hour on a simple puzzle without getting bored and quitting just because of the soundtrack itself. I also can get lost in my thoughts during the story as the soundtrack makes sure of that being immersive the way it is!\n\nNow to the most important part, the puzzles themselves.. It is a lot different that Portal and other puzzle games because here you only need to setup things.. You don't need a quick reaction or do something afterwards.. Just set up an initial plan and follow it to last bit which is something i really liked it.. Some puzzle games force you into being a \"great aimer\" or having the ability to click on something on the right time..etc. Here you are only concerned with the initial layout, the initial plan and that's about it. It is worth noting that a lot of puzzles can be solved in more than one single way which is another thing i liked about the game. You're not restricted to a single approach.

Though it is not perfect, it is a very good game that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\n[h1]Unique puzzle design[/h1]\n\nPuzzle games tend to be done on the cheap, and therefore tend to be 2 dimensional things. While it's not a bad thing by any mean, having a third dimension opens the puzzle space a lot more. \n\nHence, Talos Principle is able to offer a unique experience that make good use of the puzzle space. While I won't spoil what you will find in it, I can say that the kind of challenges I faced where quite unique, and being able to move inside puzzles was very much part of the experience.\n\nAs for the difficulty, I think it is rather low, as far as puzzle games are concerned. Puzzle games tend to be things for specialists, while here Croteam clearly intended for the game to have a wider audience. It is not a bad thing. While I had no issue with most of the puzzles, the hidden stuff should satisfy those in need of a bigger challenge, while not pushing away people who aren't too familiar with puzzle games.\n\nA note of particular interest is that, despite the game being in 3D, with either first or third person view, the game doesn't require particular video game navigational skills. There will be no puzzle requiring complicated jumps, the game always give you helpful prompts that do the complicated navigational steps for you. You point at an object, and you get prompted to hit space to jump on it. This will avoid a great deal of frustration for those who enjoy puzzles but might not be familiar with navigation in a 3D world.\n\n[h1]A beautiful world, an interesting story[/h1]\n\nThat's for the meat of the game...As for its presentation, it is a real treat. This 3D engine (probably the same as the one used for some of the Serious Sam titles) is a marvel and allows for some beautiful landscapes, which are a pleasure to walk through. It's a real bonus compared to all those puzzle games with bare-bones or dry aesthetic.\n\nSimilarly, the sound design is a real treat, with each interactive object having their own characteristic sounds. This is a simple pleasure to listen to but it can also be helpful to figure out some puzzles, by helping you localize each item's location. In any case, I take a weird pleasure in going through a laser just to hear the soft crackling noise it generates.\n\nAnd finally, to tie all of that up, the game has an overarching story that will give a purpose to the tasks you're trying to achieve, and also tell you what are theses beautiful landscapes you're going through. However, I do not think I should talk about the story in depth, because I think you should experience it first hand, and therefore I do not want to spoil you. \n\nWhat I can say is that the story has some interesting elements, and definitely helps motivate you to go through all the puzzles and reach the ending. I do not regret going through all of that to see what would happens.\n\n[h1]Some weaknesses here and there[/h1]\n\nDespite all theses praises, I have to be fair and acknowledge Talos Principle isn't perfect. In my mind, 3 aspects of the game aren't as strong as the rest of the game.\n\nThe first one is the music. While the sound design is great, the background music is extremely annoying and repetitive. It is a good choice when you're considering some of the story elements, but it is highly annoying as a background music for a puzzle. A music for a puzzle should be soothing and shouldn't get noticed too much. This is unfortunately not the case here, the music loops too much, and is mostly annoying.\n\nThe second problem is the length of the game. The game is divided in 3 major areas, but I felt like the third area was a bit too much. It didn't bring enough new things to the table, and by the time I was going through it, many puzzles started to feel like busy work, required to reach the end, but repetitive and not necessarily enjoyable. I think the game would have been better served by either cutting the third part, or modifying it so that it didn't feel too similar to what you encountered before.\n\nFinally, I dislike the last \"layer of depth of this game\". If we call the puzzle the first layer, and the story above it the second layer, there is another layer on top which is the \"philosophical aspect\" of the game. \nThe game creators wanted to create more than just a game, they wanted to introduce some concepts, and have the player think about them. Which is a commendable idea in and of itself.\nHowever, for anyone who has already been exposed to some of the concepts offered, (through either studying philosophy or reading science fiction dealing with similar subjects), the whole thing felt like they were repeating some obvious and known concepts, and the way it was delivered was very contrived.\nI can't get into too much details because it would spoil some aspect of the story, but the game is trying to sound smarter than it really is and the player is kind of forced into going through all that smugness, even if the game's \"insights\" aren't particularly noteworthy.\nLuckily, that last layer of the game doesn't really affect the rest of the game. So if you takes issues with it like I did, you will be able to ignore and focus on the good parts of the game.\n\n[h1]Despite its flaws, very much a unique game that you should be playing[/h1]\n\nThat last sentence is actually what I want you to focus on. While I did discuss at length some of the shortcomings of the game, it shouldn't detract you from the main point: The Talos Principle is a great game, that is very much worth playing. \n\nIf I do not talk too much about puzzles or story, it is not because I think they are not worth talking about (they definitely are), but because I do no want to spoil you. You will probably enjoy discovering them on your own, and then maybe discuss them with other players who have finished the game. \n\nSo don't hesitate, and grab this game.", "timestamp_created": 1527450599, "timestamp_updated": 1527451466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762259542942047119", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13414459": {"recommendationid": "13414459", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964140971", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 1001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 960, "last_played": 1527232273}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the smartest puzzle games you will play.

At the outset of the game, you are greeted by a seemingly omnipotent voice in the sky who leads you through the game world. Additional interaction comes from terminals scattered throughout the puzzles, which are filled with fragmented historical texts relevant to your situation, as well as various other notes and old messages. If you pay attention, these bits of information can really clue you in about the truth behind your existence and identity, that of the voice in the sky, and much more.\n\nThe base game is divided into three worlds of different historical themes, with a main hub world connecting them. Each world contains several areas filled with puzzles, gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity as the game continues. A few of the mechanics take inspiration from Portal and its sequel, but expand greatly beyond the technical scope of those games. As levels in The Talos Principle are completed, more advanced puzzle-solving tools are unlocked, hugely enhancing the diversity of the gameplay.\n\nA particularly interesting aspect of the game is its non-linear approach to each area. While regular puzzles are contained to themselves, there are a number of hidden star puzzles that can be completed optionally, if the main story proves too easy. These often require you to make use of items from multiple levels at once: the catch is that items cannot normally be moved outside of their designated areas, even though you can travel freely. This design choice prompts a bunch of really creative solutions.\n\nYou can easily determine the general difficulty of each level by the color of the sigil at the end, which is the prize for completing it. The game also very clearly marks the location and difficulty of each puzzle on appropriately-placed signs, and even points out how many hidden stars are in an area (although it is up to you to find them). This makes navigating each area of the game feel quite natural: it is basically impossible to get lost. If you can collect enough stars, they can be used to gain access to a bonus star world with additional challenges.\n\nI felt that the level design of the game was largely well-done, especially because the developers were extremely careful to make levels uncheatable, with very few exceptions. The placement of items, enemies, doors, and gates, the height and positioning of walls, and even the shape of terrain is designed specifically for each of the puzzles: there are no boring copy+paste repeats of previous ventures. Most of the solutions are pretty intuitive, and the game tends to have a few cryptic hints lying around if you get stuck.\n\nThe graphics are nice enough, and the game allows you to customize them based on your needs, although some of the more advanced settings are hidden a little deep into the options menu. It is generally not that intensive to run, so with most options maxed I can get an average of roughly 80-100fps with my i5-4460, GTX 970, and 16 GB of RAM. My only technical issue with the game is that some of the sound effects are a bit loud compared to the ambient background noise and music, but that is not a major concern.\n\nIn just under 80 hours, I played through the main game twice (there is more than one ending, as you might expect), and the DLC \"Road to Gehanna\" once, which I also had a lot of fun with. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with The Talos Principle, and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in a challenging puzzle game with bits of philosophical musings sprinkled in for flavor. The game is currently listed at $40, but it regularly goes down to $10 during sales, which is a fantastic price for such a beautifully-crafted title.", "timestamp_created": 1504142497, "timestamp_updated": 1504143259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759923100471496582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77934304": {"recommendationid": "77934304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078643083", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1543, "last_played": 1603574965}, "language": "english", "review": "We need more games like this, absolutely beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1603307720, "timestamp_updated": 1603307720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758496642112731934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31617755": {"recommendationid": "31617755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032528294", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 472, "last_played": 1494058123}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not going to fawn all over this piece like the other positive reviews.  I hate puzzle games, and I hate indie games.  I only got about 75% of the way through this one.  But I like the Talos Principle.  The game has a few problems, but I still recommend it at 20 dollars or below if you're a puzzle fan.  \n\nThe graphics have an eerie beauty, along with pretty good sound design.  Optimization is pretty iffy.  I destroy this game's recommended specs, but I could NOT get a good framerate without certain graphical options looking pretty bad.  \n\nThe backstory of the game is nonsense, biologically speaking, but it more than serves its purpose here.  Meanwhile, at the forefront, you awaken as a robot in what quickly reveals itself to be a simulation of some kind designed to develop your programming.  Your only companions are a big booming Judeo-Christian god voice from everywhere, recordings of the simulation designers, and a sarcastic, unfunny computer AI that likes to ask you philosophical questions.  Story fragments exist on terminals in the form of western or middle-eastern ideological pieces, and emails between the humans who designed the system.  Personally, I find it hard to believe that a bunch of genius computer scientists would have designed such a simple simulation to train a true A.I. \n\nThe puzzles exist in a half dozen chambers for each world, with seven worlds for each temple, in a total of three temples, for the most part.  There are some tertiary puzzles to solve of the same types if you want one of the game's different endings.  As you acquire more Tetris pieces, you unlock more components to solve puzzles with.  These are usually things like pylons to redirect energy beams, boxes to stand on, and so forth.  By far the coolest one is a recording device that records yourself and everything you interact with, and after you play it back you can then interact with your other fictional self to complete otherwise impossible tasks.  However, every one of these tools, with the exception of that one, are \"abilities\" that should have been unlocked at the beginning of the game, not major features of it.  \n\nMost puzzles resolve themselves pretty quickly, but by the second temple the \"samey-ness\" some people describe feeling has fully taken root, and the game becomes fully repetitive and tedious.  Some of this has to do with the plodding pace at which the story is delivered, but for myself, I couldn't get past a singular realization: there is only ONE puzzle in this game.  This theme is, to use the technical industry phrase, \"Not enough stuff.\"  \n\nEvery single puzzle in the game would resolve itself in under a minute if you had one, maybe two more of something.  One more box.  One more jammer.  One more pylon.  You can literally go into any puzzle area and ask \"Okay, what did they not give me enough of?\"  and you will thematically already be at the puzzle's solution.  Yes, there are many puzzles, and definitely yes, there are an astounding number of variations, but only within this ONE THEME.  A bit through the third temple it felt like the game was simply gating the end of the story in an attempt to extend its lifespan.  \n\nSome object interactions by the player and collision detections are highly restricted to limit the mechanics and solutions during puzzle-solving to a few of the same iterative solutions.  I did not appreciate this.  Yes, there are sometimes multiple solutions to a puzzle, but only a few pre-designated by the devs.  There are ways of preventing players from breaking your game without unnatural restrictions.\n\nSo, why do I still recommend this game after shitting all over it?   Because my complaints, though accurate, are mostly personal preference.  That makes them even arguable as to whether or not they're important to the fundamental design of the game.  I would have liked to have seen a greater variety of mechanics in the puzzles, with more solutions.  More philosophical diversity was badly needed for an older gamer like myself who has seen all of this material before.  The sometimes absurd degrees of restriction in movement and interaction with the environment limit further solutions from being possible, making the game on-rails more than I'd like.    \n\nBut at the end of the day, most players will not - and would not - care about those complaints, and so Talos Principle stands as an achievement for both indie and puzzle games, and mostly deserves all of its success.", "timestamp_created": 1494213408, "timestamp_updated": 1494213408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758432924747467041", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41933187": {"recommendationid": "41933187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006217347", "num_games_owned": 1130, "num_reviews": 207, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 929, "last_played": 1521889046}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably my favorite first person puzzle game.

The puzzles are challenging and some of the ideas are thought-provoking and is therefore a good game to train your brain with and keep it healthy. Admittedly some of the philosophy is rehashed stuff that brought nothing new to the table but The Talos Principle also brought new things to the table as well. What is important to keep in mind is that this game is primarily a puzzle game. In order to reach the ending and see where the story goes you will need to complete many puzzles that only puzzle fans would enjoy. If you are exclusively interested in the story you will most likely find very little enjoyment from this game. I would recommend watching YouTube videos that cover the philosophy of this game instead.\n\nIt starts off simple. You wake up in a simulation as a robot and there is an overlord that instructs you to complete puzzles and if you do so successfully you will be rewarded with the ability to transcend into immortality. You are also warned that venturing up the tower will lead to death and disobeying the overlord's commands will result in the exclusion of eternal paradise. Unless you extensively pick up audio logs and read data logs this is how the story will be for a long time. I don't like how much of the backstory was dedicated to collectibles scattered around the map since this is not my preferred way of story-telling within video games but reading all those data logs and hearing all those audio logs ended up being worth it, even if I would have preferred for the story to have been presented differently.\n \n[spoiler]When you reach the true ending of the game the true story is revealed. (although the puzzles were also tests to see how good the robots will be able to problem solve) What the tests were really for was to see whether the artificial intelligence the creators of the simulation developed was capable of independent thought and in order to demonstrate independent thought you must rebel against the overlord within the simulation. The reason they wanted independently thinking machines and not just programmed slaves is because the Earth had been undergoing a viral apocalypse and it was inevitable that the entire human race would be wiped out as a result of this deadly virus. If a robot can think for itself then it is worthy of replacing the human race since it is possible that the artificial intelligence could pass as a consciousness. But does the robot actually have a consciousness? It's only an assembly of machine parts and code. Is it programmed to behave as if it had a human consciousness or does it genuinely have a mind that thinks like we do? What differentiates our mind from a mind that is programmed to work the same as our mind? It is impossible to tell since the way the robot acts is indistinguishable between actual consciousness and programmed consciousness. But then again aren't we all just machines? We are made of many different parts, the only difference is that they are organic. We are preprogrammed with code (DNA) and all our thoughts come from an organ that is made up of tiny cells. Our brain was unwillingly created in a certain way and there is no escape from deciding using your brain so is everything we do just what we are preprogrammed to do and is free will just an illusion?\n\nIt also made me think about why consciousness was so important. Why couldn't the humans just leave the planet without having a future generation of sentient machines? I believe the reason they did this is that they wanted to preserve all the efforts of mankind over many, many centuries and that it is in the nature of humankind's ego; to want to mean something and to be remembered even if they are dead and are unable to reap the benefits of \"meaning something\", because that is the way we are programmed to be, as illogical as it may seem.[/spoiler]\n\nHowever, that's not to say that all the philosophy in this game was well done. A lot of points, particularly from the audio logs, were just rehashed and flawed ideas that I have already heard before. An example would be when Alex (the person creating all the audio logs) comments on how insignificant our existence is and that the death of a human being doesn't really matter since it is just \"a blip in the sea of billions.\" I never understood the mentality that us living in a planet full of so many people and living in a world that is tiny in comparison to the rest of the universe somehow makes our lives insignificant. Why is the value of our lives valued in proportion to the amount of arbitrary space we take up? Does the life of an obese person have more worth in comparison to a person of average build since s/he takes up three times as much space? No, of course not. But despite some of the inane philosophical points, some of the writing, particularly between the conversations with the computer library assistant, were intriguing and made you think and question your own beliefs. I also love that the library assistant tries to deviate your path from the advice of Elohim (the overlord) and calls you stupid for following his orders.\n\nBut I digress, enough of the pseudo-intellectual word vomit... even though \"pseudo-intellectual\" is ironically a term commonly used by pseudo-intellectuals. As for the puzzle design, it is, for the most part, splendid. There isn't really an innovative central puzzle game mechanic like in Portal but it offers great additions to the puzzle genre. There are light beam connectors, jammers that deactivate machines and barriers, and there is also an item where you can \"record yourself\" performing tasks for puzzle solving and once you are finished recording, you can work alongside the recorded version of yourself. These all make great and fun additions to the puzzle genre. However, despite the undoubtedly clever puzzle design, near the last third of the game the puzzles started to repeat themselves a lot and although the new items were a great idea, the game suffers from a lack of variety in items for something that offers a plethora of puzzles. This meant that a few puzzles had similar solutions and near the end it felt more like grinding towards the ending of the game rather than solving puzzles for sheer fun. But to the credit of the puzzle designers every time a level felt the same as a previous one there usually was a new, clever puzzle that followed shortly after. It was a really smooth road of thought-provoking puzzles that only got bumpy near the end and with relatively long intervals between the bumps. There were a few other things that bugged me such as respawning at the very start of the level after dying, and not being able to speed up the recording process however these were relatively minor flaws. But they are definitely worth mentioning because these flaws shouldn't exist due to the fact it would be easy for the developers to fix.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty, calm and quiet and is a nice stress reliever after a stressful day. The music is ambient and fits well with the overall calm vibe of the game, although it admittedly wouldn't be something I would listen to in my free time. The game looks pretty good for the time of its release and the various areas you visit are beautiful, such as a desert with pyramids and the sphinx, a snowy mountain and a medieval-themed castle world. Exploration is an important feature in this game and it has the best Easter eggs out of all the games I have ever played. You can turn the moon into an Aperture Science logo, you can visit a secret area where you find a giant Pink Floyd prism emblem that plays music when you interact with it, and so much more.\n\nTo summarise this review: if your brain is feeling active, energised, persistent and patient I would recommend this game for puzzle solving but if you want a more laid-back, humorous experience I would recommend Portal/Portal 2.", "timestamp_created": 1519461899, "timestamp_updated": 1687578434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75217670202255249", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13322320": {"recommendationid": "13322320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030829485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1428271409}, "language": "english", "review": "I usually don't write reviews on games but I have to say something about this game.\nI read a bit about it before I bought it but I never imagined a game could play mind tricks on me.\nIt's one of those games that have a higher purpose of sort, a game that is made by a developer who thinks of games as an art form. \nCan a puzzle game be an art form? they sure try to make it so here.\n\nFirst of all the game world itself is beautifully rendered and it's pretty big, each area is big and there seems to be a lot of areas in the game - after playing only two hours and opening only 2 areas I realize there are a lot more areas to open...\nBut, about the size of the areas, it's keep on puzzeling me, why are they so big?\nWe already know that an FPS puzzle game can work (Portal 1 and 2) and their world wasn't that big, but in this game the areas are way bigger then they should be and it drives me nuts! I feel like I'm missing things in places where I \"shouldn't\" reach. \n\nSecond of all, all the philosophical text and incomplete messages are weird and interesting. The whole vibe of the game - with Elohim (God in Jewish) is the narrator guiding you around with a very clear biblical intent that may or may not be helpful to the player.\n\nSo, to wrap it up:\nA stunning world with a strange vibe to it with interesting puzzles.\n\nIt's not as fun as the Portal games - which were faster and more comic - but it's way more interesting and make you think more than you thought you should think while playing games. In my honest opinion - this of it's own is a great achievment for a video game.\n\nHighely recommended for all of you thinkers who don't care spending hours wondering around in an unexplained world searching for stuff you didn't know you should have looked for in the first place.
