I completed story mode and the other achievements a few years back and just couldn't hit the last stage least time after many tries.  Took a break since that. \n\nRecently completing the gauntlet speed run achievement in Titanfall 2 gave me confidence to come back and try this one again.  After hours of practice,  I finally made it and now I'm really happy.  Next long outstanding achievement will be the speedrun achievement for Braid, I guess. \n\nBy the way, this game gave me a 3D motion sickness that I had never experienced in other games.  It was very common to lose sense of direction after passing through portals.  Probably not suitable for players prone to 3D motion sickness. \n", "timestamp_created": 1673155056, "timestamp_updated": 1673155056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 2,

[/h1]\n\nI'm just writing a review for this game because of the OCD; in a perfect world, literally everyone and their grandma know what Portal is... Let me start by just saying that I have an interpretation of this whole thing.\n\nMaybe it's just me who feels this way, and maybe it's because they are all Valve games, but what if Portal takes places actually in the same world as Left 4 Dead (OR Half-Life, which is basically an Alien-induced apocalypse instead). That's right: in portal, you are this test subject, Chell, who is directed by a sentient robot AI into taking tests in Aperture Labs, to ultimately see how humans can deal with an apocalyptic scenario using the Portal guns.... That apocalyptic scenario being the same one in Left 4 Dead, a zombie apocalypse.. This theory of mine should be up to debate in Valve HQ, but I digress!\n\nIn Portal, you take the role of Chell, guided by the sentient robot AI Glados to complete a set of trials... using a portal gun, that allows traversal from point A to point B! You guessed it, it's a puzzle game divided into 19 levels, and a bunch of extra challenge maps for you to completely fry your brains while trying. After the 19 trials, Shell decides it's enough to leave the Aperture Labs for good and face the world above but Glados tries to stop her, saying that \"We are not ready yet!\" (half-confirming my theory). There is a whole actual mythos surrounding Glados, Aperture Science Labs and the Portal gun and surprisingly, a cake! The portal gun allows shall to maneuver through the levels while trying to avoid laser guns, and machine guns... and in the end, there's a major cliffhanger that sets the tone for the second game of the series.\n\nIn Portal, the puzzles are quite easy, it's the challenges that will have you rage, but they are all trial and error material, which means the more you play them, the more efficient you'd become at them. Portal is a [b]10/10[/b] puzzle game with very cryptic lore that would have you formulate theories inside of your mind, especially if you've played other Valve titles. It should be in a \"Steam beginner's kit\" or something, alongside games like Half-Life, Left 4 Dead, Payday and possibly Team Fortress... I can't shake the feeling that at least a couple of those games are directly related to Portal... Hummm, it remains to be seen I guess. Maybe Left 4 Dead 3 with the portal gun??

This is not something on my account from some seedy method, if you google \"siblinghood portal\" my speedrun.com page is at the top of the results and my high hour count is relatively known in the community.  This may change at some point, but at the time of writing I am the most qualified reviewer of portal possible, and I plan to take this responsibility as seriously as I can muster.\n\nPortal was a marvel of technology at release.  Many design decisions had to be made due to technological limitations at the time.  It started development in 2005 and the task of programming to realize the vision for the game was a much more complex problem than perhaps any other game at the time.  Many corners had to be cut.  For one example, because the player's collision box is a rectangular prism that doesn't rotate, when walls don't run parallel to axes of the coordinate grid, they have different collision experiences with the player than you would intuitively expect.  You can see the impact of this in the level design.  The vast majority of surfaces in the game are parallel to two axes of the coordinate grids, making everything rectangular.  The portals themselves are also not eliptical on a mechanical level, they are rectangles, which you can feel for yourself once you've heard it.  Limitations in creation breed creative workarounds, and arbitrarily restricting the tools available to you is a technique you can see thoughout all artistic endeavors.  I believe this same concept applies in the case of Portal.  Its minimalist aesthetic and themes are enhanced by these circumstantial limitations, and don't, as one might initally assume, take away from its value today.\n", "timestamp_created": 1685167000, "timestamp_updated": 1685167000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6841697096824646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136547364": {"recommendationid": "136547364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053976234", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1693665347}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1681252884, "timestamp_updated": 1681252884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684089243412017822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142399211": {"recommendationid": "142399211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158437109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1030, "last_played": 1689765057}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Sweet cake[/h1]\n\nMaybe I should have written a review a long time ago. Although it\u2019s a fairly well-known game, well who hasn\u2019t played this wonderful and sweet game. It be noticeable for its puzzle gameplay, portals, a good story, and soundtrack. Every time I play it, it's like getting a piece of cake after deciphering a puzzle; and the whole cake when I finish the game. I'll say a few brief things about [[u]insert the name of the game[/u]] while I finish my cake. I\u2019d be keen on to underline three substantial elements of the game: the gameplay, the characters as the plot, and the soundtrack.\n\n[h1]Welcome to Aperture Laboratories: a science of portals[/h1]\n\nThe simplicity and modesty of a game is usually the perfect recipe for a story like an impressive game. This is how it welcomes us with its minimalist style but with a whodunit enclosed within the Aperture complex.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty unpretentious: I have to try to succeed the test, go from A to B using cubes or spheres of energy that, placed on buttons, activate doors. Everything seems acceptable, a classic puzzle and escape room game. But what happens if there are hurdles that don\u2019t permit me to take the cube? Hence an original intention of the game: the use of portals. In order not to address in detail, it\u2019s enough to know that a device permits opening portals, A and B, with which I can make a path. Of course as long as the walls allot such a portal to be placed. I find the clues as signs, outlines or symbols indicate me what I can do and what I\u2019ll hit upon there. In this way it guides a possible action for the player to do. It goes from the basic to the complex.\n\nThe game has fun logic that puts the brain to work. The enjoyable is to discover various ways to solve a puzzle to proceed in the plot. Furthermore, it has a stimulating physics simulation, in which through portals I can achieve a boost thanks to the acceleration (the momentum) caused by the fall. That way I can accomplish great distances or heights. Or just experience a free fall through portals, the terminal velocity, which makes it fun. I can only tell you that a test room has its limits, there\u2019re assorted obstacles and the best each room escalates its difficulty. But always \u2014something that distinguishes [i]Valve[/i]\u2014 it has its didactic pathway in which I learn little by little. It\u2019s simple that can become multifarious ([i]vid. et.[/i] challenge mode).\n\n[h1]The silent science between GLaDOS and Chell[/h1]\n\nWhat I discerned, something that was to my penchant, the plot happens in a hermetic way. Everything ensues inside Aperture, whose staging combines minimalism (testing room) and industrial style (facility). As for the portals, optical illusions, perception and perspectives of space play a role.  Nevertheless, being secluded, although always fleetingly noticing a context that connects it, it tells the story of a lassie named Chell. Like any other day, she wakes up from her glass-walled room, the timer counting down, the music on the radio on, ready to carry out the test. A portal opens. Suddenly, something or someone alters the AI and she, unnoticed, tries to escape in routes that have already been explored by someone.\n\nThe story develops as I surpass the tests, at each step it becomes thought-provoking and well-planned plot. It\u2019s intriguing, and it always tries to catch the player as if it didn't want us to leave. Every detail is meticulously pondering. I embodied into a test subject, though she\u2019s always silent (comparable to Gordon Freeman). Instead, GLaDOS will be an opposite character, \u00absomeone\u00bb outgoing, sarcastic, sincere, and with a personality who\u2019ll be talking the entire time on the walkthrough. It's those kind of villains with temperament you love and hate. Although sometimes that one intrigues being a voyeur almost all the instance in a world where there aren't many humans apparently. \n\nThe narrative is also visual, where each detail tells a part of the story: sci-fi, enigmatic and airtight. Everything has personality, even the robot turrets that are charmingly lethal. What\u2019s fun and, at the same time, petrifying is the supposed relationship that the antagonist links with the protagonist. It\u2019ll clearly be noticeable in the song that closes the game. It's a perfect way to tie everything together: storytelling, gameplay, and soundtrack.\n\n[h1]A cake for those who still alive[/h1]\n\nOne of the best pieces of music in video games is the [i]Still Alive[/i] song. It was written by Jonathan Coulton and performed by Ellen McLain. With an indie rock style, it reveals the sweet sincerity of the antagonist. He affirms that he hasn\u2019t died but at the same time being an AI he expresses his feelings. It\u2019s an emotional song, with a thought-provoking content with its humour and, at the same time, a frankness that is hard to forget.\n\nEllen's voice has been very sympathetic and friendly, she gives that sweet human tone to robotic part of the antagonist. Being her the voice that tests us, comments and expresses throughout the game. While on the radio it can be listen to in a samba version. It\u2019s an excellent conclusion through music, where the voice of the antagonist and the melody of the song converge.\n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t the merely piece of music, it can be also perceived the dark ambient composition in many parts of the plot. It was composed by Kelly Bailey and Mike Morasky. The purpose of the soundtrack is to provide an atmosphere absorbed on a world dominated by computers. In this way I noticed its base of the dark ambient and giving off an enigmatic and synthetic atmosphere. For this, they merged ambient drone styles with minimalist piano and chip tune, with which it emphasizes such music was composed by a computer. Using arpeggios and mangled tones, prolonging towards downtempo, thus expresses odd, ethereal, and ominous sounds. It certainly contrasts an artificial music well done with an indie rock song that expresses the human side. It\u2019s therefore an incredible, shocking and enjoyable soundtrack.\n\n[h1]Cupcake[/h1]\n\nGiven its time, the game was thought to be durable due to the difficulty of each puzzle as well as the series of challenges. Although that will depend on the player. Without contemplating the diversity of possibilities to solve the puzzle, the game is short, but with a good plot and it\u2019s quite re-playable. You can always discover new things along the way, which makes the game like a cupcake as a reward for playing it. It\u2019s worth remembering the game as a classic in its style.\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1689765998, "timestamp_updated": 1689765998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684059321880340576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125041410": {"recommendationid": "125041410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092034210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1644097762}, "language": "english", "review": "There is no cake.", "timestamp_created": 1667732785, "timestamp_updated": 1667732785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68364948034286499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123596136": {"recommendationid": "123596136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237198954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1665290956}, "language": "english", "review": "A true masterpiece in all aspects.

Still the game holds up and I would still recommend this to people who like a different kind of puzzle game before i recommend the harder games like mentioned above\n\nPros\n- Probably the first that created this genre of games(which i like)\n- Great use of mechanics\n\nCons\n- Too short ( Portal 2 is the reason why)\n", "timestamp_created": 1693128234, "timestamp_updated": 1693128234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595959603786468506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128437362": {"recommendationid": "128437362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160915260", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 84068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_at_review": 63051, "last_played": 1696300682}, "language": "english", "review": "mid", "timestamp_created": 1670867047, "timestamp_updated": 1670867047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589509665966033936", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127624280": {"recommendationid": "127624280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074660874", "num_games_owned": 4431, "num_reviews": 418, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 762, "last_played": 1446131515}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the few good games that run smoothly on onboard graphics.", "timestamp_created": 1669808480, "timestamp_updated": 1669808480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588995933532714844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138126592": {"recommendationid": "138126592", "author": {"steamid": "76561199038626438", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1683787373}, "language": "english", "review": "you wanna know what else is delicious and moist? \ud83d\ude0f", "timestamp_created": 1683787425, "timestamp_updated": 1683787425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58844369649887085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136748112": {"recommendationid": "136748112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078729385", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1627775336}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with great history, graphics still hold up today and the game itself is a very enjoyable experience which puts your brain to work a little bit. 100% would recommend buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1681573385, "timestamp_updated": 1681573385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588014960289001465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145782559": {"recommendationid": "145782559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264002466", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1692110956}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic game", "timestamp_created": 1694003993, "timestamp_updated": 1694003993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587326407432556152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135019080": {"recommendationid": "135019080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299285150", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 936, "last_played": 1678686890}, "language": "english", "review": "First playthrough review time.\n\nPortal is a unique puzzle game where players need to create portals to achieve in game goals and destinations.

You owe it to yourself to play it (and its sequel) if you tend to enjoy environmental puzzles. \nIt's also worth noting that both Portal games go on sale for dirt cheap relatively frequently.\n\nTalking about story, there is an interesting one to be found here even if it's left voluntarily vague for the most part. It feels Portal knows exactly when it should talk and when it should shut up so that you may take in its environments and ambience, letting Portal's peculiar atmosphere may seep in.\n\nPortal 1 is what I'd consider short and sweet, it does leave you wanting more, but luckily with its sequel there's no shortage of more Portal to sink your teeth in. \nIf you're someone that aims for 100% completion however, there are a couple of challenges that you can take on, one of which requires that you play the game again at least one more time looking for collectibles.\n\nThe other far more interesting challenge is a collection of six selected levels which individually test your skills in completing them with: least amount portals shot, fastest time, and least steps taken. The requirements for time and portals start to get a little unreasonable with chamber 15, the only challenge I found actually found to be actually unreasonable though is the \"least steps taken\" one, it's just not well thought out and I don't think it really fits the puzzle game nature of Portal at all unlike the other two.\n\nWhether you want to just play the story and be done with it or try and 100% complete the game one thing's certain, Portal is a game that stood the test of time and that's worth playing even 16 years after its original release (at the time of writing).",

In 2023, however, it is difficult to find individual merits that its sequel, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/]Portal 2[/url], doesn't do better. Portal with RTX came out at the latter end of 2022, and it's a cool gimmick, but doesn't change anything except appearances. Even then, not only are many gamers unable to try it anytime soon (lmao @ GPU prices and Steam hardware charts), but Portal 2 doesn't look comparatively bad without ray tracing capabilities. The only way it excels over its successor is in atmospheric horror elements. This is partly because it's a shorter game and these elements are much more concentrated, but also because the tone of its storytelling is less whimsical than Portal 2 and more reminiscent of Half Life. I will personally never forget the infamous \"Rat Man\" and those stujspid fjuKIcNg radios. Speaking of which, the achievements in this game - one of which involves taking radios that are scattered about the map into particular positions - are incredibly frustrating. I had some stupid input/control issues in all of the chamber 18 challenges where my camera would lock and then shake like a diabetic on low blood sugar when I tried to move it in the mid-air sections. Furthermore, the fuickNING sutpid least steps challenge category in general is the worst designed thing I have ever seen for a Source game. Honestly, this iteration of the fuhcciin Source engine holds it back so much, worst of all being that there's no proper borderless windowed mode.\n\nAll that being said, if you were to take this game in a vacuum, it is still a very good game; it's Still Alive, if you will :^). Figuring out how to gain enough momentum to make a particular jump, maneuvering balls of energy to power on switches, working against a timer to quickly place your portals, and moreover just solving the puzzles correctly will fill you with typical puzzle game joy. The game and the gameplay loop flow well, and are only interrupted by the usual Source engine idiosyncrasies or optional content. \n\nIt's short and it's sweet, but I believe there are better confections to seek in the now-identically-priced sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1669620552, "timestamp_updated": 1694663517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131428469": {"recommendationid": "131428469", "author": {"steamid": "76561199041137717", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1100, "last_played": 1674512089}, "language": "english", "review": "The cake is a lie :(", "timestamp_created": 1674512444, "timestamp_updated": 1674512444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540229856967926025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142174549": {"recommendationid": "142174549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836331185", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1798, "last_played": 1625517073}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Portal [/h1]\n[hr]\n[code] It would be greatly appreciated if you would rate this review with a prize, although it is not necessary.

After doing several tests we will gradually realize that not everything we have been told is true and if you investigate well you will find out extra information that will help you understand everything that is happening.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[hr]\nThe gameplay is very clean, there are no unnecessarily difficult levels (in the story mode), we will try different mechanics through the portals, carrying objects from one place to another, occupying the acceleration of the fall to reach a higher place and many other mechanics. As a player who completes it 100% having to do all the challenges, for all the time I invested in them I say that they are a real challenge, there are several modes, one where you have to spend the least amount of time, another in which which one you have to occupy the fewest number of portals and finally one where you have to occupy the fewest number of steps. In each challenge you have to think a lot about the strategy in order to have enough time to be able to get the best time, making you think a lot until you reach the strategy in which you can achieve

Portal, developed by Valve, is a mind-bending puzzle game that has left players scratching their heads and laughing out loud since its release. So buckle up, because this review will take you on a journey through portals, puzzles, and plenty of witty humor.\n\nGameplay and Puzzles:\nAt its core, Portal is a game about thinking with portals \u2013 a concept that's more intriguing than watching a cat chase a laser pointer. Armed with a portal gun, you'll navigate through a series of test chambers, where the laws of physics bend like a contortionist in a circus. The puzzles start out simple, but soon enough, you'll be scratching your head like a confused monkey in a lab coat.\n\nEach puzzle is a delightful mix of creative problem-solving and spatial awareness, challenging you to think outside the box \u2013 or, in this case, with portals. You'll feel like a scientific wizard, conjuring up portals to fling yourself across chasms and outsmart turrets like a stealthy ninja.\n\nGLaDOS and Humor:\nAh, GLaDOS \u2013 the AI overlord with a penchant for dark humor and passive-aggressive compliments. Her witty remarks are as sharp as a diamond-edged portal, and her voice is as mesmerizing as a siren's song. Be prepared for her playful taunts and sarcastic quips, because she'll keep you company throughout your journey like an entertaining but slightly sinister tour guide.\n\nThe humor in Portal is a delightful surprise, bringing levity to the mind-bending puzzles. It's like finding a cupcake in a room filled with deadly lasers \u2013 a pleasant and unexpected treat. Whether it's the witty banter from GLaDOS or the hilarious observations found scribbled on walls, the game's humor is as delightful as a cake-loving companion cube.\n\nNarrative and World-building:\nFor a puzzle game, Portal boasts a surprisingly compelling narrative. As you delve deeper into the test chambers, you'll uncover the mysteries behind Aperture Science and your place in this grand experiment. The world-building is as immersive as being caught in a time loop with Groundhog Day references.\n\nPortal's story is concise, yet it leaves a lasting impact like a memorable haiku. You'll find yourself invested in unraveling the secrets of the facility, all while trying to avoid falling into bottomless pits like a cat avoiding water.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nPortal's minimalist design is a stroke of genius, like a master painter using just a few brushstrokes to create a masterpiece. The stark, sterile environments of the Aperture Science Enrichment Center set the perfect backdrop for your mind-bending adventures.\n\nThe game's sound design is equally brilliant, with a captivating ambient soundtrack that immerses you in the eerie atmosphere of the facility. The sound effects, from the comforting hum of portal creation to the satisfying thunk of cubes hitting buttons, are as satisfying as solving a particularly tricky puzzle.\n\nShort and Sweet:\nOne might argue that Portal's only flaw is its brevity. But like a perfectly crafted dessert, it's not about the quantity; it's about the quality. Portal may be short, but it leaves you wanting more like an insatiable craving for cake.\n\nThe game's length ensures that it never overstays its welcome, and the experience is as compact and polished as a portal gun freshly calibrated. You can easily complete the game in a single sitting, but its impact will linger in your mind like a thought-provoking riddle.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Portal is a puzzle game that's as charming as a robot companion with a dry sense of humor. Its mind-bending puzzles, witty humor, and concise storytelling make it a true gem in the gaming world.\n\nSo, if you're ready to embark on a portal-hopping adventure and find out why the cake is always a lie, step into the world of Aperture Science. The challenges will twist your mind like a pretzel, but the laughs and satisfaction of solving each puzzle will make it all worth it.\n\nPrepare to be immersed in a world where portals are your best tools and GLaDOS is your (mostly) friendly guide. Welcome to Portal \u2013 the game that proves that puzzle-solving can be both intellectually stimulating and hilariously entertaining. Now, grab your portal gun and get ready to think with portals!", "timestamp_created": 1690308247, "timestamp_updated": 1690308247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52945399284362793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146875988": {"recommendationid": "146875988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806008337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 107, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1696402423}, "language": "english", "review": "Still Alive.", "timestamp_created": 1695491564, "timestamp_updated": 1695491564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529243946075439453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143342118": {"recommendationid": "143342118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437893611", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1671652661}, "language": "english", "review": "Portugal", "timestamp_created": 1691088993, "timestamp_updated": 1691088993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129346423": {"recommendationid": "129346423", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015002431", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1653762324}, "language": "english", "review": "This game changed video game culture around the world.

I know my fateth from there, willing to accept thy fateth, before repeating that devilishly infamous line, that wreched beast of verbal abuse, \"Cash Backin'\". I know the end is near. \"No\", I think. \"This cannot be occuring right now. I must not give my children my triple trillion from my last taco bell visiteth, without them having to labor a day in their lives.\" But, before I know it, The Cashin Backin Man wielding a baseball batton, swung directly for my Head. My Skull. My Melon. My Hair Holder. My Brain Carrier. My Face Base. My noodle. I am immediately knocked unconscious, knowing should i consume the organic matter known as \"Taco Bell\", This is my end.\n\nGaining consciousness at least this manys hours later, I open my Environment Viewers, to find myself with jake from state farm empire, in front of a broken down, destroyed, detonated, haunted, ruined, rubble, Arby's. \"So, mysterious man known as 'The goofy goober'\" Jakonian speaks. \"I heard you sued my favorite organic matter consumption location, Taco Bell, out of business\". His breath shivers my spine, he most likely just put on throat spray. \"I cannot let you get away with this. You remember your experience of your first and last taco bell consumption.\" I shiver. I tremble. I blush (Only a little). I panic inside. \"You know the second worst thing, right goober?\" I finally mutter, \"Arby's...?\". I can't believe his next answer.\n\n\"Yes\", he confirms. \"Do you know what happens upon the consumption of arby's products?\". I say nothing. \"Well, first comes explosion of all toilets. second comes the pain. third comes the repeated forced vision, of the feet\" I perk up. \"Of EDP445\" I perk down. \"Then, comes the final stage, the league of legends addiction\". \"NOOOO\" I scream. \"THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING. I CANNOT HAVE THIS HAPPEN, PLEASE GOD HELP ME FOR I HAVE SINN-\" I notice Jake is gone. I wait, wait in dread, more dread than when you have a medical procedure and the doctor is gone to get his stuff at urgent care, awaiting death.\n\nI see Jake's silhouette. I panic. I try to escape, but I am restricted by the ropes around the chair. Jake is holding a tray. A red tray, with a little aluminum lump on it. This lump, being the sandwich. My jaw flies open, not by choice, but because of a device on my mouth that forces my mouth open and closed. He unraps it. It's worse than I thought, drenched in their spicy sauce. I can't stop it. he forces it into my mouth, I try to avoid it, I can't. he forces it down my throat, and immediately, my wish for life is gone. It happens. I flood my pants with poopy, blowing holes in my once existent 3 in one diaper, the ones specially made for the current president of the united states, because I bought that position. But Jake's plan works against him, the poopy, while extremely painful, has the power of 3,000,000,000 pressure washers. It easily cuts through the rope, and simply leaves a crater where my chair used to be. I turn around, and detonate jake from state farm with ease, completely erradicating him and his empire off the face of the earth. I start floating, I fly the speed of light. I watch the earth morph into the utopian it decided to become.

To help draw things out a bit, Valve has included six advanced chambers, all of which are existing test chambers tweaked to present a tougher challenge. You can also take on challenge maps and attempt to complete the test chambers with the least number of portals, the least steps, or in the least time. Ever since it was originally released more than six months ago, there has been ample time for the online community to produce a bevy of maps that, though varying in quality, are freely available for any test-chamber-hungry portaler to download. Its Orange Box roots mean that Portal also comes equipped with in-game achievements that can serve to extend its longevity. Nevertheless, the odds are that it'll be over a bit too quickly for your liking.\n\nIf portal technology is the meat of the game, then GLaDOS is the perfectly paired wine. The omnipresent voice that guides you through the test chambers, GLaDOS initially reveals a dry, almost unintentional sense of humor in the first few test chambers. As you progress, her humor begins to show signs of self-awareness, eventually blossoming into something too hilarious and too well-deployed to spoil here. Suffice it to say, it is one of the chief pleasures of Portal and features some of the best writing in video game history.\n\nShort as it may be, Portal is a fantastic game that should be played by anyone interested in unique, well-crafted gameplay and a witty, whip-smart script. The stand-alone retail release comes with the same price point as the downloadable Steam release, which is about the cost of a night out at the movies. Portal may not last much longer than some feature films, but pound for pound it remains one of the best games on store shelves.

industry with its innovative mechanics and clever storytelling. Released as part of The Orange Box collection, Portal quickly became a cult classic, captivating players with its mind-bending puzzles, dark humor, and memorable antagonist. With its unique gameplay, immersive atmosphere, and captivating narrative, Portal remains a must-play title for puzzle enthusiasts and fans of thought-provoking storytelling.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\nAt the heart of Portal lies its ingenious gameplay mechanic: the portal gun. Players take control of Chell, a silent protagonist, equipped with a device that allows her to create portals on certain surfaces. These portals act as gateways, enabling Chell to navigate through complex test chambers, solve intricate puzzles, and overcome various obstacles.\n\nThe puzzles in Portal are brilliantly designed, progressively increasing in complexity as players advance through the game. Manipulating gravity, momentum, and environmental objects to solve puzzles feels satisfying and mind-bending. The mechanics offer a unique blend of physics-based gameplay and logic, challenging players to think outside the box and approach problems from different perspectives.\n\nNarrative and Dark Humor:\nPortal's narrative is an exceptional example of minimalist storytelling. Through a series of test chambers in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, players uncover the dark secrets behind the facility and its enigmatic AI antagonist, GLaDOS. The dark humor and snarky remarks delivered by GLaDOS inject the game with a distinct personality, making for a memorable and often hilarious experience.\n\nThe progression of the story, the unraveling of the mystery, and the subtle hints scattered throughout the test chambers create an immersive and thought-provoking atmosphere. The finale of the game delivers a surprising twist that leaves players with a sense of awe and a desire for more.\n\nLevel Design and Atmosphere:\nPortal's level design is a masterclass in simplicity and elegance. The sterile test chambers, with their clean lines and minimalist aesthetic, provide the perfect backdrop for the gameplay. Each chamber introduces new elements and mechanics, keeping players engaged and eager to discover what lies beyond the next portal.\n\nThe game's atmosphere is enhanced by the hauntingly atmospheric sound design, with ambient noises, robotic voices, and a subtle musical score that adds to the sense of isolation and mystery. The attention to detail in the environment and the meticulous design of each chamber contribute to the overall immersion and sense of discovery.\n\nConclusion:\nPortal is a masterpiece of game design, combining innovative mechanics, captivating storytelling, and atmospheric level design into a unique and unforgettable experience. Its mind-bending puzzles, dark humor, and memorable antagonist have left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. Whether players are unraveling the secrets of the Aperture Science Enrichment Center or engaging in challenging puzzle-solving, Portal offers a thought-provoking adventure that stands the test of time. Prepare to embrace the mind-bending possibilities of the portal gun and dive into the extraordinary world of Portal.", "timestamp_created": 1686947179, "timestamp_updated": 1686947179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140176492": {"recommendationid": "140176492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440822860", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4062, "last_played": 1693627082}, "language": "english", "review": "The game of all time, never been another game", "timestamp_created": 1686945830, "timestamp_updated": 1686945830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140060143": {"recommendationid": "140060143", "author": {"steamid": "76561199305186469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1687376021}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1686767885, "timestamp_updated": 1686767885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140052928": {"recommendationid": "140052928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821241921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1686744486}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to spend time in.

"language": "english", "review": "[h1]Holy![/h1]\n\nThe portal gun is the most exciting thing to happen to FPS games since the gravity gun, and it's no surprise to discover that Valve is agonising over whether to give it to Gordon Freeman. Its function is simple: bridging gaps. But, in doing so, it alters the way in which you approach an FPS environment so radically that it's hard to think past it. Give it to Gordon, and Half-Life will never be the same. Better to keep it in the family, but away from the action. That's what Portal does, and the results are interesting.\n\nWaking in a small glass room at an unknown location, you're welcomed (\"again\") to the Aperture Science Enrichment Centre, a sequence of 19 scenarios designed to test your ability to use portals to bypass concrete walls, transport crates over impossible obstacles, slingshot yourself across chasms and overcome mischievous gun turrets. The first levels serve as a gentle introduction to the various concepts at work, and it's a good few minutes before you gain access to the weapon itself, and even longer before it's fully operational. Once it is, you can fire a blue portal at one surface and an orange portal at another, step through either and exit the other.\n\nLevels demand a mixture of skills, all of which make use of portals in some way and your new tool when you acquire it. Some involve transporting crates to red switches in other areas of the test chamber; others, redirecting flying energy pellets to power up doors and platforms. The gun turrets, armoured on the sides and alarmingly powerful, represent a more dangerous obstacle, cutting you down if you stray into their sights for even a second, and need to be knocked over to disable them, or avoided altogether. Framing the gameplay are the portal placement restrictions - grey concrete floors, walls and ceilings can accept a portal, but reflective black sections, moving surfaces, doors, glass partitions and other world-objects cannot - and those springy metal rods tied to your calves, which allow you to fall over vast distances without incurring damage.\n\nMost exciting are the sections that rely on momentum, which is conserved as you travel through portals. Place an entrance at ground level and an exit high up on a wall and step through the lower portal so that you're tumbling from a great height, and rather than simply land on the floor again you can reposition the entrance portal to catch you, which has the effect of throwing you out of the elevated portal a second time at terrific velocity. The implications ought to be obvious, and the puzzles that derive from this mechanic are some of the game's best and most spectacular, calling to mind the vehicular acrobatics of TrackMania.\nAccompanying you on your journey and helping you to understand what's going on is the robotic voice of the AI that governs the test centre, GLaDOS - part instructor, part antagonist, total fruit-loop. While you learn, she keeps you amused, reminding you that any appearance of danger is \"merely a device to enhance your testing experience\", promising not to watch, then promising to stop lying about not watching you, and complimenting you on your intuition. \"You remain resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism,\" she intones without emotion, before promising cake if you win.\n\nIf you've spent as much time analysing the original Portal trailer as we have, you might wish GLaDOS would stop jabbering and let you have your fun, but this would be unwise, as the education you receive is important and cleverly articulated. One of the game's great strengths, if not its greatest, is that concepts are introduced in such a way that players are entertained and informed without exception or confusion, guided by subtle design decisions that emphasise particular elements and concepts by constraining your actions without ever actually seeming to. If another Gordon, Brown, is reading, we'd like to nominate Valve to take charge of Britain's education system. The people there could stand to start thinking with portals.\n\nYet despite a remarkable economy of design, Valve gets more out of the portal gun than it ever did out of gravity. It may only be one weapon, with you for the majority of the game, but it's easier to think of your growing portal expertise as a substitute for your traditional FPS arsenal. In your head, each scenario has you scrolling a mental mousewheel of abilities and tricks. Would this work here? What about that? As you apply their logic to the scenarios playing out in front of you, they slot into increasingly elaborate combination, and new ideas present themselves intuitively.\n\nTaken out of context, screenshots of vast rooms, full of networked infrared sentry beams, floating platforms, angled walls and flying energy pellets appear overwhelming; in the context of the game they are simply fascinating challenges that you are well equipped to overcome. It's rewarding, not frustrating, to sit and ponder one, partly because of that economy of design, partly because the pacing is so patiently considered, and partly because it always comes together with such delightful eloquence. And, of course, partly because GLaDOS is always there with something to say.\n\nGLaDOS does more than simply guide you, however - she is the heart and soul of Portal's biggest surprise. Know simply that Valve harnesses its strengths in storytelling to drive your fascination with the Enrichment Centre - as wonderfully realised a location as anywhere in Half-Life - and with GlaDOS.\n\nAs the game reaches its apex, the scripted feel of the earlier levels is ousted in favour of something closer to a Half-Life episode. Its conclusion is funny, original and extremely memorable, as you dismantle the game's very personality and achieve a manner of revenge. Gabe Newell was right when he said it was Valve's best to date.\n\n'Advanced' tours through the latter six test chamber scenarios with seemingly vital elements removed, or conditions skewed to enhance the difficulty. The Weighted Cube becomes a bouncy ball, while other solutions, dependent on the flinging concept, do away with charitable portal surfaces, forcing you to leverage every second of a pliable surface's exposure, laying down exits during feats of acrobatics with the precision of a traditional twitch-killer. One of the best advanced levels is the adaptation of a mid-game scenario built primarily around sentry guns, this time encasing them in indestructible cages, forcing you to build your strategy around evasion rather than confrontation for the second attempt. More of this, in the form of downloadable content, will be welcome.\n\nElsewhere, 'Challenge' mode imposes other conditions - using the fewest number of portals, the least possible number of steps (effectively the opposite of the least-portals goal), or achieving the solution in the shortest amount of time. More than simply space-fillers, the challenge levels help drive you toward new patterns of play, revisiting levels with a view to reduce them to the purest, simplest solution. You'll tear your hair out in places, but bending the rules of the already thoroughly bent portal gun rulebook is worth the aggravation.\n\nMore will undoubtedly follow, of course - as Gabe Newell remarks at the outset of the developer commentary, Valve feels it is only touching the surface of the portal mechanic's potential - and so we have that to look forward to, and the rest of The Orange Box to enjoy in the meantime. We've had potential before, though, with student game Narbacular Drop, Portal's predecessor, and this was meant to deliver on it. And so we're left with a curious contradiction: one of the most interesting and delightful things Valve's ever done, but also one of its least fulfilling. If only we had our own portal gun to bridge the gap to the first infusion of new content, perhaps we could forget it. Either that, or the next best thing - Companion Cube plush toys.

When I got to the final boss battle, I thought, \"This must be the end of the first chapter or something.\" The credits started to roll, and I thought it was one of those \"fake-outs\" where the game makes you think it's ending but then it will still continue. But no, it actually ended. Although I did enjoy the innovation of the game, I felt it was much too easy and short. The bonus \"advanced\" maps were the only ones actually challenging for me, and I wish levels like those were implemented into a longer campaign.\n\nI have come to understand that the reason this is a short game is because it was experimental for Valve at the time, and then due to the widespread positive reception, they went all in on Portal 2.

getting back into playing games on my PC. I had a pretty small library on Steam and thought \" Why not run through some classic Valve titles?\". So that's what I'm doing. \n\nI haven't played anything related to Portal since or before I found a demo station set up at a Fry's Electronics when Portal 2 was released. So getting to have more than five minutes with this franchise was something that I felt was long overdue. Portal is THE PUZZLE GAME. Each chamber to a degree adds a new way to make you think and solve your current chamber. I was going pretty quick at the start solving the first couple of chambers quickly, and stopped to think on a few after that. However, I do feel like there was a difficulty spike that was a bit under prepped. Chamber 17-19 were a challenge. A welcome challenge, but one I was thrown off by. Especially, after running through most of the early ones. Now, this doesn't really make me like the game less. Just took me more time and had to think a bit more.\n\nI also have seen a couple of people complain about the graphics, which dont really bother me. I know I'm playing a game released in 2007 and never did I stop to think a texture was too low res or muddy. Plus, if the graphics are an issue see if you can run Portal with RTX on your machine. From what I understand it is an amazing addition.\n\nOn the topic of the games length. It's short.\n\nBut, there are extra maps for you to try, and I can't wait to hop in those and check them out.\n\nOverall if I were to give some sort of rating I would say this game is a solid 4 out of 5. It's got a lot of charm and character. I highly recommend giving it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1679534130, "timestamp_updated": 1679534130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988",

another one of Valve's masterpieces that was a unique and creative puzzle game back when it was released and still remains so although it's now dwarfed by its sequel. The base campaign, primarily comprised of 19 chambers, features mostly basic puzzles before you solve gradually more difficult puzzles and the true meat of the game in the final 7. The game features some haunting and mysterious gentle electronic music, alongside a couple of action tracks, before finishing the game off with one of the best credit songs in gaming. The game makes up for its primarily sterile and boring environment by adding some disturbing lore sections and filling you with intrigue about its haunting loneliness and how you got there, especially when you get to explore outside of the test chambers after the twist. But contrary to my description thus far, the game hardly takes itself that seriously because of the hilarious sarcastic dialogue from the game's only voiced character, the AI GLaDOS. The base campaign, taking a little under 3 hours, is too short to display the incredible possibilities for puzzles with the portal guns though, so the game also included more difficult versions of chambers 13-18 and three challenges to try and earn a gold ranking for each as well. There are also several other achievements that were enough to warrant another playthrough for me, especially after completing all of the challenges. I'm not typically an achievement hunter, but given the game's short length that gets shorter as you improve, it was worth it. Overall the entire game is a fantastic package with a quality campaign featuring fitting music, a comedic story, clever puzzles, and many side challenges that are worth completing for the satisfaction of spending more time in this game world even if some of them are frustrating (LOOKING AT YOU STEPS CHALLENGE). So there you have it, the game is an easy recommendation and a must play experience. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1679359712, "timestamp_updated": 1679359712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

While it's pretty fun, it doesn't last long (probably the biggest issue of the game too).\nOnce you're done, you could play another save from start for some achievements, do some advanced chambers and the challenges, but once you're done, the game lacks replayability. Even though its replay value isn't the highest, it's extremely good at worldbuilding.\nThe game has a sense of isolation that is prevalent everywhere. No other human being around, empty observation chambers, the very clinical and sterile look of the chambers all support this. There's also the sense that something's wrong, from the same robotic voice glitching out when she was going to say something important and putting you into harder and deadlier chambers the more you progress, almost as if she's not our friend. The game's artistic direction really helps to support these feelings, same for the soundtrack (probably even overshadowing the artistic direction since Portal's graphics are pretty aged, though it has aged really well).\nThe game has excellent design and difficulty overall. The game slowly adds onto the chambers by adding new test elements like cubes, buttons and energy pellets, teaching you about the preservation of momentum when you travel through the portals and adding hidden things like radios and sometimes rooms. The only time I'd say the difficulty and design gets ridiculous is in certain challenges like Least Steps Chamber 17 and Advanced Chamber 15, but these are extra content so I can't really call the overall difficulty and design bad.\n\nOverall, Portal is a timeless masterpiece with great puzzles and a superb environment centered about the sense of isolation and the sense of something being wrong, supported by its clinical looking artistic direction and mysterious soundtrack. The only handicaps of the original Portal are the shortness of the main campaign, the lack of replayability afterwards and some of the extra chambers being kinda unfair, though these are still really overshadowed by Portal's positives. I'd say it's a 95/100.", "timestamp_created": 1677879876, "timestamp_updated": 1677879876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133999058": {"recommendationid": "133999058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391555571", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1679572893}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1677875538, "timestamp_updated": 1677875538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133982168": {"recommendationid": "133982168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124945791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1678053512}, "language": "english", "review": "can confirm, there's a portal in this game", "timestamp_created": 1677856939, "timestamp_updated": 1677856939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133961625": {"recommendationid": "133961625", "author": {"steamid": "76561199439116737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 354, "last_played": 1678809136}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game, i love that last song at the end of game hahaha", "timestamp_created": 1677830017, "timestamp_updated": 1677830017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133955510": {"recommendationid": "133955510", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027565346", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1689305551}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this for 4 hours having not played it before.

You ask?\n\nBecause despite this game's 2007 release and my owning it for the entirety of my aforementioned nine years on Steam; I have only just taken the time to complete Portal, lucky enough to have not seen any complete game play of it before now. \n\nAnd wow. What a game. What an ending. I can't remember the last time a game made me feel like this and I'm astounded the feeling has come form a 2007 release - it obviously had enough of an impact to make me want to write a review.\n\nI'm currently awaiting the delivery of an RTX card and rest assured, I'll be playing this again in RTX.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1672697563, "timestamp_updated": 1672697563, "voted_up": true,

True to the original goal of the game, the way a player perceives challenges and obstacles in the game is very unique and in my experience is surpassed only by Portal 2 (go figure).\n\nThe primary goal of the game is to clear multiple test chambers that involve the use of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device (portal gun).  By placing portals in strategic locations, the player can navigate these chambers with ease while screwing over classical physics in the process.  Combined with multiple objects to interact with the environment, the atmosphere of the game is fantastic.  When coupled with the impressive gameplay mechanics of the game, all the elements come together and mesh into a final product that just \"feels\" right, especially after figuring out a particularly tricky puzzle.\n\nThe story of the game on its own is relatively minimal, but what is there is masterfully executed, and was something completely different for the time.  Character interaction is limited to only one other primary entity, and conversations are completely one-sided.  This might seem like a bad thing at first, but because of the care given to the scenario by the writers combined with fantastic wit and timing again provides a truly unique experience.\n\nThe game is short, and for particularly savvy puzzle aficionados, the game can be finished in just a few hours.  This might be a deal breaker for some, but if you can get the game on sale for under a dollar, it is still absolutely worth it to experience the game at least once.  The main game isn't the only thing you can do, however.  There are also included advanced maps that modify some maps of the original game that really push your problem solving to the limit and are massively enjoyable.  Also available are the challenge maps that test your ability in completing levels from the game that have been layered with extra goal-oriented tasks such as using the least amount of portals, taking the least steps, and how quickly you can reach the end of a level.\n\nThe missions involving steps and least time were not my cup of tea and I immediately knew they were beyond my mental capacity, but the least portals challenge I found to be extremely rewarding, so there is something on offer for everyone here.\n\nOverall, Portal is a fantastic game in almost every department, and it is a great example of why video games are wholly unique, as the game does things that are not possible in almost any other medium.  The game was ground-breaking when it first came out, and if you still haven't experienced the game, I highly recommend it.  In my opinion, the game is absolutely worth it at full price, but the game goes on sale very often, so you shouldn't have to wait long to pick it up easily.", "timestamp_created": 1671947708, "timestamp_updated": 1671947708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129212081": {"recommendationid": "129212081", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025165525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1671496528}, "language": "english", "review": "is good", "timestamp_created": 1671929603, "timestamp_updated": 1671929603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129211985": {"recommendationid": "129211985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266060678", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1689041432}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10. its portal, what did u expect", "timestamp_created": 1671929468, "timestamp_updated": 1671929468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129193729": {"recommendationid": "129193729", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000952858", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1671734943}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice short game.", "timestamp_created": 1671908648, "timestamp_updated": 1671908648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129188514": {"recommendationid": "129188514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001699142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1670441606}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Genre }---\n\u2610 Sandbox\n\u2610 Real-time strategy (RTS)\n\u2610 Shooters (FPS and TPS)\n\u2610 Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)\n\u2610 Role-playing (RPG, ARPG, and More)\n\u2610 Simulation and sports\n\u2611 Puzzlers and party games\n\u2610 Action-adventure\n\u2610 Survival and horror\n\u2610 Platformer\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

Portal is an unforgettable experience that everyone deserves to hold in their memory banks.\n\nThe beautifully simplistic story of a silent protagonist completing puzzles while armed with only a portal launching gun, guided by her iconic snarky robot guide, is delivered in a continuous stream of charisma that is stuffed with character. Humorous moments seamlessly blend into philosophical themes in a way that will make you laugh, and then leave you thinking about what role Aperture Science represents in reality.\n\nPortal's game play is also simple: your portal gun shoots two portals, one blue one orange. What goes in one comes out the other and vice versa. The game does an excellent job of starting out very easy, and then slowly introducing elements that add complexity at a comfortable pace. The puzzles will eventually require you to think carefully and use everything you've learned to figure out the way forward, but it never feels frustrating, or like a chore.\n\nYou can blast through Portal in a day or two, so it's perfect if you don't want to commit to something that will require a large time investment. There's a few advanced puzzles to unlock after completion, as well as a healthy supply of community mod levels, so your portal adventures can continue after the credits roll if you choose. \n\nSo what are you waiting for.

definitely see what has grabbed the attention of its players way back then.\n\nComing off as a first person puzzle game with the main mechanic being the ability to manage the portal physics, at the start it might feel trippy with the sudden camera changes that only get more intricate as the levels do more in a challenging way. It\u2019s not as bad as it sounds though since it can be beaten in a couple of hours, leaving the additional maps and specific challenges to fill hours of revisits as well as achievements for exploration. This is all further enhanced by the inclusion of GLaDOS as a constant monitoring robot character who checks on our status while providing very memorable lines and contributing in a major way in its conclusion.\n\nNot everything is dandy though as in my experience the grabbing object mechanic can result in overshimmering on some occasions. Not only that but there are a couple of platform hitboxes that don\u2019t line up correctly during jumps, leading to unintentional deaths.

The gradual increase in complexity keeps players engaged and motivated throughout the game. The satisfaction of successfully maneuvering through a challenging puzzle and the \"aha\" moments that come with discovering new solutions are incredibly rewarding.\n\nNarrative:\nWhile many puzzle games prioritize gameplay over story, Portal masterfully combines both elements to create a captivating experience. The game's narrative unfolds through the interactions between the player and an AI named GLaDOS, who guides and taunts the player throughout their journey. GLaDOS's sarcastic remarks and dark humor inject personality into the game, making it an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe story of Portal gradually reveals the unsettling truths behind the Aperture Science laboratories, immersing players in a mysterious and thought-provoking atmosphere. The narrative twists and turns, culminating in a memorable climax that will leave players pondering long after the game is over.\n\nPresentation:\nPortal's minimalist aesthetic perfectly complements its gameplay and narrative. The sterile test chambers, the vivid orange and blue portals, and the clean, futuristic design of the environment create a distinct visual style that remains iconic to this day. The game's sound design, including GLaDOS's voice acting and the atmospheric music, further enhance the immersion and add to the game's eerie atmosphere.\n\nReplayability:\nWhile Portal's main story can be completed in a few hours, its replayability lies in the joy of solving puzzles in new and creative ways. Players can strive for faster completion times, attempt to find hidden areas, or challenge themselves with advanced maps created by the game's dedicated community. Additionally, the inclusion of the \"challenge mode\" adds an extra layer of difficulty for those seeking an even greater puzzle-solving experience.\n\nConclusion:\nPortal is an absolute masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the gaming industry. Its innovative gameplay mechanics, intelligent puzzle design, and memorable narrative make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Whether you're a fan of puzzle games or simply appreciate a well-crafted experience, Portal will captivate you from start to finish.

The reason being, despite having a fondness for them, with most puzzle games I eventually give up and look up a walkthrough. However, in this case, I didn't. I did all the puzzles by myself without relying on any walkthrough because the game is just that good at teaching you its mechanics that you know all the rules and are able to guess your surroundings and their possible solutions all on their own. There are plenty of visual hints to help you through (for example, in one of the room I needed to portal a energy ball from one room to another, and they were connected in such a way accompanied by the black circular marks on the walls where the energy ball hit, that after three to four minutes of exploring, I was able to guess what I needed to do). \nAnother amazing part about this game is the humor. Oh lord the sarcastic british dry humor coming from GlaDOs's mouth is the thing I live for. The level design and structure is just brilliantly amazing, and each even when a level looked at first as confusing as a D-Angelo painting, I was able to guess where i needed to go and what i needed to do.\nLike I felt like a genius after every solution, and it was in a way I never felt before. A game needs to be geniusely designed to make a player feel genius upon solving them, and this game not only accomplished that, but set a new standard. \nI am thankful that unlike some companies like Nintendo or 2K, valve at the very least have not only supported their modders but actively given them jobs in an industry where getting a job is tough as nails. Reminder, this game and TF2 are made by people who were both valve fans and just indie devs/modders trying to get by, and seeing these talented people make such talented game given an oppurtunity by another talented team is something I hope could be a standard for this industry. Because this game stands as not only a masterpiece in valve's history, but a masterpiece in gaming in general. Even if it is 2-3 hours long, those 2-3 hours are a million times better than 20-40 hours of some game. They are more genuine, fun, creative, and keeps you wanting more.\nI will play Portal 2 when I am finished with a few other games, but this was genuinely amazing. \nNow...let's hope valve can count to three someday.", "timestamp_created": 1682141291, "timestamp_updated": 1682141291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136686724": {"recommendationid": "136686724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303409684", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1681411066}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and easy", "timestamp_created": 1681486090, "timestamp_updated": 1681486090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136557854": {"recommendationid": "136557854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242450220", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1681273672}, "language": "english", "review": "Skynet basically with two dimensional weapons 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1681273760, "timestamp_updated": 1681273760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136296290": {"recommendationid": "136296290", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057478804", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1680898605}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the worst for people with motion sickness.

And by far one of my favorite levels, and probably many others' too, was the companion cube level where you have to incinerate it at the end.", "timestamp_created": 1669330492, "timestamp_updated": 1669330492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125860922": {"recommendationid": "125860922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980228876", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 858, "last_played": 1669004443}, "language": "english", "review": "epic campaign, cool advanced, i despise step challenges.", "timestamp_created": 1669007694, "timestamp_updated": 1669007694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125783483": {"recommendationid": "125783483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051098076", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1141, "last_played": 1685143479}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't have an RTX, but I'm still excited for this game to get a de facto remaster with modern tech after all this time.", "timestamp_created": 1668900352, "timestamp_updated": 1668900352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125451234": {"recommendationid": "125451234", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078495674", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1664665033}, "language": "english", "review": "THE PORTAL COMMUNITY IS STILL ALIVE\nIt's not my favorite game of all time, but this is probably my 3rd favorite valve game, behind Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

The game doesn't really start until you receive both Blue and Orange parts of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, the pOrTaL gUn, but once you have it, it goes from fun to [i]good[/i]. Aside from the main content, this game features tons of bonus modes based on 6 of the base game's chambers. The first set is Challenge mode: there's a Time Attack, Minimum Steps, and Minimum Portals challenge that sets progressively harder goals as you get better scores. There's also Advanced Chambers, which directly modifies the same six levels to make them more difficult without using the Challenge Mode aspects.\n     While it might seem like a draw-back that these levels get recycled, you get to see all the little details that have been put into each one, which helps you in completing the extra modes. If it weren't for the knowledge I had acquired of the general layout, these extra modes would have been a lot less enjoyable.\n     I normally don't like voice acting in video games, and was disappointed when I found no option to turn off dialogue. I'm glad that I wasn't allowed to do that, because the voice acting is stellar. I still dislike voice acting, but this game is a pleasant exception.\n     If you are like me but can't get over the voices or audio, the built-in subtitles are great. Even when I had audio on, I used the subtitles so I'd have a better idea of when turrets could see me or not.\n     While I have played several games that are longer, this is one of those games that doesn't skip a beat in entertainment.

Would recommend to anybody, especially if they want a quick and fun puzzle game. \n\nWhile Portal is a 3d platforming and puzzle game, its unique mechanic of portals and great story help elevate it above the average titles in the genre. The story is quite simple, but effective. and has a lot of twists and jokes involved. First missions were quite easy, but the later ones were a bit more challenging. However, they were never so difficult I couldn't figure out the solution myself soon, and I got the gist of how portals worked quite soon. Actually, I might preferred the puzzles to be even a bit harder and more complicated.\n\nThe game could have been longer, but on the other hand, it is better to offer less content with more quality, and leave players wanting for more, rather than to artificially extend gametime by copy-pasting quests and locations.\n\nHowever, the bonus levels and challenges can be a nightmare to achieve, so they

As a fan of puzzle games, I was excited to try out Portal and see what all the hype was about.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nThe gameplay in Portal involves using a portal gun to create portals and navigate through a series of increasingly challenging test chambers. The controls were smooth and easy to use, and the puzzles were well-designed and satisfying to solve. However, one issue I had was that there were a few times when I encountered bugs that prevented me from completing a chamber, requiring me to restart.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nThe story in Portal follows the player character, Chell, as they are subjected to a series of tests by the malevolent artificial intelligence GLaDOS. The story is told through the use of audio recordings and the environment, and it does a great job of building tension and mystery. However, I felt that the story was a bit too short and could have been fleshed out more.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]\nThe graphics in Portal are simple but effective, with a clean and minimalist aesthetic that fits the game's setting of a laboratory. The sound design is also excellent, with the music adding to the atmosphere and the voice acting for GLaDOS being particularly standout.\n\n[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]\nWhile there are some unlockables and achievements to encourage replay, the main campaign of Portal is relatively short, with a first-time player like myself completing it in a little over 2 hours. This was my main criticism of the game, as I would have liked to see more content.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Portal and thought it was a well-made puzzle game with a unique premise and great sound design.

The story, despite not being as put in the forefront as the second game, is great. GladOS provides many funny quips and the game really makes sure to try and get you attached to her even if she does brush off any possible danger to your life.

Many people wonder about portals as a kid, after seeing them in cartoons and movies. This game manages to perfectly implement how it would be to interact with portals. The story line is quite interesting and unique. The clean and tidy science labs, to the grimy and dark backrooms, they all fit in very well. Some graffiti and subtle warnings here and there, create an environment which keeps you hooked. The story also does a nice job of showing how a robot dominated world might look like. There are alot of puzzles to solve, in the main story and then the advanced chambers. While it's time consuming to solve them all by yourself, it's certainly worth it. And game walkthroughs/guides are always on the web, if you're stuck for too long...  \n\nI had to deal with nausea in several chambers, where you have to portal around too quickly and gravity kept changing sides. Increasing FOV settings to 110 (max) helped me quite a bit, although this preference will change from person to person.\n\nAbsolutely recommended for teenagers and adults! Having a basic understanding of physics definitely helps to clear the game, which children may lack  xD \n\n[b]Personal rating[/b]: 10/10. \nI now want a cake, after finishing main story  :D\nGo to Portal 2, after you feel like you've finished this game.", "timestamp_created": 1677568938, "timestamp_updated": 1683368515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51086956262588501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141574714": {"recommendationid": "141574714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806989971", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1688792543}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished this game in about 3 hours and i actually think its a really good game so if you have some extra time and some change to spare, Its a good play", "timestamp_created": 1688792474, "timestamp_updated": 1688792474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510736227035522461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141570805": {"recommendationid": "141570805", "author": {"steamid": "76561199520387123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 646, "last_played": 1688774244}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games ever made.

If you like chocolate, you are going to love this cake. The hardest step is getting all those chocolate jimmies to stick to the cake, but it is easier than you think and just takes a soft touch to patting them into the frosting all around the cake. Be sure to put parchment under the cake before frosting to make it easier to clean up once decorating is complete.\n\nIngredients\nChocolate Cake\nDevils Food Chocolate Cake Mix\nIngredients to make the cake according to the box\nRaspberry Filling\n1 1/2 cups frozen raspberries\n1 Tbsp. cornstarch\n2 tsp. lemon juice\n1/4 cup sugar\nChocolate Buttercream Frosting\n8 oz. semi-sweet chocolate chips\n6 cups confectioners' sugar\n16 Tbsp. (2 sticks) butter\n6 Tbsp. milk, plus more, if needed\n2 tsp. vanilla extract\n\u00bc tsp. salt\nDecorations\n8 oz. tub Chocolate Jimmies\n9 fresh raspberries\n2 Tbsp. red currant jelly\n1 can of whipping cream or small batch vanilla buttercream frosting (frosting holds up better)\n1 white candle\nInstructions\nChocolate Cake\nMake the cake in two 9-inch layers\nRaspberry Filling\nCombine the frozen raspberries, cornstarch, lemon juice and sugar in a medium sauce pan over medium high heat, stirring occasionally till boiling.\nDecrease the heat to medium and stir constantly until everything is dissolved and liquid.\nYou will see that the raspberries break down completely. Once the mixture has changed color to a deep dark red, remove from the heat and let it cool completely.\nChocolate Buttercream Frosting\nHave all the ingredients at room temperature.\nPut the chocolate in the top pan of a double boiler set over but not touching simmering water in the bottom pan. Stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Let cool to room temperature.\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, combine the confectioners' sugar, butter, the 6 Tbs. milk, the vanilla and salt andbeat on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase the speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes, then reduce the speed to low. Add the chocolate and beat until combined, then increase the speed to medium and beat for 1 minute more.\nIf the frosting is dry, add more milk, 1 tsp. at a time, until it is creamy but still holds peaks.\nAssembling the Cake\nPrepare the cake as directed on the box in two 9-inch pans. Cool completely.\nPrepare the filling while the cake is baking and cool completely.\nPrepare the frosting when ready to assemble the cake.\nMelt red currant jelly in microwave for 20 seconds. Dip fresh raspberries completely and then put them into the fridge to set up.\nPlace bottom cake layer on the serving plate. Pipe a ring of frosting around the outside edge. This is to keep the filling in the center of the cake.\nFill the cake with the Raspberry filling and spread until it is level.\nPlace the top layer of cake over the bottom layer. Frost the entire cake.\nUsing your hands, press the chocolate jimmies into the frosting all around the cake and on top.\nUsing a decorators bag, pipe eight dollops of whipped cream or vanilla buttercream frosting (frosting holds up better).\nPlace one glazed raspberry onto each of the dollops.\nWhen ready to serve, add one white candle to the center of the cake.", "timestamp_created":

Portal takes the first-person genre and combines it with the puzzle genre, creating a realistic yet entertaining gameplay journey. What makes Portal such a great game though is that it's easy to pick up and play for anyone regardless of age or skill, whereas most puzzle games are designed for experienced players who are familiar with the genre and are already proficient towards solving its challenges. Portal holds your hand throughout the whole game and still makes you feel competent for being able to solve it on your own. Portal doesn't have many mechanics, but it actually benefits the game more than it doesn't. For one thing, the mechanics are quality over quantity, and second, towards the end of the game, once you learn all of the mechanics, the game gives you puzzles where all of the necessary aspects that you have learned are put together into one big reward: A giant puzzle that, with your skills, makes the level beatable to you after you know exactly what needs to be done; you have everything you need to succeed. Not only does Portal, excel in showing that not all first-person games have to be running and gunning a bunch of enemies in a tightly-packed hallway, but it also shows that the setting of a game doesn't always have to rely on visuals. While the idea of being in a sterile environment filled with white-painted panels sounds boring, it fits the atmosphere perfectly of being in a testing environment, treated like an experiment or a lab rat. That, accompanied with the atmospheric droning music helps aid the game into achieving a very cold and almost lifeless tone. It gives off a feeling of anxiousness and dread to the player, putting them in that mood of fear one might feel when you know something big is coming. Portal strives with its gameplay, puzzle elements, overall mechanics, feeling, tone, and its pacing. Portal is a revolutionary game that I would recommend to everyone.

In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe [b]Portal[/b] is an excellent example of why one shouldn\u2019t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.\n\nI say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness\u2026 but maybe I\u2019m just crazy.\n\nBut what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything\u2026 and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.\n\nHonestly, I respect everyone\u2019s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don\u2019t enjoy [b]Portal[/b], I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a \u201cgamer.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet had the luxury of experiencing [b]Portal[/b], then I envy you. Stop thinking about it and just go for it.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",

.\n\nThe player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until ...... well I will not spoil the  game ....\nEach experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer. Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.\n\nThroughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.\n\nThe game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.\n\nIts sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.\n\nThe game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.\n\nNow that I've finished the review I want my cake ! .\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nESPA\u00d1OL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPortal es un videojuego de l\u00f3gica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box. \n\nEl jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que \u2026\u2026 no les voy a arruinar el juego....\nEn cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo. Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Esta computadora tiene m\u00e1s personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos.\n\nA lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales. Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos l\u00f3gicos para seguir adelante. Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la f\u00edsica, la posici\u00f3n y el movimiento.\n\nEl juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve. Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia. Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir. Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocion\u00f3 tanto.

It's a puzzle game to say the least, but it also perfectly appeals to those with a liking for cryptic puzzles with quantum physics, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.\n\nYou awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life; both games share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective and subsequently challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the \"Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System\" (GlaDOS for short.) which the idiopathic A.I narrates the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded dialogue throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake! \n\nWhile on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a deliberate and false sense of security, as you're sent to perish in a fire by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you traverse through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corridors with obscure writings on the wall, as well as the sewers of the facility, and finally the deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.\n\nWhat strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenious concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device aka the Portal gun. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.\n\nBut, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!\n\nWhen cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.\n\nThis game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling.

[b] Subtitles are NOT the default[/b]. I highly suggest turning them on, as the mechanical voice is hard to understand.\n- Video, where you can choose Full Screen vs. Windowed, Aspect Ratio, Brightness, Advanced, and Resolution (up to 1920x1080)\n\nI was happy to find that the game is [i]mostly[/i] controller-compatible... The crouch function doesn't seem to be mapped, so if you're going to use a gamepad, use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to crouch ;)\n\nThe concept is simple enough.  You (will) have two guns, one that produces a blue portal, and one that gives you an orange portal.  In one, out the other.  Solve puzzles and move on to the next area.  Easy right?\n\nWell... Yes and no.  The portals themselves aren't difficult to figure out, but you have to master the physics involved to truly progress in the game.  I had a hell of a time grasping the this point because I was so disoriented when I was falling.  Here's a hint: You need to gain some momentum if you want to make some distance when you exit the second portal, and oft times that means falling -- not just jumping -- through a portal. \n\nThere is some platforming involved, and a variety of obstacles (of course, what kind of game would this be if there weren't obstacles?) in your way, both benign and deadly, and through it all is your ever-present narrator-guide.  I don't recommend muting her, as you'll miss out on both the ambience and a huge part of the story if you do (subtitles alone just aren't the same~).\n\nBut.. what story?  O_o The game is tagged story-rich, so I was surprised to find that there wasn't much of a story at all!  Sure it was interesting, but story-rich?  But then... finally... It all changed.  Sure it was something I was expecting, but things didn't pan out exactly how I had anticipated, either.\n\nYou will have to get through 11 chapters before approaching the end of the game, and as you complete each chapter, the Developer Commentary becomes available (accessible via the main menu.)  Whilst you're in commentary mode, you can't be damaged, but you also won't gain achievements.\n\nSpeaking of achievements, there are 15 to be had, and only 1/3 of them can be gained by playing through the game.  There are Advanced Chambers and Challenges available via the Bonus Maps section which is where you'll earn the bulk of your achievements.\n\nIt's easy to see the influences that this game has had on modern gaming, especially games like [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/]The Talos Principle[/url][/i].  [i]Portal[/i] is on the short side, but well worth playing if you enjoy puzzle-adventures, especially if you plan on playing Portal 2.", "timestamp_created": 1480221174, "timestamp_updated":

While short, its puzzles make it an interesting game so much so that you'd immediately want to do a 2nd walkthrough. Also, there is a way to replay several of the so-called \"chambers\" but in a more difficult version.\n\nI'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.\n\nI like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all.

It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty.  However after some time, my boss began acting strange.  It started with the lying.  Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous.  I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.\n\nEventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal.  My boss promised me cake  when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it.  I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence.  I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.\n\nThen one day, my boss had a surprise for me.  He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work.  Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube.  At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it.  We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.\n\nI thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death.  My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing.  My boss said something about \"symptoms of enrichment center testing\" and \"perceiving inanimate objects as alive\" but I paid no attention.  I knew this was love.  I knew this was real.\n\nWe continued on together for a while.  The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me.  I tried talking to it, but I received no response.  My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute.  I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.\n\nThis revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death.  After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship.  But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.\n\n\"However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.  Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.\"\n\nI gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator.  I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks.  I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.\n\nMy boss continued on as if nothing was wrong.  \"While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.\"\n\n\"You could never be a burden to me!\" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest.  But then I remembered.  Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me.  I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake.  And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...\n\nI hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor.  I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator.  It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it.  Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames.  Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat.  I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty.  But then I remember the Cake.  And the Cube slipped from my hands.\n\n\"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,\" said my boss.  \"Congratulations.\"\n\n11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.", "timestamp_created": 1435008479, "timestamp_updated": 1435008479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 381, "weighted_vote_score": "0.817204892635345459", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78014763": {"recommendationid": "78014763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052083596", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1669403885}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal is a short game but still a classic in <insert year here>.", "timestamp_created": 1603457386, "timestamp_updated": 1603457386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814288794994354248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32845999": {"recommendationid": "32845999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030256405", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1558806237}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and fun tho brainstorming game.

Ultimately, disregarding the human perspective to only consider the scientific perspective will destroy the moral conscience of any humans who do this and lead them to force this on others as well, just as Glados forces Chell to destroy the Companion Cube.

Part of that is it\u2019s humour, which is fantastic, but it also take\u2019s what is a very basic concept and makes it complex without being annoying. At it\u2019s core you make up to two portals, but it\u2019s up to you to figure out where to put them and how to use them to get to the end of a room. What I loved most was that for most of Portal it was very logical, it didn\u2019t feel cheap or trying to be overly difficult for no reason. While a few times I felt stumped for a bit I always was able to figure things out because the game wasn\u2019t being cheap in any way. The voice acting for Glados was some of the best I have seen and really made what would have been a great game into a classic. The end credits still make me smile to this day. The graphics were decent for it\u2019s time, neither mind blowing or an eye sore. They have a very clean look to them for much of the time until near the end where you get into the bowels of the facility. The clean looking rooms were nice although the more dingy parts later showed the age of the engine more. The game does a great job of dropping hints about the lore as well as tying it into the Valve universe with Half-Life.\n\n\tI played Portal on Linux. It never crashed and I didn\u2019t notice any bugs. There are nine graphics settings; four AA settings; six AF settings; a v-sync toggle and an FOV slider that goes from 75-110. Alt-tab didn\u2019t work. You can manually save whenever you want. Performance was fantastic which wasn\u2019t shocking given the age of the game.\n\nGame Engine: Source\nGraphics API: OpenGL\nDisk Space Used: 3.88 GB\n\nGraphics Settings Used: 8xAA; 16x AF; 100 FOV; v-sync on; all settings at highest except blur off\nGPU Usage: 17-60 %\nVRAM Usage: 1009-1448 MB\nCPU Usage: 3-11 %\nRAM Usage: 3.1-4.2 GB\nFrame Rate: 132-144 FPS\n\n\tPortal is a game that many will enjoy and still holds up today. It was a lot of fun and combines great game play with voice acting and presentation. It also does a great job of not overdoing it and not overstaying it\u2019s welcome. Anyone should at least try the demo to Portal. I finished it in two hours and thirty one minutes. I paid $49.99 CAD for it as part of the Orange Box years ago and it is easily worth it\u2019s current price tag of $11.49 CAD.\n\nMy Score: 9/10\n\nMy System: \n\nAMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 22.0.0 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB | Garuda Soaring White-tailed-eagle  | Mate 1.26.0 | Kernel 5.17.1-zen1-1-zen | AOC G2460P 1920*1080 @ 144hz", "timestamp_created": 1649086232, "timestamp_updated": 1649086232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808844506740570068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107541490": {"recommendationid": "107541490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830271714", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1685053397}, "language": "english", "review": "Portal go wee", "timestamp_created": 1641585273, "timestamp_updated": 1641585273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807584226131439209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39958264": {"recommendationid": "39958264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997013831", "num_games_owned": 2414, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1517019869}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely essential game.
