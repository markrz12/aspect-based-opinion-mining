Baba is You is the latest gift from the Finnish game development Gods housed in the frame of one man: Arvi Teikari. Just like previous eccentric auteurs before him - Lucas Pope and Victor Frankenstein, Teikari\u2019s vision is uncompromising, innovative and brutal. Brutal not in the sense of a monster you\u2019ve created murdering your fianc\u00e9 but that the obstacles in the game and their levels of abstraction are tough. It goes without saying that despite Baba is You\u2019s cute aesthetics, the puzzles become immensely complex as you progress. \n\nIn order to lessen the mental burden upon the player, so one can avoid the fatal conclusion of \u201cI ain\u2019t playing that\u201d, Teikari designed the entire game around working backwards from the solution. This easier-said-than-done concept is the the game itself, from the numerous ways one can tackle the very first puzzle to the meta-insanity of the final worlds. Perhaps the game should have been titled \"Baba is Creative\", though that does not pique interest nor is it fun to say out loud, but it is the principal theme of the game: there's as much freedom as one would expect from immersive sims. I could go on and on about how the design should be the poster child of the overused term \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d, but that\u2019s not what matters. What matters is Baba is You is a unique experience unlike anything else in gaming, and it\u2019s a great one at that.", "timestamp_created": 1681764025, "timestamp_updated": 1687641062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792103409767150879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136117902": {"recommendationid": "136117902", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231800346", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1679859079}, "language": "english", "review": "I am too stupid for this but its fun", "timestamp_created": 1680649511, "timestamp_updated": 1680649511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78750920295715332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136927264": {"recommendationid": "136927264", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168279227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 113, "last_played": 1682065162}, "language": "english", "review": "baba is definitely aint me", "timestamp_created": 1681853380, "timestamp_updated": 1681853380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78616631031036377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131061927": {"recommendationid": "131061927", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060689204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1694835713}, "language": "english", "review": "rose is red\nviolet is blue\ngame is hard\nbaba is you", "timestamp_created": 1674006353, "timestamp_updated": 1674006353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784844815731048584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131932340": {"recommendationid": "131932340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212611057", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3112, "last_played": 1675153965}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a good time while going for 100% completion. \n\nSome of the puzzles left me really stumped, and I would shamefully look up the level solution, only to berate myself for how close I was.

It is a very hard game, but it still has a pretty good learning curve as there are easier levels spread throughout to teach you how certain blocks work, and then further levels to get you to question that. Many advanced levels build on things you did to solve previous levels, so if you're ever stuck (and you will be), there are always plenty of other levels to play around with and think about.\n\nI don't recommend using a solution guide for any puzzle game, but for Baba Is You, I REALLY don't recommend it. My mind was blown so many times while playing through and it is an incredibly satisfying experience. Just when you think you've seen it all, the game gets even deeper. For the best experience, do as much as you can without any outside help. I had to come back months later to recharge my brain and then when I started to make a certain amount of progress, I couldn't stop playing. In fact, I skipped dozens of levels and had to go back to them later because I just kept getting pulled further and further in a different direction :) If you're really stuck on a specific puzzle for hours and hours, there's a very helpful no-spoiler hint site that I recommend, but I only recommend it for specific puzzles that you're currently accessing. It orders the hints in terms of helpfulness too, so it helps to confirm if you're thinking about the level in a good way. Try to avoid hints on where to go next though, as doing so may sour the experience. Explore! \n\nNot only does the main game have a staggering amount of well-designed levels, but there are free official level packs that add new interactions, objects, and levels. There is also a level editor, and since the community is so huge and full of very clever puzzle designers, there is practically an endless amount of content. \n\nI'm writing this review before I'm truly done the game, but having experienced a good majority of it. Some puzzles are just so insanely hard to think about and I feel like I can keep coming back to this game whenever I need a puzzle, even after the main game. Hopefully the Scenic Pond will fall eventually :^)\n\nHighly recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1691534331, "timestamp_updated": 1691536291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759118020534515381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130663869": {"recommendationid": "130663869", "author": {"steamid": "76561199381320537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2375, "last_played": 1678547580}, "language": "english", "review": "[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]  [/td]\n        [td]Rev\niew[/td]\n        [td]  [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Baba[/td]\n        [td]  is[/td]\n        [td] You[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]  [/td]\n        [td]Good[/td]\n        [td]  [/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nWonderful and frustratingly good all at the same time!", "timestamp_created": 1673477401, "timestamp_updated": 1673478221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757442176342010498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131669818": {"recommendationid": "131669818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253448670", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 7341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7341, "last_played": 1641169603}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficulty : 5/5 (Nightmare)\nGlobal : 5/5 (Perfect)\n\nBaba Is You is an original masterpiece of creativity and puzzle design.\n\nThe goal is simple : you control something that is you (usually Baba) and you have to reach something that is win (usually a flag).

[20/20\u2b50, 60h\ud83c\udfc5 (+40+??\ud83c\udfc5 level packs), 5/5\ud83d\udca1]\n\n[b]Context[/b] Baba is You is a \u201csokoban-style\u201d game where the player controls the properties of all objects in the map. This was not my first run at Baba Is You, I had already completed it back when it came out. But this one still feels special to me, a game so ambitious on its mechanics that it\u2019s surprising it actually works - of course, mostly due to ingenious level design. And, the cherry on top, since I last played free level packs with new mechanics were released that effectively doubled the play time, as well as a level-sharing functionality making it potentially endless.\n\n[b]Writing[/b] There is no actual plot in the game, just some thematically connected areas with different palettes. You can\u2019t even say that (a) BABA is the main character, since by the very nature of the game, everything can (and will) be a playable character. Which doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t feel for the little guy, as he looses its identity, is destroyed, pushed around, duplicated or transformed (it\u2019s not as gory as I\u2019ve made it sound really).\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] The visuals are simplistic, but due to the huge collection of objects it allows for levels with interesting contexts. The wobble effect can get a bit annoying after long play sessions, but can be disabled. The soundtrack is also pretty cool and low key, but inevitably also gets tiring after hours of play (I can\u2019t count the days I\u2019ve spent with different tracks playing on repeat in my head).\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] To put it shortly, each level has a set of objects whose properties are determined by rules that can themselves manipulated in the level. To win, you have to move an object with property YOU (that you can control) into an object with the property WIN. Other objects are affected by a myriad of properties that can be either obstacles or solutions (e.g., STOP objects will block you, PUSH objects can be pushed, MOVE objects move on their own), and solving a level requires both manipulating the objects and the rules affecting them. Rules can also be combined with other rules and have conditions attached. And this applies both to the levels as well as to the world maps, with meta-consequences that I won\u2019t spoil here.\n\nIf this sounds crazy, well, it is. Baba is You is the hardest grid-base game I\u2019ve played, and probably the hardest purely deductive game (won\u2019t compare with those with exploration elements as it\u2019s a different kind of challenge). But it is also incredible fun and satisfying. As all great puzzle games, levels are usually small enough to just require a small eureka step, and not convoluted solutions. Even in the cases where you have to identify bizarre corner cases (such as the order of application of rules), the levels are simple enough that you quickly realize there\u2019s something tricky you\u2019re missing. But this is also a game that should not be rushed - at least I couldn\u2019t. There were often times where I was stuck on all open levels and had to take a break (the game is rather non-linear with multiple worlds open at a time, exploring different mechanics). You can die and hit deadends in a level, but can always undo indefinitely or restart; progress is auto-saved, but the state of each level is not saved.\n\nThe New Adventures level pack is also amazing, featuring both worlds playing around with new weird properties which are pretty fun, and extremely challenging worlds that just build on already existing properties. The Museum level pack has variants of the levels from the main game and levels that were left out by the developer, and has director comments (which I didn\u2019t find particularly interesting to be honest).\n\n[b]Value[/b] I cannot stress enough the value of this game. On the second playthrough I still spent ~50 hours in the >250 levels of the main game (which was for sure higher on my first run); the >150 levels of New Adventures added further 40h of gameplay; I haven\u2019t completed the Museum since I needed a rest from the game, but probably adds a dozen more. (This is without counting the hours spent daydreaming about possible solutions.) And I didn\u2019t even explore the user-designed levels, since the game now features a level editor and a level sharing functionality. You can always revisit previous levels, and there are multiple progress slots. There are multiple endings depending on how far you progress in the game. Achievements are unlocked as you progress the game, and don't really add anything to the experience, and require a single playthrough.\n\n[quote][i]For more puzzle-game reviews and curated lists check out the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43326007-The-Clueless-Adventurer-Puzzle-Trove/]Puzzle Trove[/url].[/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1688943073, "timestamp_updated": 1691618639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71852797269821167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134172201": {"recommendationid": "134172201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406884546", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1679356118}, "language": "english", "review": "BABA IS YOU\nBABA IS CUTE\nGAME IS FUN", "timestamp_created": 1678090164, "timestamp_updated": 1678090739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715961873531341553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140620099": {"recommendationid": "140620099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007065907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 226, "playtime_at_review": 409, "last_played": 1696173330}, "language": "english", "review": "Help, my brain has expanded to the size of entire room, I can't leave.", "timestamp_created": 1687619497, "timestamp_updated": 1687619497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714748919010162354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145237038": {"recommendationid": "145237038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858476259", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1670638208}, "language": "english", "review": "GAME NOT EASY\nME IS STUPID\nBABA IS CUTE\nPLAY IF BRAIN IS BIG", "timestamp_created": 1693281518, "timestamp_updated": 1693281518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704657912254333496", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143337062": {"recommendationid": "143337062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825575204", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3000, "last_played": 1690536847}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\nBaba Is You. Baba Write Review. Game Is Not Half Bad. Review Is You And End.\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\n\nIf you have any programming experience, you can probably guess from the title alone that Baba contains a variable/property definition and type conversion\u2014basic programming stuff\u2014at its core. It may sound like something not that fun for a game, but it is pretty fun when you consider how the game mechanics work, how imaginative it looks, and where your thought process might lead you to solve the puzzles. Although the game should appeal more to programmers because of its problem-solving approach and themes, it has little in common with real-life coding and will not teach you that.\n\nThe game progression looks excellent. For every new concept, there is a concise level that demonstrates how that concept functions before throwing players into a genuine challenge. With a well-planned learning curve and amusing appearance, Baba is nonetheless a hardcore Sokoban-style game. It has many levels, abstract ideas, some nifty meta-games, and several years of expansion and patching behind it (to eliminate more trivial and unwanted paths to victory). As someone who holds a Candidate Master title in chess, I still struggled for several hours at some levels because their solution required thinking outside the box or the rules were not behaving the way I thought they should. There were even times when I was desperate enough to look for hints online to learn that the solution was, in fact, only too brilliant! It does feel like a defeat, so consider not looking for aid but returning to \u201cimpossible levels\u201d later, with a fresh focus. Solving those levels on your own is the best part of it all, and it is not even \u201cdifficult\u201d but merely requires some other point of view. Funnily enough, one of my worst levels (\u201cLove at First Sight\u201d) introduced \u201cbird\u201d objects into the game. I felt personally attacked!\n\nAs for the story and soundtrack, there is nothing worth mentioning. More often than not, I preferred listening to my album queue instead of the in-game music. Completing the game might take anywhere from 40 hours and beyond, and most of that time involves thinking about possible solutions, so I recommend spinning something more appropriate to your tastes.\n\nAchievements do not require dedicated achievement hunting, but they do require solving the whole game, including hard-to-reach secret levels that are not readily available on the map. One has to reach them, which might be even more complicated than solving them.\n\nRest [strike]API[/strike] assured, Baba is an outstanding puzzle game with a simple foundation and an intricate pyramid of progression built atop it. I have always said that great games do not need to rely on sophisticated mechanics. The art of puzzle-making is to convert a basic idea into a gripping experience, and Baba accomplishes that in style. My respects to Finnish developer Arvi Teikari, author of the game.\n\n[quote][i]Follow my curations:[/i]\n[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43571711/]A Crow's Nest[/url] & [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43578955/]Metal Shrike[/url][/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1691083935, "timestamp_updated": 1691655154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703744590282440186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143744482": {"recommendationid": "143744482", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007407833", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1692010180}, "language": "english", "review": "Level Too Hard\nBaba Is Done\nBetter Look Out\nBaba Has Gun", "timestamp_created": 1691619167, "timestamp_updated": 1691619167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69856107234954834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132589529": {"recommendationid": "132589529", "author": {"steamid": "76561199128038230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1690750972}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, while extremely difficult, has a simple and intuitive game concept.

I'm writing this review after beating every level available currently[spoiler]( 231 in total)[/spoiler]. I'll also say that I had to look up the solution to a few levels, because some levels didn't make sense to me even after knowing the solution, which I'll elaborate on later in the review.\n\nWHAT IS BABA\n\nBaba is You is a Sokoban* -like game where your goal is to rearrange words to satisfy or create a winning condition by establishing rules.\u00a0\nThe most common are :\u00a0\nBABA IS YOU and FLAG IS WIN, meaning if Baba(you) occupies the same tile as Flag(win), the level is considered completed, but you could swap the words and make :\u00a0\nFLAG IS YOU and BABA IS WIN meaning that your goal now is to reach Baba as Flag to win.\nThroughout the game, you will encounter more words and more possible combinations to solve levels.\n\nGAME IS PLAY\n\nAs already stated, the game is divided into singular levels and most of them can be solved in under a minute if the player knows the solution. The levels are accessed on a world map, represented by an island. You can move around the world map and travel to different zones, which serve as hubs*\u00b2. The game does not require you to finish every level to advance to the next area. Upon entering a hub, you can always see the number of levels required to unlock a \"key item\". New zones are unlocked by just having a certain amount of \"key items\", so the player doesn't need to decide which area they want to unlock next.\n\nTHING IS GOOD\n\n[list]\n[*]One of my personal favorite things in the game is it's art style, as everything in the game is easy to identify and understand, with the added bonus of being able to run on almost any computer.\n[*]Levels where new mechanics are introduced are easy and let you play around with the rules to give you a basic understanding of them.\n[*]The \"undo\" button helps a lot, since it's easy to make a mistake in the game and not having to restart the entire level each time is great.\n[*]Most levels are designed pretty well and sometimes give hints on how to solve them, without it being shoved in your face and looking unnatural.[/list]\n\nTHING IS BAD\n\n[list]\n[*]The difficulty of the game is insane in some cases; it ramps up from some levels so quickly, that you don't even have time to learn how to use a mechanic properly and the game already expects you to know every possible interaction.*\u00b3\n[*]A few words have the issue of being hard to use or comprehend, as the introductory level only shows you a few possible interactions, which makes the easy introductory levels a double-edged sword.\n[*]Some levels verge on trial and error, as some mechanics don't seem possible when you first encounter them.\nThere are some interactions in the game that look like the dev was just messing around in a sandbox trying to find the most obscure interactions possible and made them into a level without giving you the opportunity to see them in action.\n\n[*]Now, my personal biggest problem with the game is the cumulation of the above to some extent:\nYou would think a game about breaking rules and remaking them would have a lot of freedom for making solutions, but it's the exact opposite; after a certain point in the game, you are restrained from doing the majority of interactions.\u00a0\nIf you somehow manage to find an unintended solution, chances are that the dev will just update the level to make that solution not possible anymore, meaning the game turns from \"think outside the box\" to \"think inside the developer's box; otherwise, you're just exploiting the game's mechanics\".\nIn my personal opinion, you should have the decency as a puzzle developer to admit when you have been outsmarted, but I guess changing the level to make your solution the only one is sort of meta in a twisted way.[/list]\n\nTHOUGHTS IS FINAL\n\nAs you see, I've written a lot more about the negative aspects of the game, but I still do recommend it, as it is a very unique game and despite all the issues with it, I still had a lot of fun with it, and the feeling of being a genius after solving a level is more than worth the frustration in some parts.\n\nREVIEW IS END\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n* \u00a0- Sokoban (eng. \"warehouse keeper\") from 1982 is also known as a \"Box pushing\" puzzle game where you have to push a box on a specific tile on the map. Many games since it's original release have implemented it as a mini-game; a lot of these games are of Japanese origin.\n\n*\u00b2 \u00a0- Hub refers to a zone that houses a set of levels with the same visual aesthetic and theme; these levels quite often introduce a new word or mechanic that is expanded upon throughout the entire zone and the rest of the game in some cases.\n\n*\u00b3\u00a0 - Queue all the people saying :\"Maybe the game is too hard for you.\" or \"You are just mad cuz bad\", even though almost all of them didn't even finish the game or didn't even finish every level in most zones (according to Steam achievements at least), meaning they have no frame of reference of how hard the levels in this game can get.", "timestamp_created": 1689844501, "timestamp_updated": 1690019839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680582761764526367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133039369": {"recommendationid": "133039369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278411842", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_at_review": 31833, "last_played": 1695898138}, "language": "english", "review": "Baba Is You is not just the best game I ever played, it is something else, I cant even put into words how much I love this game, the difficulty is astounding, but so is the level design and concepts, it really is like nothing you ever played.

It starts off simple enough, but the difficulty ramps up somewhat quickly \u2013 though, with fairness. It\u2019s also a long game, reportedly with over 200 puzzles in total. At the time of this review, I\u2019ve only solved 51 puzzles (with help) and unlocked the first of two endings.\n\nWhat I particularly enjoyed about [I]Baba is You[/I] is the hacker spirit it embodies. You solve each puzzle or level by manipulating the level\u2019s rules, which are formed by tiles of nouns (e.g., \u201cBaba\u201d, \u201crock\u201d, \u201cwall\u201d), operators (e.g., \u201cis\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201cnot\u201d) and properties (e.g., \u201cmove\u201d, \u201cpush\u201d, \u201cwin\u201d). By moving and swapping these tiles, you can change the rules, and modify your environment, yourself and the conditions for winning. There are often multiple solutions to each puzzle, making the game highly replayable.\n\nIt was very satisfying to solve a puzzle on my own after taking the level apart so to speak, putting it back together with new rules, and making the environment work to my advantage. By the second sub-world, I started to need help. [I]Baba is You[/I] is not a casual brainteaser (well, for me anyway), and demands (pretty much) your full attention each time you play it.\n\nAlthough [I]Baba is You[/I] is fun and delightfully challenging, I found it too long, too daunting, and in some ways too repetitive. Right now, I want a game that is quick to pick up and put down, and casual to play but not overly easy; one that can be played in short bursts and completed in several hours. [I]Baba is You[/I] [B]IS[/B] that type of puzzle game in the first couple of sub-worlds, but not once you\u2019ve reached sub-world 3 (of 10).\n\nSo while I\u2019m a not a genius and couldn\u2019t breeze through this game in several hours, I still recognize it as a gem. Another way of looking at its long length, high difficulty and large number of puzzles is that you know this game is of great value even at regular price.\n\n[I]Baba is You[/I] is one of those games that I\u2019ll chip away at once in a while if I find myself in between games or bored with one. I recommend you adding it to your collection \u2013 power through it or work at it a bit at time, whichever suits your play and lifestyle \u2013 and enjoy the fun and challenges it offers.

Combine that with the fact that the rules are easy to learn, and you are encouraged to break them as soon as you learn them, and Baba Is You has all the markings of a fun, novel puzzle game.

It's a puzzle game by Arvi \"Hempuli\" Teikari where the rules are literally part of the game world, and you get to remix them to solve each stage.\n\nThe puzzles are set in small 2D spaces with various objects, characters, and words that define the rules. For example, you start with a white rabbit (Baba), a yellow flag, and some rocks between two walls. The rules written on the stage include \"Baba Is You,\" \"Flag Is Win,\" \"Wall Is Stop,\" and \"Rock Is Push.\"\n\nNow, the cool part is that every word on the screen is a movable tile. So you can rearrange them to your advantage. For instance, you can push the \"Win\" tile to change \"Rock Is Push\" to \"Rock Is Win,\" and now you can complete the puzzle by touching the rock.\n\nOr, you can change \"Wall Is Stop\" to \"Wall Is\" by removing \"Stop,\" allowing your bunny to walk through the walls. There's a bunch of creative ways to manipulate the rules to your benefit.\n\nBaba Is You finds joy in the concept of rules, which might sound odd at first. But rules are the backbone of great games\u2014they create predictability and help us master the game's mechanics. In Baba Is You, you not only see the rules but also get to modify them, prompting you to question your assumptions about how games should work.\n\nI love how this game challenges me to think differently. Sometimes, when I'm stuck on a puzzle, I take a break, do something else, and suddenly, the solution clicks in my mind.

It's one of the types of puzzle games that I think are very deliberate, which doesn't always translate to \"good\" but does show a lot of planning behind the scenes. There are some surprising, and in my opinion very funny, hidden \"easter eggs\" (they are technically part of the main game but are miss-able if you're not experimental) that are interesting. The rules across all levels are consistent but do require experimentation to figure out.\n\nI do think the game should have a little more handholding or an easily accessible way to test new knowledge (the level designer is very good for this, but runs into the issue that it's easy to spoil yourself for things you haven't encountered yet). But compared to some other popular puzzle games, I almost never get annoyed after solving a puzzle. (A good, uncontroversial counter example is old point-and-click adventures where you realize the solution was some stray pixel that you couldn't figure out without outside help or an immense amount of patience).\n\nI think if the screenshots look appealing to you, it's worth getting. If you're on the fence, it might be worth getting on sale (usually 25-30% off during the major sale seasons).", "timestamp_created": 1693367611, "timestamp_updated": 1693367611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145267963": {"recommendationid": "145267963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056844412", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1693770822}, "language": "english", "review": "Ollie was Oliver", "timestamp_created": 1693324857, "timestamp_updated": 1693324857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144565636": {"recommendationid": "144565636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387516250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1622, "last_played": 1692814214}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the good stuff", "timestamp_created": 1692452803, "timestamp_updated": 1692452803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143588800": {"recommendationid": "143588800", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215571799", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "playtime_at_review": 8079, "last_played": 1696155622}, "language": "english", "review": "no one knows how keke is spelled like", "timestamp_created": 1691415237, "timestamp_updated": 1691415237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143442820": {"recommendationid": "143442820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065987586", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 930, "last_played": 1691763306}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't believe I paid to enjoy suffering the game causes me.\n\nPUZZLE IS PUZZLE AND HARD", "timestamp_created": 1691226978, "timestamp_updated": 1691227074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143300437": {"recommendationid": "143300437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123214982", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1694235682}, "language": "english", "review": "Sits next to portal 1+2 under my \"Favorite puzzle games of all time\".

Easily.\nThis game uses its clever mechanic of text setting the in-game rules of the world and lets you interact with and rewrite the rules of the world. Baba doesn't have to be You. Rock can be Win. Flag can be Death. Skull can be Sink. There are zero conventional limits. The only things that can stop you are the map geometry and your own imagination.\nYou'll use this incredibly cool idea to solve some of the toughest puzzles I've ever seen, and progress through the heartwarming, fun, and strange world of Baba.

There is nothing hidden from sight - all the information you need to solve the level is directly presented to you. It's very much a case of show and not tell: the game teaches you how different rules interact with each other by using them in puzzles. There are often several ways to do a level, none of them better or worse than others.\n\nThe level design is great, starting with relatively straightforward puzzles introducing basic interactions, and slowly ramping up towards the end, having some absolutely fiendish puzzles towards the end. Despite the insane difficulty towards the end, it rarely felt unfairly difficult. The answers were always there to be figured out, and with enough creativity and trying things out, they were always doable. It was rare for the solution to be a stretch.\n\nThe amount of content is staggering too, especially for the price. Even in the base game, there are enough puzzles to last 50+ hours, and that's before considering workshop level packs, which includes an official levelpack introducing many more blocks and almost as many levels as the base game.\n\nOverall, one of the best puzzle games ever made.

In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.", "timestamp_created": 1645311472, "timestamp_updated": 1645311472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897528111934661865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49537129": {"recommendationid": "49537129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004725611", "num_games_owned": 610, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1648503765}, "language": "english", "review": "(BABA) {IS} [GOOD]\n\nBaba Is You is a deceptively simple puzzle game. (BABA) {IS} [YOU] and you control [YOU] with the arrow keys on a two-dimensional field. All you have to do is get to [WIN]. Simple.\n\nThe distinction, of course, is you control [YOU]. (BABA) {IS} [YOU], but what if (WALL) {IS} [YOU]? Well, you'll control walls. And if (BABA) {AND} (WALL) {IS} [YOU]? Well you control Baba and the walls. See, the properties of all the objects in the game are objects themselves, able to be pushed and manipulated by [YOU]. (LAVA) {IS} [DEFEAT]? Just push away the {IS} and walk across the lava. (FLAG) {IS} [WIN], but the flag is unreachable? Push in an object and make it (LAVA) {IS} [WIN], then touch any spot of lava to win the level.\n\nThe simplicity of the concept, but the complexity of the interactions is what makes Baba Is You a great puzzle game. There's no obscure properties to remember, 'gotchas' of game minutiae that you'll only figure out by reading a walkthrough. The only thing to really remember is you move [YOU], and all other properties are subject to change, stated at the start of each level. You could go away for two months, and return to Baba Is You and still have a good idea on how to solve the puzzles presented.\n\nThe ability to change the rules is why (BABA) {IS} [GOOD]. But the interactions is why (BABA) {IS} [GENIUS].\n\nFor example, you may not be able to change (WALL) {IS} [STOP]. It's pushed against the edge of the level, and can't be separated. But the properties themselves are still objects. You can use that (WALL) and push in {IS} [FLOAT] to walk under the walls. (WATER) {IS} [SINK], (ROCK) {IS} [PUSH], but there's only one rock? Go ahead and push (ROCK) {IS} [PUSH] into the water to make a bridge; [SINK] takes any object after all. What if (DOOR) {IS} [SHUT] {AND} [OPEN]? What if (TEXT) {IS} [DEFEAT]? What if (BABA) {IS} (BABA)?\n\nWhile interactions with objects and their properties are near endless, the baseline mechanics of the game remain simple, and what the properties actually do remain static. Because of this, all the interactions you learn within the game come naturally, rather than feeling forced. This allows the game to stay approachable and intuitive, while still allowing a great amount of depth and complexity to the puzzles presented.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game that you can either binge in one day, or play an hour or so across a month, Baba Is You makes for a great pickup in both cases.\n\nJust make sure that, at all times, something, anything, {IS} [YOU].", "timestamp_created": 1552504557, "timestamp_updated": 1552504557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897116720676422119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74645192": {"recommendationid": "74645192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004614086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1533, "last_played": 1653955835}, "language": "english", "review": "GAME IS HARD\nIS\nFUN", "timestamp_created": 1597977029, "timestamp_updated": 1597977029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.896639466285705566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110441958": {"recommendationid": "110441958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136507146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2364, "last_played": 1668362168}, "language": "english", "review": "This game feels a lot like debugging some code. \nYou analyze what is going on in the level. \nYou try some solutions.

So. Stupid. In the face of some of the puzzles this one throws at you. Each level is brilliant, devious, maddening, and each one also usually teaches you a different clever trick about how to manipulate word combinations or world objects.\n\nPut your sudoku work book away, THIS is how you get to Big Brain Time.\n\nDespite this seemingly severe appraisal, I really love this game. The spritework is cute. The music is simple, pleasant, and unobtrusive, a perfect tempo for your brain to grind its gears so while you ponder. The game's options are pretty comprehensive- want the world to stop wiggling? Checkbox for that. Want it to stop its animations too? Checkbox. Fullscreen? Ye. Windowed fullscreen? Ye. Music? Begone. Warning menu for restarting a level? Up to you!\n\nThe game world moves in ticks and only ticks when you move or take a wait action, so you can sit there and stare dumbly at the puzzle before for as long as you'd like. If you've pushed a block or object somewhere you don't want it to be, there's an undo button that rolls you back a tick every time you press it, all the way to the very start of the level. Instead of mistakes requiring restarts, it asks you to do little rollbacks instead, and so the time to fix things is literally in seconds. Your inputs are in four directions, to wait a turn, and to undo. That's the entirety of the controls of the game (well, and the restart button, but), and there is a massive, maddening collection of truly brilliant puzzles built on that.\n\nIt boots up quick, every puzzle is self-contained, there's no time constraint, and the fundamentals of the game are all simple enough that you can pick it up and put it down literally any time you want. Ten minutes to pluck at a puzzle before work? Got it. Leave it on in the background while you muse over it while preparing dinner? You can do that. Gotta step away to feed Baby? The world wiggles on, but waits right there for you. Haven't played in three months? Right there where you left it, and everything is familiar again.\n\nAnd that's it, really. Six buttons, a little over two hundred puzzles, a bunch of wiggly sprites, and some words to push around. It's brilliant at every step.\n\nFull recommendation. Buy it full price.

It's not like there's anything inherently wrong with them, I'm just usually not smart enough for them. Or not patient enough. To grab my attention and to keep me playing, a puzzle game has to be something special.\nThe last few years were pretty good for puzzle games. There were a lot of them and many were good. But only two of them were special enough for me.\n\nOne is [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/simoncleric/recommended/558990]Opus Magnum[/url]. The amount of satisfaction you get from it and the sheer willpower you need to have to not spam your friends with the gifs of your creations made it one of my favorite puzzles ever made.\n\nThe other is... well... it's Baba.\nBaba is amazing. It's cute. It's fun. It either makes you feel incredibly smart or incredibly stupid, but it's always incredible. There is often more than one solution for a problem, which is awesome, because different people may think differently and find their own approaches. The whole idea to change the rules of the world is just brilliant. It makes you think outside the box.\nI especially love the levels that have the same layout but different rules (although don't worry, the level variety is pretty big, the repetition is rare and very intentional). It breaks your mind, but in the right and very satisfying way.\nBaba makes you think about what elements you should use, what elements you can't use at all and what elemets are there to distract you. It's very simple at it's core, but not easy. It's mechanics are intuitive, but it keeps adding new ones as you play to keep things fresh.\n\nI wish I had more to say about this game. I honestly can't find a single flaw with it. I like it visually, I like the music, I like the gameplay. But there's nothing I can add that will make you buy this game. You either love what you see already, in the screenshots and videos on both Steam and Youtube, or you don't and it's also fine. You just need to find your own puzzle game, something that will click with you personally, like Baba did with me. \n\nBut if you like what you see and still hesitate - don't.

If \"Baba is you\" and \"flag is win\", you control Baba (a white animal, possibly a cat) and you need to touch the flag.\n \nBut what if Baba and the flag are on opposite sides of a stream, and \"water is sink\"? As soon as you touch the water, you'll die. You could push \"sink\" away from the other words, and safely walk across the water. But what if \"water is sink\" is on the other side of a wall, alongside \"wall is stop\"? Now you can't get close enough to rearrange those words. \n \nPerhaps there's a way to make something other than the flag be win. Or maybe you don't have to control Baba. This is where the enjoyment of this game begins, as you start rearranging words to experiment with different rules.\n \nThe main puzzle mechanic is easy to understand, but the complexity comes from all the different words that appear in later puzzles, including \"shut\", \"open\", \"move\", \"defeat\", \"float\", \"hot\", \"melt\", and many more. You can transform an object into something else. You can control more than one thing simultaneously. You can set up an object to push blocks into position while you do something else. Eventually you'll make rules using more than three words. The level design is genius.\n \nThere are more than 150 puzzles to solve, and the world map is arranged so that at any time you'll have access to 10 or more puzzles. This means that when you get stuck, instead of getting frustrated, you can try a different puzzle, and come back to the other one later with fresh ideas. The later puzzles become very challenging, but they feel great when you finally figure them out.\n \nYou don't need to solve every puzzle in an area to unlock access to the next one, or to finish the game, but the more you solve the more achievements you'll earn.

It has a programming \"feel\" to it - and it certainly has that Turing-completeness - but it's not at all like the games which are a game UI slapped on top of a simple programming language. And it is so META.\n\nIt really brought me back to the days when I did math contests, when I would keep thinking about problems away from the desk and suddenly have an \"aha!\" moment.

Surely you won't let a random internet stranger one-up you, right?\n\nMore seriously: This game is basically \"Think Outside Of The Box: The Game\". In almost every one of the [spoiler]226[/spoiler] levels, you're given a box to think your way out of. You start with some nice boxes, moving on to more evil boxes one by one. New mechanics are introduced throughout the game, and the game wastes no time at all forcing you to use them in several utterly unorthodox ways each.\n\nThe game has a very nonlinear worldmap, so if you get stuck on a few levels you can just go complete some other levels instead, then come back with a fresh outlook and an epiphany waiting for you. You'll definitely be happy about this nonlinearity, because this game, more than any other game, has the unique ability to make you think \"This level is literally impossible\". You don't just get the feeling that it's just very hard and you haven't found the solution yet, you literally think \"Yep, there's absolutely no way this can be done.\" You're always wrong, of course. The correct statement would probably be \"Yep, there's absolutely no way this can be done using the techniques I am aware of\". So you need a new technique, a new approach. And guess what: The new approach is [i]always[/i] outside the box. Sometimes outside several boxes at once.\n\nThe game is not unfair. The rules of the game are ridiculously simple. To solve the puzzles, you need to learn to [i]understand them[/i]. For each word in the game, you need to understand two things: what the word means, and what the word [i]doesn't[/i] mean. The game loves to mess with your preconceptions like that: for example if there's nothing on screen meaning \"LAVA IS HOT\", then lava isn't hot, no matter how intimidating it looks.\n\nIf you're out of ideas on some level, try to think backwards. What needs to be where for YOU to WIN? What needs to happen to achieve that? Very often, the game wants you to plan ahead and build a certain setup, one you can't just find through trial and error, but one that becomes way more obvious when you think about what needs to have been done.\n\nLater on in the game, you'll notice that the game has secretly begun to build more boxes around you while you were playing it. It lulls you in, repeatedly shows you things you'll come to expect, acts like there is an underlying structure to things beyond just the written rules. And then... it just starts subverting your expectations, mercilessly, one by one, [i]without even breaking any of its rules[/i]. It's absolutely magnificent to experience, and it's all your own fault for believing there are limits in the first place.\n\nThe game has an unlimited undo feature, and it's the one feature you'll use most in the game. You will live the undo, breathe it. It is a good feature.\n\nNow get to it, buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1558466195, "timestamp_updated": 1587666150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860621392726898193", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97490036": {"recommendationid": "97490036", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969759305", "num_games_owned": 1320, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1643857506}, "language": "english", "review": "baba is fun\nis\nhard", "timestamp_created": 1628866639, "timestamp_updated": 1628866639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 55, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860555112361907959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64784178": {"recommendationid": "64784178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981667482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 52330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40423, "last_played": 1691552465}, "language": "english", "review": "You will grow to hate this game, it's inevitable. \n\nThere's something deceptively simple about the difficulty.

It's sleek, simple, and easy to pick up and understand. It's also deceptively difficult, to the point that the game becomes mentally taxing to play. After the initial puzzles, the game ramps up the difficulty to the extreme, making the overall game laborious to complete. Only the most dedicated of puzzlers will enjoy this.[/b]\n\n\nThe game is about solving puzzles by remixing common phrases to change the logic of the game. Rather than solve the puzzles in a straight forward manner, you have to shift things around in order to carve a path to the goal. Sometimes this might involve taking control of another character, changing the goal to be something else, deleting certain elements blocking your path, or even manipulating abstract concepts. \n\nIt's been described as \"programmer-y\", though I would describe it as \"semantic-y\". It's not in the same vein as Space Chem, Infinifactory, or 7 Billion Humans, where you're altering a sequence that has to execute in real time. It's more like you're editing static settings values at specific locations. If there is code \"executing\", you're inside the sequence that's being executed. If that sounds utterly confusing, ignore the previous statements.\n\n\nBaba Is You is definitely brilliant, there is no doubt about that. The mechanics are simple yet mind-bending, the presentation is clean, and the overall game feels smooth to play.\n\nHowever, it fails primarily in execution. While the gameplay is easy to pick up and parse, the game ramps up the difficulty from a tiny incline to a vertical wall roughly 10% into the game, and does so in the most frustrating and tedious ways possible. Once you clear the early stages, expect to spend at least an hour on a single puzzle.\n\n\nIt took me a while to really wrap my head around why the game became so difficult. I kept hopping around, or coming back to previous stages, or skipping sections entirely to make progress. With each puzzle, my eyes would glaze over as I took in all the variables and impediments. I'd block out an idea in my head, only to hit some proverbial wall that the developer had actively placed. I'd get half way to a solution, only to have a tiny detail invalidate the whole attempt. I'd restart, over and over, getting more worn down as the game threw out edge case after edge case at me.\n\nEventually, I realized I wasn't having any fun at all. In fact, during the first few stages, when my eyes were wide and my imagination was open, I was quite enthusiastic about playing. Once that faded, I stopped looking forward to puzzles, and instead looked for excuses to quit. It became a blackhole that I'd boot up, where my fun went to die.\n\nI've played a lot of puzzle games, both easy and hard. I'd like to think I'm competent enough at the genre to know when something isn't fun.\n\n\nPuzzle games are about reaching solutions using analysis or trial and error. As I see it, there are two types of reasonable puzzles. Those with one solution, and few variables; or those with many solutions, and many variables. Deviation from this introduces too much noise into the puzzle, making it far more difficult to solve.\n\nBaba Is You's puzzles have only one intended solution, and are rigidly bulletproofed against any sort of creativity. Despite being a game about reinventing the rules, you're really just retracing the developer's intended path. If you don't see the puzzle the same way they do, then you'll have to keep retrying until you do. You're not thinking outside the box, you're thinking inside the developer's box.\n\nBaba Is You's puzzle structure has too many steps and too many things to keep track of. You're trying to solve a puzzle with a large number of possible moves and variations, with no capacity to improvise. You'll spend 30 minutes devising a solution only for the last step to fail, just because it's not \"the\" solution. To make matters worse, some puzzles require a setup that naturally cascades into the solution over the course of several moves. Good luck formulating those.\n\nIf that weren't enough, many of these puzzles also rely on quirks that you'd only discover by pure luck. A new block will be introduced with a patronizly easy puzzle, and then afterwards ramp up to the point of absurdity. Once I realized that certain puzzles were unsolvable unless you knew a specific strategy, I began future puzzles with the nagging sense that I wasn't equipped to solve them. How am I supposed to walk the logic back when I don't know if you're going to be using the same rules you taught me in the previous examples?\n\n\nIf the game's puzzles were small, one solution would be fine. If the game was open-ended, and you could solve in any way you could make it work, then having complex puzzles would be acceptable. If the quirky behaviour was better telegraphed or implied, rather than undetectable until you waste multiple hours on a seemingly \"impossible\" puzzle, then unexpected behaviour would be welcome. \n\nTo marry one solution with such complexity, while also introducing rules with obscure behaviour, makes this tedious and mentally exhausting to solve.\n\nI must stress, this is not a slight against the actual concept of Baba Is You. I have no problem with manipulating the game's logic using semantics. I think this idea is genius, I just wish it was executed in a way where I would get to experience more than 20% of the game. These puzzles did not need to be this challenging, or at the very least, not until the very end of the game.\n\n\nThe game boasts 220 puzzles, and I have no doubt that there are people out there who will enjoy it. I also realize there are people out there who see entire ultra hard crossword or sudoku books as hundreds of hours of fun. People who enjoy replaying the old text-based adventure games with extremely strict semantics. People who enjoy running through all of the Chip's Challenge games back to back. Does any of that sound appealing? Then this is probably THE game for you.\n\nIf not... run far away. Only frustration, exhaustion, and regret await.\n\n\nI feel bad giving a negative rating to a game that displays such brilliance and purity of form. Perhaps if it weren't so blindingly hard, or tedious, or rigid, or obtuse, or mentally taxing, I could see myself giving this an easy masterpiece grade. In it's current state, it's far too challenging to complete. Its solutions are too specific, too cavernous, and too obscure to decode. To some people, this might as well be a positive review touting a game that is the epitome of puzzling excellence. I consider it a warning, mainly to ward off those mere mortals who fancy themselves as puzzlers.\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33370076/]Steam Curator[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1581114130, "timestamp_updated": 1581114161, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819787263870239258", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49918466": {"recommendationid": "49918466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205741643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1632982731}, "language": "english", "review": "GA\nME\n\nIS\n\nHA\nRD", "timestamp_created": 1554247131, "timestamp_updated": 1554247131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 171, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819437742233276367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76351636": {"recommendationid": "76351636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049990197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1677205821}, "language": "english", "review": "I spent an hour hating myself and accomplishing nothing in this game today.

I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone interested in problems that require lateral thinking.\n\nBaba is You is a block-pushing game, at least superficially. A classic kind of puzzler with plenty of challenges in its own right. But Baba is You offers a twist on this mechanic that is so all-encompassing that it may as well be its own genre of game, with block-pushing taking the backseat.\n\nEvery level carries its own rules, typically including \"Baba is You\". So long as those are connected, you control Baba. Perhaps \"Wall is Stop\" will be there as well. So long as they are connected, walls are impassable. The trick is that they don't have to stay connected. Often, you'll be forced to form your own rules in such a way as to make the level beatable or even break rules!\n\nIt's in this that we find the genius of Baba is You. Puzzles are devilishly simple, but require constant rethinking of how the game's logic works, something unaccustomed to most people. Every level asks you to reconsider how you thought things worked and find ways to make things work in such a way that you can win. The challenge is almost entirely in conception: thinking of what the mind-bending solution is. It's never a trial and error challenge of trying every combination and order, but of figuring out exactly what the challenge really is for that level.\n\nAdd to this, a pleasant aesthetic with calm music and a charmingly simple gameplay system, Baba is You really has no disappointing aspect for me. Reading the negative reviews, the consensus seems to be that the faults are that the game is underexplained or that interactions are often unpredictable and unclear or that the main mechanic isn't used sufficiently. I can't say that I agree with these faults.\n\nBaba is You really doesn't need explaining: any explaining would just diminish what makes it interesting. Every level that has a new text block makes you excited to see what it does, how you can use it and what to make of it. The entire appeal of Baba is You is the slow mastering of every level by experimentation and abstract thinking.\n\nUnpredictable and unclear interactions in a game about changing the mechanics of the game seems to be trying to have your cake and eat it to me. I fail to see how a game that is about constantly shaking up how the game works could have ONLY obvious and intuitive interactions. To me, the unclear and unpredictable is part of the fun. You are often cast into the deep end and have to try to think your way out.\n\nFinally, not using the main mechanic comes up in some reviews, usually accompanied by saying that later levels often have stationary text that cannot be changed out. While I admit that this can seem superficially disappointing, it's ultimately what leads to actually compelling and interesting puzzles. With some locked rules, Baba is You forces you to play around those limitations which can themselves be changed from level to level. If every level was just about changing the rules of the game and allowing all text to be interacted with, solutions would likely just default to whatever the player last used to beat a level.\n\nSo in short, I think this is possibly a perfect game and that the criticisms of it that appear here are not really applicable. If that doesn't tell you that I recommend it, let me say this:\n\nBaba is You\nGame is Great and Buy", "timestamp_created": 1566118980, "timestamp_updated": 1566118980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815567433834075928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107286751": {"recommendationid": "107286751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828101328", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6546, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2141, "last_played": 1654856253}, "language": "english", "review": "I paid 11 dollars to feel stupid for 35 hours. 12/10", "timestamp_created": 1641286961, "timestamp_updated": 1641287272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815292894840240479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51266496": {"recommendationid": "51266496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002117677", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9249, "last_played": 1666460844}, "language": "english", "review": "There are not many single player games that I've played for more than 100 hours - it is one of them, and it is not a game made by some large company.

I\u2019ve had this on my radar for a little while, and despite not being particularly good at puzzle games I knew this would be a day one purchase for me. The easiest way to understand how the game works is to watch the trailer, I\u2019m just here to tell you how bloody fantastic this game is (even if you\u2019re not particularly good at puzzles).\n\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\n[list][*]The art and animations are quite simple, but I think they look great and suit the game. The colours are well selected I\u2019d say.\n\n[*]The way puzzles work here is just fantastic. Baba is You works around rules. Each level has different rules, some can be changed, and some can\u2019t. The puzzles in this game are all about manipulating the rules you\u2019re presented with in order to meet the win condition (which in some cases you can change). The reason I like it all so much, is because the solution is always sitting in front of you. There are no hidden rules, and the game is quite good at teaching you new mechanics, you just have to figure out what to put where in order to win. Having everything on the screen in front of you also makes it a little less daunting for players who aren't as good at puzzle games, that's certainly the way I've felt with it.\n\n[*]Baba is You makes you feel so incredibly smart when you finally finish a level. Even with the \u2018tutorial\u2019 section at the beginning, I felt really good about solving the puzzles. I quite quickly reached a point where I was having a hard time with each level, but the satisfaction of beating a level is just great. I desperately want to beat this game, and its not often that I feel that way.\n\n[*]Obviously I\u2019m nowhere near beating the game yet, but the level variety has been excellent so far. Not only that, but all of the levels have been consistently excellent. There is a lot of content here, according to the store page there\u2019s 200 levels and after three hours I\u2019m only 20 levels in. I\u2019m sure the time taken to beat each level continues to increase as you progress through the game as well. \n\n[*]This really is one of those games that sticks with you. When I was playing this with my girlfriend last night, we got stuck on a particular level, and I\u2019ve been thinking about it since, trying to figure out a way I could make it work and beat the level. Again, there aren\u2019t many games that stick with me that much.\n\n[*]Baba doesn\u2019t have any kind of co-op mode or anything, but it\u2019s great fun to play with a partner. As I mentioned, I\u2019ve played some of it with my girlfriend and it was really fun to try and figure out the levels together. And because Baba has quite a simple, rule-based premise, it\u2019s really easy for other people to pick up. In fact, my girlfriend was immediately better at solving the puzzles than I was.\n\n[*]As well as giving you the ability to reset you can undo moves too! This is super helpful, especially for the longer levels. It's really easy to push a word into a place where you can't move it, having undo has saved me a lot of restarts.\n\n[*]10% of the money that the dev earns from the game goes to charity, givingwhatwecan.org to be precise. Not often you see something like that outside of HumbleBundle, I think it\u2019s great that the dev is donating some of his earnings from this. [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n[list][*]This is purely because I\u2019m bad at puzzle games, but I feel like having some kind of hint system would have been a good inclusion. Perhaps triggered by spending a certain amount of time on one level. I don\u2019t want to have to look up the solutions to levels, but occasionally I would have liked a hint. \n\n[*]This is really minor, but the cursor doesn't disappear despite not being used whether you're playing KB or gamepad. I just find that annoying.[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\n\nBaba is You is absolutely fantastic, and most definitely one of the best puzzle games I\u2019ve played. I love the rule-based puzzles and it\u2019s one of those games that I can\u2019t stop thinking about. If you have ever enjoyed a puzzle game, then this is an absolute must have, even at full price. This is certainly an early consideration for my personal game of the year title.

For this rule to be true, properties must be attached to a noun from the right or bottom, never from the left or top. \n[quote]\n[b]Noun[/b] - Baba\n[b]Operator[/b] - is\n[b]Property[/b] - You\n\n[b][i]Baba[/i][/b]\u200e \u200e\u200e\u200e[i]is[/i]\u200e \u200e[b][i]You[/i][/b] \u2714\ufe0f\n[b][i]You[/i][/b]\u200e \u200e[i]is[/i]\u200e \u200e[b][i]Baba[/i][/b] \u274c\n\n[b][i]Baba[/i][/b] \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e   \n    \u200e \u200e \u200e [i]is[/i]  \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e  \n[b][i]You[/i][/b] \u2714\ufe0f \n  \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e  \u200e \u200e  \n[b][i]You[/i][/b] \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e     \n    \u200e \u200e [i]is[/i]  \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \n[b][i]Baba[/i][/b] \u274c       \n[/quote]\n\nThe second type uses only nouns and operators. Stacking nouns can produce some fun and unexpected gameplay changes. For example creating a [b][i]noun A[/i][/b] [i]is[/i] [b][i]noun B[/i][/b] rule turns object A into object B. So keep in mind the priority order and what the end result is.\n[quote]\n[b]Noun[/b] - Baba\n[b]Noun[/b] - Wall\n[b]Operator[/b] - is \n\n[b][i]Baba[/i][/b]\u200e [i]is[/i]\u200e [b][i]Wall[/i][/b]  \n[b]Effect[/b]: Every Baba becomes Wall\n\n[b][i]Wall[/i][/b]\u200e [i]is[/i]\u200e [b][i]Baba[/i][/b]\n[b]Effect[/b]: Every Wall becomes Baba\n[/quote]\n\n[b][i]Do what You want[/i][/b] - [b][i]Properties[/i][/b] determine the role of a noun. They can only connect to nouns from the right and bottom. Some properties can also stack, producing some unexpected results. It works the same way as it does for nouns. They can be stacked in any direction and require specific operators. The difference is that this combination of just properties doesn't have any effect on gameplay until it's assigned to a noun.\n[quote]\n[b]Noun[/b] - Baba\n[b]Property[/b] - You\n[b]Property[/b] - Hot\n[b]Operator[/b] - is\n[b]Operator[/b] - and \n\n[b][i]You[/i][/b]\u200e [i]is[/i]\u200e [b][i]Hot[/i][/b] \u274c  \n[b][i]You[/i][/b]\u200e [i]and[/i]\u200e [b][i]Hot[/i][/b] \u274c \nWithout a noun, this isn't registered as a rule\n\n[b][i]Baba[/i][/b]\u200e [i]is[/i]\u200e [b][i]You[/i][/b]\u200e [i]is[/i]\u200e\u200e [b][i]Hot[/i][/b] \u274c \nWhile a noun is present, now the operator connecting the two properties isn't the correct one\n\n[b][i]Baba[/i][/b]\u200e [i]is[/i]\u200e [b][i]You[/i][/b]\u200e [i]and[/i]\u200e\u200e [b][i]Hot[/i][/b]\u2714\ufe0f\nThe is a rule now, with every aspect being satisfied - a noun is present and the properties are connected with a correct operator\n[/quote]\n\n[b]Hello, operator?[/b] - Words slotted in-between nouns and properties, showing the relation between them are called [b][i]operators[/i][/b].

X interacts with Y, and you win. Easy...Finding the solution? Well, not so much. So experiment with different word combinations and see all the effects these new rules you created have on gameplay.\n\n[h3][b][i]Why do numbers deceive me?[/i][/b][/h3]\nThere are ten worlds, each adding more nouns, properties and operators, enabling you to create even more fun rules. I also loved how levels didn't waste screen-space. Everything you see has some part to play in the solution, with no object feeling placed \"just because\". \n\nThe first level of each world serves as an introduction of what's to come. It does a good job showcasing the new elements and the effect they can have on gameplay. But then you start level 2, and the brain goes[i] Unga Bunga[/i] again. This constant feeling of being stumped does have a bright side - numerous [b]\"eureka!\"[/b] moments. \n\nEach world also has a few [b]\"extra\"[/b] levels. They offer a tougher challenge and sometimes have a slightly altered layout from an already cleared level. Logically, you'd assume the solution would be similar to that of the original level. Oh, my sweet summer child, what do you know of logic? \n\n[h3][b][i]Final Thoughts[/i][/b][/h3]\nI've never played a game this complex presented in such a simple and misleading way. Pulling you in with its straightforward tutorial and cute fluffy Baba, just like a Venus flytrap, it strikes when you least expect it. But instead of cutting your life short, it reveals your true, single-digit IQ. In summary, [b][i]Baba[/i][/b] [i]is[/i] [b][i]Buy[/i][/b].\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40407656-Gospel-of-Sv.-Prolivije/][b][i]Gospel of Sv.

The puzzles are hard enough for your brain that the game still feels super hard without being frustrating, and that is what this game excels at.\n\nThe level design itself is also very good. Most sections of the game revolve around a specific mechanic they introduce, and the first puzzle in that section is a level that tutorializes the mechanic while still being a good puzzle. It's the best way of integrating learning the game into it, because you do not need any outside guide for this game at all.\n\nOverall, this game is top notch and got me motivated enough to leave a review for it. 10/10, game of the year so far 100%.

Being in it is like the contemplation of Durer's drawings and prints, with each new viewing revealing to you their sharp, previously invisible faces; hiding small details behind a monumental general idea, requiring maximum attention and immersion from you. The core of the gameplay is as simple as complex - you have a limited area, a few cubes with words that you can move and connect with each other, several things that obey the rules that you will make of cubes. Win it. And this game is all at once. She is programming, she is Sokoban, she is also a destroyer of rules, she is Baba, and all that can be required from an upscale puzzle game.\n\nGet ready for the fact that Baba is your girlfriend or boyfriend with whom you live a very long time, and she knows you. She knows literally everything about you. She knows that you are a self-confident puzzle-breaker and will punish you for it. She knows that after the first victories you will certainly try to apply the successfully derived formula for success in further riddles - and will punish you for that. She will respect you for your growing personal mastery, but will not make any concessions for it. She loves you and hates you, will not let you dictate her own rules, but will allow them to be destroyed, creating something delicious. If I believed in a worldwide conspiracy of pyramid-headed medusians, then I would be sure that this is an experiment on the will of a player who loves puzzles. Each riddle here is like a hymn to the beauty of a pure mind, impeccable elegant logic, the charms of not only the solution itself, but also the ability to change something inside your head in the process of gaining it. This game raises the concept of \"insight\" to some simply inconceivable degree, and it seems to me that it stands here even above the dry rational arrangement of the elements of the puzzle on the shelves. You will feel so many times that you are Archimedes screaming \u201cEureka!\u201d, that just in case you will get a full bath of water and try to discover some new law.\n\nOf course, the creator has invested incredibly much in this game, and this applies to both external and internal efforts. More than 200 puzzles of the highest quality, each of which can be proud of, a magnificent understanding of human psychology, the constant introduction of some kind of novelty into the game, the game does not stand still. Honestly, give this game a workshop for creating levels, and it will live forever, thanks to the crowds of creators who will make new puzzles. This game is ruthless, it breaks with its complexity, but it's worth it, because you always know that even beyond an infinitely complex riddle there is an elegant solution, you just need to change something in your head. If you like puzzles even minimally, then this game should be taken even without any discounts, since its price is very affordable, for its uniqueness it deserves maximum attention.", "timestamp_created": 1579483829, "timestamp_updated": 1579489733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794829666614532471", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118925870": {"recommendationid": "118925870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072298009", "num_games_owned": 4317, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 7777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7777, "last_played": 1658006998}, "language": "english", "review": "Baba is puzzle.\nPuzzle is hard.\nMap has secret.\nMap is puzzle.\nMap has text and baba and flag.\nYou is confused.\nYou is break and recuperate.\nyou is recover.\nyou is resume.\nLevel is win,\nMap is win.\nRock melt water.\nGame melt brain.\nWater is level.\nBaba is surprised.\nLevel is baba.\nLevel is flag.\nGame is challenging.\nGame is great.\nGame is end.\nGame is not end.\nYou is suprised.\nGame is not not end.\nGame is long.\nGame is not not not end.\nAll is Done.\nGame is complete.\nYou is sleep.\n\n\n------------------------------\nWorth the current price (CDN$ 17.49 )?
