Puzzles are clearly conveyed and satisfying with many feeling like actual devices diegetic to the game world than random contraptions a la Myst. Like a resistant microbe or a persistent parasite, Inside is something that sticks around after completion and leaves players asking questions, but it\u2019s a satisfying kind of curiosity rather than a medical emergency.", "timestamp_created": 1677616177, "timestamp_updated": 1677616177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851032733917236328", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137269037": {"recommendationid": "137269037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024767337", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1682279462}, "language": "english", "review": "tf was that ending", "timestamp_created": 1682420216, "timestamp_updated": 1682420216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827698886394500732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143866781": {"recommendationid": "143866781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043081412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1690125114}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Nothing is as it seems.[/h1]\nFrom the makers of LIMBO, INSIDE sees you control a nameless boy in a bid to escape from... something. Having no dialogue, cutscenes, lore or any exposition whatsoever, you are left largely to draw your own conclusions as you progress through the game on the way to your objective.\n\nWhile not as eerie or haunting as LIMBO (which wins out in that category due to the stark use of black/white and no colours), it has a menace all of its own, especially the dogs. The environment also does not feel quite as lethal as the world of LIMBO, but in reality there are still plenty ways to die. There is still a strong puzzle element here, just a lack of obviously deadly obstacles such as buzzsaws, electricity, etc. Instead, these are replaced by sentient beings, such as dogs and humans - some of which are hostile, and some of which are indifferent.\n\nThe game raises philosophical questions about the nature of self, agency, and morality. What does it mean to be human in a society that strips away individuality and autonomy? How far would you go to escape from such a system? What are the ethical implications of manipulating others for your own survival or curiosity? Due to the \"clean\" nature of the game (very limited information input as mentioned earlier), it seems probable that most players will come to their own, unique conclusions based on their experience playing through the game. Then again, it may also raise the question of whether there is even a point in the first place.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for an adventure, story or something more introspective. Much like LIMBO, this is more than a game and comes closer to art or a thought exercise and deserves to be experienced.\n\nPlayed on Windows 11 Pro x64 without any issues.", "timestamp_created": 1691747058, "timestamp_updated": 1691747058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826734304428100586", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141254451": {"recommendationid": "141254451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967865267", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1670605210}, "language": "english", "review": "A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best.

Because while the game is gorgeous, the world building is spectacular (with no dialogue! Show, don't tell), the puzzles are clever, and the escape sequences are so tightly timed that I tensed up [i]every single time[/i], I HAVE to warn you that it's unapologetic in its gruesome story telling.\n\nINSIDE is not a happy story. It's depressing, dark, and twisted, but most importantly: It's terrifically done. INSIDE had my skin crawling like few games dared to try. But that meant going through with the graphic content to back up the stakes.\n\nI'm going to list a one of the death animations and describe it, but under a spoiler tag. That way if you need the extra info to decide, it's there, but I'm not spoiling anything for somebody just scrolling by. But to note: Some of these wouldn't be as bad if you weren't a [i]child[/i] being killed.\n\n[spoiler] When a dog catches you, there's a full death sequence. It bites you, some tear at you, others snap your neck. And you watch for a couple seconds after you die, so it's just dogs eating your body, or your now limp body hanging from the dog's mouth. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] If adults catch you, you get a couple different ones as well. Strangulation seemed to be the most popular, but I was also beaten with a stick/bat once. Again, disturbing to see an adult beat a child like that. [/spoiler]\n\nALL THAT SAID:\n\nIt's [i]incredibly[/i] well made. The world-crafting is terrifically done, as they make every scene you go through count. Watching the people march along, realizing what this factory does to people here, all through phenomenal visual storytelling.\n\nAnd the puzzles fit the world perfectly. INSIDE does what LIMBO did, where you create a gorgeous puzzle game with no UI, except INSIDE did it cleaner. I loved LIMBO, but some of it was tough with it being all black. Through INSIDE, they're able to take full control of color design to make the entire puzzle even better. It's easier to tell what you can interact with and what you can't, the context clues are more fleshed out, and the whole experience flows better for it. Mess up a puzzle and you'll be able to catch what went wrong from your first death. It's great that I only have to mess up once, and the death again gives you clues on what went wrong. I stood somewhere too long, I should've let go sooner, whatever it is.\n\nThe flow of the whole game feels terrific. I didn't realize how jarring it was to go from a desert to the sewers to ice capped mountains, when suddenly I ran into a puzzle game that flowed the whole way through. There were varied environments to work through, giving you a diverse array of puzzles, but it wasn't just abruptly changing scenery all the time. INSIDE's visual design is on a whole separate level in this regard. The enemies that appear, how you dealt with them, and how that progressed the game were [i]beyond[/i] brilliant as well. I'm going to talk about a part from the trailer, so no spoiler tag here: The part where you have to lock-step with other people was AMAZING mid-game. It happens, you have to go through with it, and eventually you make your way out the other side. But I wasn't ready for it, and it felt like such a fun part of the puzzle to do and experience. It's nerve racking, despite being one of the simplest parts of the game!\n\nEvery facet of this game is finely tuned and crafted to make the most of a video game that you can. The dogs barking, the chain link fence jostling, the silence, the loud bangs, all entirely uninterrupted by flimsy stories to justify you changing from the sewers to Paris france even though you were on a mountain. No UI prompts, no minimaps, no score, no timer, no health bar, to bring you that much closer to the piece of art and not the \"video game\" portion of the format.\n\nSincerely recommend, it sets a ridiculous bar for video game story telling as a format. Other games would do well to learn from INSIDE.

The game's art style is simplistic yet incredibly effective, using a dark and moody color palette to create a sense of unease and tension. The attention to detail in the environment is also impressive, with every area of the game feeling meticulously crafted and full of hidden secrets.\n\nThe game's sound design is equally impressive, with an eerie and unsettling soundtrack that perfectly complements the game's visuals and atmosphere. The game also uses sound cues to great effect, helping to guide the player through puzzles and alerting them to potential danger.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive aspect of \"Inside\" is its storytelling. The game tells a captivating and mysterious story without ever relying on exposition or dialogue. Instead, the story is told through the environment and the player's interactions with it, leaving much of the interpretation up to the player.\n\nOverall, \"Inside\" is an outstanding game that successfully combines innovative gameplay, striking visuals, and a captivating story to create an experience that is both thrilling and thought-provoking.

Inside has you control a boy who seems to be running from the dystopian world that surrounds him.  Either the humanoids that he meets on his journey are slumped or under some type of control, sometimes yours, or they are after you knowing that you are not conforming to the rest that are slumped or under control.\n\nInside plays as a simple 2.5D platforming game with puzzles to help you move along the continuous level.  The games lasts about 4 hours, all while dodging enemy humanoid, dogs, and robots.  In order to solve puzzles you can control other enslaved humanoids to help you move heavy items, throw you to hard to reach areas, and more.\n\nThe palette for Inside is rather dark, not as much contrast as Limbo, there original game, but still quite a dark palette nonethless.  The main character is what has the most colors, everything else is a different type of grayish type of color.  This makes for quite a somber atmosphere which fits well in the Orwellian world that you journey through.\n\nThere was nothing difficult in this game that can't be figured out after 2-3 tries in the most difficult of areas, but the unnarrated story of the world you experience mixed with the smooth animated characters movement makes for a satisfying game to play.  The graphics are quite good.  The water effects of your every step, the bending of the boards as you cross over empty spaces, all add to a believable world that you are running around in.  The devs did a good job of the added details in the graphics and animations and really used lighting to its best of effects here.\n\nThe music matches the graphics, simple, somber, and dark while the sounds work well whether driving around in a submarine, or hearing the grunts of control humanoids falling off a high platform.  Overall everything matches well together to create a good sense of immersion.\n\nYou can easily play this game in one playthrough as I did, it is that good and that short.  No matter the length, I enjoy a game that provides all it can give and not stretch it out just by adding fluff, this game was perfectly paces and perfectly designed for levels that would increasingly be difficult, but not so difficult as to stump you.  If you get the chance, check this game out, I'm certain that you can get it for a great price, especially during some great sales.

[19/20\u2b50, 5h\ud83c\udfc5, 2/5\ud83d\udca1]\n\n[b]Context[/b] Inside is an atmospheric puzzle platformer. At first sight, it looks and feels very similar to its spiritual predecessor [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/48000/?snr=1_1056_1055_1056]Limbo[/url] (and any review will necessarily drawn comparisons). But as the game progresses it\u2019s clear that he devs took a considerably different approach. \n\n[b]Writing[/b] The game follows a boy in a post-apocalyptic world trying to break into some kind of facility where biological experiments are performed. The storytelling is purely visual, as was the case with Limbo, but here much more context is provided in the background events, allowing the player to piece together some kind of narrative. There are tons of different interpretations online, but I don\u2019t think the game was designed to have answers to everything, and it is better for it.\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] The game looks and sounds amazing, working together to build an incredibly tense atmosphere. The design is less abstract than Limbo, but still minimalistic and bleak.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] In essence, the mechanics are rather simple, it\u2019s a physics-based platformer, but very smoothly implemented. It is similar to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/48000/?snr=1_1056_1055_1056]Limbo[/url] in that regard, but with less action sequences and precision jumps, which also makes it slightly less challenging. However, these simple mechanics are used in more creative ways and result in some memorable chapters. [spoiler]By mid-game there\u2019s an amazing sequence chapters (the submarine, the horde of zombies, the blast zone).[/spoiler] Finding the secret areas is harder and requires more out-of-the-box solutions.\n\nYou can, and will, die a lot and in varied ways, but you\u2019ll just respawn in a close checkpoint. The game autosaves in each checkpoint. There is no undo but you can restart chapters (although as far as I can tell there are no deadends).\n\n[b]Value[/b] It took me about 5h to complete the game and the achievements [spoiler](including the secret ending)[/spoiler], which is kind of short. There is a single progress slot, but you can revisit previous chapters from the menu. There is an alternative, secret ending. Achievements are related to finding secret areas which involve more challenging puzzles and interesting areas that add to the story. They add up if you revisit chapters, so there is no need for multiple playthroughs.

It is full of tense moments and often plays like a horror title. I can't fault the presentation in any major way. \n\nMechanically, the game is full of relatively simplistic puzzles. Unlike what one might expect, these puzzles don't gradually teach the player things or culminate in a final challenge that calls on the player to demonstrate what they've learned. There's little to say about the game mechanically.\n\nThere's also--and this is the more unfortunate and serious criticism--little to nothing to say about the game thematically. Inside clearly wants to say or suggest something about despotic governments, oppression, the devaluation of life by huge systems and so on, but never actually does. One doesn't even get the catharsis of 'revenge' on their pursuers if that's what one was looking toward. \n\nIt's like if you were to watch a wordless Twilight Zone episode which ultimately had no point at all, nothing to say (something anathema to Rod Sterling). There is a twist, and you can try to intuit what that twist means, but beyond plot curiosities, there is nothing there. You move from inside a system of oppression to, at least in a literal sense, outside of a containment building. \n\nI have to consider this a major criticism because with all this beautiful art and evocative imagery and sound, there is so much opportunity left on the table to actually take the time to try and *say* or even simply *show* anything at all about its subject matter. It's another in a long trend of indie works that thinks that ambiguity is a stand-in for actual courage and intellect in one's art, for the willingness to take a stand on something. \n\nAnd, while ambiguity and mystery can be a powerful force in a work, those works still need to have said something along the way before you leave viewers to ponder, not unlike David Lynch's works. Inside makes no such effort. It never works up to anything, either a big, grand puzzle or a punctuating emotional moment. It settles for the kind of low-effort 'storytelling' that people mistake for depth.\n\nSo while I can recommend it as a walking simulator with light puzzle/horror elements and an intriguing world (which admittedly cribs a lot from Valve's work on Half-Life 2), I can't recommend it as a thematic experience, story, or really anything that might create a lasting impression on someone beyond its largely neutral imagery.", "timestamp_created": 1678743208, "timestamp_updated": 1678743388, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59636688232421875", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134637836": {"recommendationid": "134637836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284513078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1678782621}, "language": "english", "review": "Completely surprised about the ending of this videogame.

If you're looking for your curiosity to be rewarded with a satisfying conclusion, keep looking.\n\nThe puzzles are good, neither too sinister nor too trivial, broken up nicely by tight platforming.

Developed by Playdead, the same minds behind \"Limbo,\" this puzzle platformer exudes a unique and haunting charm that keeps players talking long after the credits roll.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, \"INSIDE\" boasts a distinct art style, shrouded in darkness both in tone and color. The characters are faceless, and the narrative is deliberately enigmatic. This ambiguity sparks conversations and keeps players engaged throughout its three-hour journey.\n\nThe puzzles in \"INSIDE\" aren't mind-bendingly difficult, but that doesn't matter. They strike a balance that keeps players intrigued, eager to uncover the mysteries of the game's world and their character's purpose.\n\nHowever, it's impossible to ignore the discomforting theme running through Playdead's games. \"INSIDE\" continues the trend of portraying a young protagonist enduring brutal deaths, which can be unsettling. This discomfort serves to heighten the emotional impact of the game.\n\n\"INSIDE\" excels at creating a haunting atmosphere. The game raises questions at every turn, immersing players in its eerie world and its enigmatic narrative. The dark and moody visuals, combined with a haunting soundtrack, deliver an atmospheric experience that few games can match.\n\nDespite its simplicity in terms of gameplay mechanics, \"INSIDE\" is a polished masterpiece. With only two buttons for controls, it relies on visual hints and experimentation to guide players, eschewing tutorials and explanations.\n\nVisually, the game is unsettling yet beautiful, with every animation conveying a poetic quality. From stumbling over obstacles to frantic swimming during chases, each movement feels deliberate and adds to the overall experience.\n\nIn summary, \"INSIDE\" is more than a game; it's an experience. While its puzzles may be straightforward, its story is outlandish and confusing in all the right ways. It's the kind of game that begs discussion, leaving players eager to share their \"WTF just happened\" moments. \"INSIDE\" is an unforgettable journey that deserves to be played and talked about.", "timestamp_created": 1693858162, "timestamp_updated": 1693858162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137315041": {"recommendationid": "137315041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199488041376", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1682502187}, "language": "english", "review": "good puzzle game\nvery aesthetic \ni recommend buying it on sale", "timestamp_created": 1682502337, "timestamp_updated": 1682503064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137293786": {"recommendationid": "137293786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230324616", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1682521753}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is cool tho", "timestamp_created": 1682454942, "timestamp_updated": 1682454942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135434409": {"recommendationid": "135434409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062700781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 810, "last_played": 1679787189}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple but interesting game, the puzzles vary a lot, having some that are similar to some of the previous ones but with a different catch or mechanic, making it feel like we are progressing thru the game!

There was not a single point in the game where I had to think about what to do - the biggest challenge is mostly in precise timing, and if you miss the right spot, you die and / or worse, you have to walk (or swim) back - painstakingly slow - and try again. It gets very tedious very soon.\n\nStory is... well, [i]isn't[/i]. Unlike Limbo, where the lack of context didn't matter, here it feels like there actually is a story, but the game does not even do a terrible work of narrating it; it simply doesn't do [i]any[/i] work. In the beginning it looks like a simple \"escape the baddies\" scheme. Then this turns (probably) into some kind of dystopia - so far so good. Then the world starts to seem post-apocalyptic - okay, weird turn, but still somehow manageable. And finally, for some reason, it adds horror into the mix.

You play as a boy who is hunted by government agents. After running through dystopian streets filled with mindless people and empty fields, he would have to cross a mysterious research facility. It does raise the question, is this facility simply on the way, or does he have a greater mission? \n\nStory plays an important part, in fact this game is more story-based and less puzzle-platformer than its predecessor Limbo. The puzzles here feel natural, like how you must use the items around you to progress, instead of being puzzles for the sake of puzzles. For example, in some parts you can gather mindless people to progress. You can lead them and with their help, move heavy objects or reach higher ledges. There's no annoying precision platforming such as \"jump down the slide at the right time to reach next platform and avoid these unnaturally large saws\". And while timing-reliant stuff still exists, the timing is a lot more forgiving.\n\nThe level variation is another good thing, there are many, but they also feel real and natural. There are forests, farms, flooded labs, mines, etc. The enemy encounters, which are my favorite parts of Limbo, are also more common here and are fun to dealt with, like hiding from guards and running from dogs. It reminds me more of Little Nightmares, another great puzzle-platformer with a creepy atmosphere. There are also collectibles, don't forget to seek these mysterious orbs out for achievements and an alternate ending that might make things a bit clearer... even though its still confusing.\n\nOverall, I think Inside is a major improvement from Limbo, which to be honest I don't really like. The most important thing is that its easier and more story-based rather than puzzle-platforming, I never felt frustrated during my whole run. If you enjoy puzzle-platformers and story-based games you will have a great time with this title. Especially recommended if you like Little Nightmares, it might scratch that itch despite the lack of scary enemies and boss battles.", "timestamp_created": 1683718080, "timestamp_updated": 1683718080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137960309": {"recommendationid": "137960309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088817092", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1683473886}, "language": "english", "review": "DAMN.

This game is an absolute masterpiece.First of all, the visuals in this game are stunning. The art style is minimalist but incredibly effective at setting the mood and creating a sense of unease. The animations are so smooth that it's almost like watching a Pixar movie (except with a lot more darkness and existential dread).But the real star of the show here is the gameplay. \"Inside\" is a puzzle platformer that will have you scratching your head and wracking your brain, but in the most enjoyable way possible. Every level is a unique challenge, and you'll find yourself constantly surprised by the clever ways the game forces you to think outside the box.And let's not forget about the story. I won't give anything away, but let's just say that \"Inside\" is one of those rare games that manages to be both incredibly thought-provoking and absolutely bonkers at the same time. It's the kind of game that will stick with you long after you've finished it, and leave you pondering its meaning for days.Overall, I can't recommend \"Inside\" enough.

The platforming is tight, and the overall experience is simply unforgettable. I found myself getting lost in the game's incredible world and didn't want the journey to end.\n\nIn conclusion, INSIDE is a must-play for anyone who appreciates a game with incredible atmosphere, stunning visuals, and an engaging story. While the puzzles may not be the most challenging, the game more than makes up for it with its other strengths. If you're looking for a game that will leave you with a sense of wonder and amazement, then INSIDE is definitely worth checking out!\n\nWritten using ChatGPT cause I was too lazy lol.

Though, I liked that there was less trial and error deaths during Inside. I'm not sure how much harder or easier the hidden collectibles could be, because that's never my focus when playing a game.\n\nI urge anyone that can stand a little creep factor and is not completely averse to puzzles to give this one a try.

A game which serves as a workshop itself for gamers and developers on how to create a complete, unique and distinct adventure.\n\nMy advice would be to not read this review and to just play.\nIf you're interested you can find the first minutes of gameplay to ease up your mind on my channel (where I upload the first minutes of the games I review): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W5UDWw5IGY\n\nIf you want to learn more, I'll explore some aspects below without telling much of the story.\n\n[h3]Oppressed[/h3]\nThis word comes to mind when you start. \nIf you've ever played Little Nightmares, you'll probably find some recognizable patterns in this game's pacing. \nWith that said, Inside manages to bring the atmosphere and sense of stake to the next level, resulting somewhat more original and oppressing.\n\nI can't quite put my finger on it: it may be the desaturated tone, the neverending silence, the masterfully created ambiance. I don't know, but there's a constant sense of danger and discovery which instantly sets you in the right mood.\n\n[h3]Creative Physics[/h3]\nThroughout the game you'll come across different type of puzzles, and even though they're really not that difficult, they surely are creative and make you appreciate the effort. I would say that creativeness has been more of a focus rather than difficulty. In fact, everything runs smoothly and rewards you for thinking simple patterns. \n\nWhat's interesting is how characters' animations and movements were made. Particularly your character, the child. There's a sense of heaviness and naturality to movements when actions are performed, and it allows for a more immersive and \"desperate\" feel to your constant run towards your objective. \n\nThat combined with the use of \"inverted\" water physics made for an unique environmental experience, even though I would've appreciated more of that (even though I prefer to have less quality experiences than more average ones).\n\n[h3]The Sound Of Silence[/h3]\nIt really baffles me that the \"silentness\" of Inside is what makes it great. Sound direction is so on point, well layered, dark and heavy that it makes for half the experience. Just hearing the world around you and the strangeness that comes through it is enough to make you invested. \n\nEven though it may be simple at times, this game's ambiance is unbelievably layered. Some ideas excited me for their originality. Really, really good.\n\nOther than that, you won't hear a single line of dialogue while playing. I'm constantly repeating myself in my reviews, but this subjectively makes for the best experience one could ask for. You've got a world which makes itself believable and interesting without a single explanation. Everything is there and what you see is enough to draw your own conclusions. Inside is just that: there's no menu, no introduction, anything. It's just you, the player, experiencing a slice of time in the bigger picture that is Inside. \n\n[h2]Closing thoughts[/h2]\nInside isn't a long game. In fact, it'll probably take you roughly 3-4 hours to complete (that is if you walk around and explore with a slow pacing). But it is so intense that you won't be bothered by that at all.\n\nI'm kinda sad that Epic will be Playdead's publisher in the future: this game is the perfect example of creative freedom with a powerful message and clearly shows the developers' intentions all the way through. I hope they'll still manage to surprise us. Funny enough, given Inside's overall meaning, it's interesting to see Playdead being funded and aided by Epic. On a further note, though, publishing games by yourself is hard and can lead to uncertainty on the economic side, so it's no wonder they went this route. I'm eager to see their next project.\n\nWith that said, this is an amazing example of what Unity is capable of and, from a developer point of view, the amount of character they managed to squeeze into Inside is really remarkable. Truly one of the best games I've ever played, and it'll be remembered fondly.\n\nPlay this game, you won't regret it.\n\n[i]More reviews[/i]: \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/recommended\n\n[i]YT Channel[/i]: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXMd490dpLAJxONpEpvOMnw", "timestamp_created": 1665054782, "timestamp_updated": 1665054889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137215928": {"recommendationid": "137215928", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073181696", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1682331646}, "language": "english", "review": "7/10 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0439. \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \n1. \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430- \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0443\u044e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043a\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e-\u0442\u043e. \n2. \u043f\u0430\u0437\u043b\u044b \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432 99.9% \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044f\u0445. \n3. \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0432 80% \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e\n4. \u041f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\n\u0423\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0451\u043d, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u044b \u043e\u0431 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435(\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f- \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438+\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\n\u041d\u0430 \u0447\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1682323715, "timestamp_updated": 1682323715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523325026035308838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139305493": {"recommendationid": "139305493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394638604", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1687889503}, "language": "english", "review": "Sometimes I read the negative reviews for a laugh.

check out my reviews to see all the games i have completed!\n\ninside is a puzzle platformer developed and published by playdead, a danish indie developer based in copenhagen. the studio was founded sometime in 2006 to develop limbo, their first game released in july 2010. it was a massive success, not even just for a small indie studio from denmark, but it was considered a massive success on a national scale/level. later in 2010 they started development on a second game named \"project 2\" where they would flesh out all the things the developers liked about limbo and make a new game that wasn't a true sequel. they even got a million dollars in funding from the danish film institute, a agency responsible for supporting and encouraging film and cinema culture, and for conserving these in the national interest. early in development playdead changed engines from a custom built engine to unity after they figured out it would be more efficient and reduce the workload greatly. during e3 2014, playdead announced their second game as a spiritual successor to limbo, with a 'early 2015' release date. after a delay to 'mid-2016' and demo coming in august 2015. a xbox one release came first in late june, while a pc version released in early july, and a PS4 version released in late august. additionally, a release on mobile devices came in december 2017, and a nintendo switch port came in 2018.\n\ngameplay wise, it is a massive improvement over limbo, which was already great when it released in 2010 especially. the main thing that jumps at you right away in the improved art style, but as you dive into the gameplay you'll realize there are intricacies that weren't in the first game, such as collectibles that actually become a huge part of the game's plot/story. i won't delve further than that into the story but it's also a big thing that is great about inside, but in a subtle way that is no doubt biased by me being a completionist and going for 100% on my first run of the game. the deaths, that forced the ESRB to give limbo a teen rating, have been fleshed out even more, which earned inside a mature rating. there are deaths that are a little more graphic, especially with the much-improved art style. \n\nIGN had played a new exclusive demo at e3 2016 and called the game \"super limbo\" and compared limbo & inside to the NES & SNES. i agree with the sentiment for the most part, but i really feel like inside does enough to stand out on it's own and separate itself from any potential shadow cast by limbo. i think limbo is a solid game, but limbo, while being a similar size (i 100%'d both in under seven hours each), just doesn't match up to the great new ways that inside will provide similar gameplay elements. i am extremely excited for a third game from playdead, which was first teased in 2017 and as of late 2023 hasn't even been officially revealed in any capacity. \n\noverall, inside is short, which was also my biggest complaint with limbo. if you haven't played inside or haven't played either of playdead's games, i highly recommend doing so as soon as possible. they're short enough to where you could beat both in a single day if you really wanted to. and going from limbo to inside is a awesome experience and a huge upgrade while being unique enough to stand out on it's own, so it's fun to see the development of the developer. it's a fantastic experience that controls beautifully, making it one of the better games you'll ever play.", "timestamp_created": 1694678747, "timestamp_updated": 1694678747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142938174": {"recommendationid": "142938174", "author": {"steamid": "76561199271422589", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1690527297}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fucked up game.", "timestamp_created": 1690527734, "timestamp_updated": 1690527734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142116156": {"recommendationid": "142116156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324046160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1688938892}, "language": "english", "review": "Short story, but very enjoyable.

While McNuggets are not always good, based on my past experiences with them and my past experiences with Inside, I think that I probably would have had a better time overall with them.

While it has no direct connection to [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url] except that it comes from the same studio, you immediately get the sense that this game is based on [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url]. The fluidity of your character\u00b4s movement, the subte yet beautiful background and the sounds that match the action perfectly - all these staples of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO/][i]LIMBO[/i][/url] are artistically reinvigorated in [i]INSIDE[/i]. \n\nWithout spoiling anything, [i]INSIDE[/i] has a creepy atmosphere that is complemented by simplistic, yet stunning visuals and sounds that give an eerie feeling. Storywise, it leaves almost everything up to interpretation, which I percieve to be a good thing because it doesn\u00b4t spoon feed you. There is no notable dialogue. No tutorial. No help. You\u00b4re thrown into the game without even so much as a main menu. And that\u00b4s great because it\u00b4s unique.\n\nHowever, this game does have some cons, as any indie game does (otherwise it would be mainstream). It is fairly short - at a relaxed pace, I played it through in four hours. For the price of \u20ac11.99 (-40% on sale), thats more money per hour than most other games. Especially when we consider that there is a lack of replayability in this game - once you\u00b4ve played it you know the solutions to the puzzles and can (maybe) come back to it a few months, if not years, later. But if, like me, you don\u00b4t measure games by cost per hour but rather by entertainment value, you\u00b4ll be impressed. That said, I do recommend getting [i]INSIDE[/i] on sale rather than full price, or waiting for the price to drop over time, because \u20ac20 is pretty steep.\n\nAnother negative is the ending. [u]MINOR SPOILER AHEAD[/u] [spoiler]In my opinion, the ending is pretty unsatisfying and leaves a lot of questions unanswered.[/spoiler] It leaves much up to imagination, which could be considered a good thing as I said before, but in the case of the ending it lacks clarity.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Simplistic yet stunning visuals\n[*]Fiiting, creepy sounds\n[*]Atmosphere of uncertainty that inspires player\u00b4s imagination\n[*]Appeals wonderfully to [I]LIMBO[/i] fans\n[*]You aren\u00b4t spoon-fed\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[*]High price per hour (if purchased at \u20ac20 and not on sale)\n[*]Lack of replayability\n[*]Ending - see minor spoiler above\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n[i]INSIDE[/i] is an indie game with beauty and is artistically executed. While it lacks replay incentification or price value (at the current \u20ac20), it doesn\u00b4t spoon-feed you and instead inspires your imagination.

It's not just about puzzles and getting yourself to the next step, if you pay attention to whatever happens around you; the sounds, voices, movements, light affects and the ideas, you will actually know that INSIDE has a very deep meanings.\n\n* I enjoyed INSIDE although it's a short game that took me nearly 5 hours to 100% finish the game along with its achivements, taking into concediration that I normally had to repeat some parts where I died few times before solving the puzzle and moving on.\n\n* For me I got INSIDE on the Summer Sale 2017, and I recommend buying the game on sale.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The coming parts, along with my screenshots includes spoilers !!\n\n[spoiler] SPOILER ALLERT\t[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] After completing the game, you might start wondering about what does all of this mess means. Well it differs from one player to another but for me I think that INSIDE is all about mind manipulating and enslaving poor and weak people. That can go as a general idea, but for the idea that is a little bit more obvious, the main character of INSIDE is this little boy who came from the poor or similarly, the low class of people. somehow this little boy managed to escape and not being captured by the scouters who appears at the beginning of the game. these scouters work for a huge orgnization that targets the low class people of the society as they are considered as worthless creatures regardless their role in the society, capturing them and using them as lab rats under the supervision of the company's or orgnization's scientists. Performing new tests and experiments directly on these enslaved people which will lead into so many mutations and transformations. One experiment after another (The Company) have reached to a point in where they can control the minds of the enslaved ones which will result in controlling their actions. This is the new trade that gains the capitalists huge profits by offering this mind control to the high class people of the world so they can use the enslaved mind controlled people as machines at their service. \t[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Back to the little boy, as I mentioned he managed to escape from being captured by the scouters, and then he tries to find his way out of all of this. But, on the way his concepts changed as he experienced the role of the mind controller. Now, he aims to free out all of the other people who have been captured and been put and used in the experiements of The Company. During this journey some concepts can be noticed as they describe the little boy's thoughts changing such as: the little tiny chicks at the beginning of the game, if you pay attention, after blowing them towards the box none of them dies yet one of them starts to walk slower than others and apperantly seems weaker. The mind whipped bodies that the little boy controls using the mind controling helmet are another example; in the part of the game where you need to gather 19 of them to open the huge metal door, you can realize that the last one of them is a dead body. And the other group of the mind whipped or controlled people who provides help in the elevator, you can actually realize that this group includes individuals that lost an arm, a leg or even a head. All of these details are pointing to one direction: the change of heart and mind of the little boy. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] How? the little boy now knows that working in a group and for the benefit of the majority, a sacrifice is a must. The little chick, the dead one and the lost organs ! as he reaches the big dome that he knows later on that it is actually a big tank, he manages to dive in and be close to a big, sticky, organic blob that is made of organs and people, body parts, legs, arms and even heads ! all in one big strange manipulated formation ! these are the people of his class in this society, could be his friends, or even family ! so he now believes that he must sacrifice him self for the benefit of the majority as he tries to unplug the mind controlling healmets he gets sucked into the blob and then try to lead it to its freedom and its way out of this place. The blob causes chaeos and huge losses inside The Company while on its way out and finally rests on a shore with some sun light away from The Company... The little boy managed to save the currently captured people, but who knows what rich and powerful people can do again !\t[/spoiler]\n\nAt the end thats my opinion, and as I said other people may have different thoughts about all of this.\n\nThe game is amazing and worth buying it.\n\n* 11/25/2017,  nominated for The \u201cDefies Description\u201d Award.", "timestamp_created": 1498631577, "timestamp_updated": 1511601426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 255, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920799791812896729", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27488644": {"recommendationid": "27488644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046210501", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1638448174}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Martin Stig Andersen, the sound designer and composer for Playdead\u2019s Inside wanted a different yet familiar soundscape for the indie platformer.

That it achieves this preoccupation that might at first seem overly ambitious for a 2D(ish) platformer stands as a testament to the talent of Playdead and the clarity of their vision. \n\nI played and loved LIMBO, and went into INSIDE expecting LIMBO 2.0, with updated graphics and a higher budget. At its most basic level it is that, at least for the opening stretch. You're a small boy. The world is hostile to you if it notices your presence. You must move roughly right to reach an undefined goal, solving puzzles to get past each layer. However, INSIDE differs from this formula in a number of key ways. It does away with the gravity element of LIMBO that many people disliked, and switches it for a more visually stunning mechanic involving water, that also feels more thematically relevant. The water itself is also a large addition, and a knowing joke on the developers part-everyone's least favourite part of 2D platformers is universally the water levels, and yet Playdead built water levels into their game in a way that feels vital, beautiful, and kind of terrifying.\n\nSo how does INSIDE open up this conversation on the body? The protagonist being a small boy, his body's limitations are immediately apparent. They are stressed through the way that he must use the environment for his help, in various ways, but most significantly the controlling of other bodies, which gives him strength and numbers, making the puzzles easily possible. But even when the player feels the power of this control, the soundtrack of pitiful noises the bodies make turns it into something extremely uncomfortable. As you navigate through what appears to be some kind of facility, it becomes clear that this place is built around the research of this kind of control. What is not clear is, where do these bodies come from. Are they grown? Were they once people? \n\nThe games final stretch clarifies this theme, although I won't go into it here. I've heard some people express dislike of the ending, but I thought it was fantastic, in the most unsettling and upsetting way. Where LIMBO went straight for your emotions, INSIDE is content to go for your brain and play with it.\n\nAnyway.

It\u2019s very easy to notice the similarities between the two games, and if you\u2019re a fan of LIMBO I believe it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019ll love INSIDE. That being said, INSIDE brings forth many new elements which makes it stand on its own as a unique experience and in my opinion, a masterpiece. \n\n[b] Gameplay\t[/b]\n\nLike its predecessor, in INSIDE you play as a young boy as he navigates his way through a dark and mysterious world. The gameplay itself is a lot of fun, with puzzles that are extremely interesting and varied enough to not ever feel repetitive. Most of the puzzles present themselves fairly clearly, something which I found allowed me to spend less time thinking about what I had to do and more on the feeling of suspense and the actual story. This works well with the game since there is high level of tension throughout much of it, with many parts specifically designed to make it so you just barely escape the clutches of death. This makes for some moments that are very heart pounding and almost theatrical. \n\n[b] Stunning Setting\t[/b]\n\nThe atmosphere is impeccable. Everything about the way in which the game sounds and looks adds to the overall mood. The sounds and music are minimalistic, making it eerily quiet at times with just the perfect effects or music to amplify the moment. The art style is absolutely stunning and manages to add beauty to the otherwise very bleak and ominous setting of the game. Beyond that, INSIDE has some of the best animations that I\u2019ve ever seen in a platformer. There seems to be an animation for every slight movement you could possibly make. This adds an incredible amount of character to the young boy, making him seem so much more real and causing you feel even more personally invested with his well being.\n\n[b] Story\t[/b]\n\nLike LIMBO, INSIDE manages to say so much without saying anything at all. It\u2019s very story rich, but instead of holding your hand and explaining everything it leaves you to put together the pieces as you make your way through the game. The story is fantastic and wonderfully twisted, keeping you wanting to continue onwards to see what happens next. The payoff to this is enormous, as the storyline is perfectly built up to an ending that I found to be very well done. I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about the story, and I think this is the best way to go. The manner in which everything unfolds is captivating and best experienced with a clean slate. \n\nMy one and only complaint about this game is that it\u2019s a bit short, taking me just a few hours to complete as well as go back and earn the achievements I had missed. However, I think this stems from my love of this game and simply being sad to see it end. Setting aside my desire to squeeze even more out of this experience, it really is a perfectly paced game, giving us enough time to fully enjoy it without going on too long and becoming stale. \n\n[b] My Verdict\t[/b]\n\nThe asking price might be a bit too high for some, but I can honestly say that this is not only the game of the year for me but is now one of my favorite indie titles ever, so it was well worth it to me and I\u2019m happy to support games of this caliber. However I realize not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did or want to spend that amount, so if you\u2019re unsure there\u2019s never any harm in waiting until the price has dropped or you can grab it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1469204542, "timestamp_updated": 1551708216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87269216775894165", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42032458": {"recommendationid": "42032458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448546594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 505, "last_played": 1681912323}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect, Perfect Perfect...

Inside? Inside where? How? When?\n\nIf you've played Limbo, you'll know generally what to expect here in terms of gameplay. Running, jumping, and suffering a brutal death when you miscalculate anything. It's smooth, beautifully animated, and controls well with a gamepad. While some sections are challenging, it's more about figuring out how not to get killed than a sheer test of platforming skill. \n\nBut there's so much more to it than that. Every minute of the game will lead you in unexpected directions. It virtually never uses the same idea twice without significant alteration. Some mechanics are even introduced once, then discarded for the rest of the game. And it's loaded with interesting ideas, keeping me excited to explore each new creepy area. \n\nAnd it IS quite creepy. Not in a jumpscare horror sense. But with the unexplained hostility of enemies, and the gloomy, deteriorated backgrounds, there's a sense of something being very wrong with this world. It uses silence and emptiness to incredible effect. The word \"oppressive\" comes to mind. \n\nAlso like Limbo, the plot advances without any dialogue, exposition, or really any indication of what's really going on at all. It's loaded with clues and implications all throughout, but never outright tells you anything. You're left to wonder, right up until an ending I couldn't possibly have predicted.

But as enjoyable as Limbo was to play, Inside is simply better.\n\nThe setting is more interesting - dystopian factories, control rooms, laboratories in the midst of conducting bizarre experiments, ruined buildings, flooded underwater sections, and a handful of outdoor areas, all filled with weird, creepy, and occasionally stunning visuals, creatures, characters, and events. The puzzles hit that sweet spot of requiring contemplation and experimentation, but not requiring a walkthough, and it's thoroughly satisfying to walk into a new area, initially without a clue as to how to proceed, but then with a lever pull here, or a crate move there, have things slowly fall into place (sometimes literally) until suddenly it all makes sense and you can move on. There's a few timing-based puzzles that can get a bit frustrating, but they're nothing more than a minor negative, and are more than balanced out by some truly creative ones. Like Limbo, Inside's world is primarily black and white, but the graphical style is superior, with many areas featuring an incredible visual depth, and detailed, well-populated backgrounds. Your young avatar might be limited to moving in a 2D plane, but Inside's inhabitants are not, and sometimes a character off in the distance who initially seems like nothing more than interesting window dressing will unexpectedly rush forward to pose a significant threat. And the various character animations are excellent, particularly towards the end of the game.\n\nAnd what an ending it is. Inside starts out good, gets REALLY good, and then the last half an hour is simply some of the most enjoyable, memorable gameplay I can recollect. It's all backed by a great story too, but one that's told without a single line of dialogue or written text - everything is left to your interpretation. It's the kind of game you'll find yourself thinking about after finishing, or hunting down fan theories to try to determine what the heck you just experienced. There's a brief alternate ending that can be unlocked as well, and while it's not especially impressive by itself, it certainly will supply some serious fodder to the theorists.\n\nI expected Inside to be a solid puzzle platformer, but it's more than that, and has become one of my favorite games of 2016. If you liked Limbo, if you're a fan of the genre, or simply want to play a good, interesting, different kind of game, I highly recommend it. The only caveat is that for a game that will likely take you about six hours to complete, the current $20 dollar price tag might be off-putting.

Speechless. Wholeheartedly in awe.[/b]\nThat's how I'm feeling after full playtrough.\n\nIt was few years back, when I began depressing journey with [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/]Limbo[/url][/i]. Back then it was for me much more discouraging because of the puzzles, that my brain just couldn't handle; but I was in Love with the tone, visualisation, and playing it - until I reached the end - and to this day, [i]Limbo[/i] is game that I will, with pleasure, recommend till the end of time.\n\nAfter five long years [i][url=http://playdead.com/]Playdead[/url][/i] came up with their second tittle - [i]INSIDE[/i].\nLet me tell you right away - waiting this long was worth it!\n\n[i]INSIDE[/i] is showcase what someones devotion to games, great artistic vision, trust in player base and brilliant mind can come up with, in this crowded gaming world.\nFrom start it wasn't for me possible to look at this game, and be bored, or be disinterested; because with every frame comes new thing to discover.\n\nI was trying to keep away from spoilers, as much as I could. I succeeded. \n[i]You playing as little kid; running from people, beasts; timing your jumps so you wouldn't end as splatter in dark alley, and being careful while swimming in the dark; trying to grasp control over you life, and life of others. You run forward where mystery of this world is hiding, and along the way figure out your purpose in this dark and twisted story.[/i]\nWhat is happening here is disturbing, weird, confusing, and if the ending won't leave you with sense of \"What the F*, just happened!\", I seriously don't know what will. \nThis story works perfectly, and when credits starts to roll, that is the point where your interest will spike even higher, cause you want to know more ... also there is alternative ending, which digs even deeper.\n\nStory (despite how much I enjoyed it) is sidetracked by astonishing visuals and overall aesthetics. \n[i]INSIDE[/i] looks spectacular. \nForeground and background seamlessly coming together at the center where the action lies. Work with lighting and shadow in just incredible, and the level of detail that is made because of this, is just top level. \nEverything on screen is set as indented, just to give us this eerie feeling, sense of hopelessness and misfortune behind every corner.\nWhen you add to this mix great ambience sound, with on point sound design - result should leave you entirely at awe.\n\nControls are smooth, and on point. I didn't experience any issues whatsoever while playing with controller.\n\nMy biggest fear were puzzles. After [i]Limbo[/i], I was really cautious. Why? Let's just say, there were moments I rage quit a lot. Not with [i]INSIDE[/i]. Yes, I admit, there were few instances of me getting annoyed and discouraged, but if it was up to five times I'm already exaggerating. So on this front, I was satisfied with myself that I could get thru, with only smallest possible help of guides (just a couple - I swear to God, I don't believe in). Also it was so satisfying for me, to pat my own back for job well done, when I figured something out (yes, I'm one of those people - dumb). \n\nI won't shy away from statement, that [i]INSIDE[/i] could easily be pinnacle of gaming in my personal experience. \nThis is art that should be celebrated by playing it, and afterwards recommended it to others, so they can too experience this game. I agree; story might not suit everyone (ending is probably even worse in this manner), but from technical stand point and playability this comes to very top. \n\n[b]Thank you[/b] [i]Playdead[/i] for this game, \nand whoever you are reading this, and still didn't play [i]INSIDE[/i] just do it!\n\n[i]Grade:[/i][b] A+[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1488842680, "timestamp_updated": 1488842726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843316853046417236", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24824242": {"recommendationid": "24824242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000537256", "num_games_owned": 11255, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 309, "last_played": 1470842573}, "language": "english", "review": "INSIDE is a sidescrolling platformer made by Playdead, who also made Limbo. The game will feel very familiar if you have played Limbo back in the day. The gameplay mechanics and even to some degree, the atmosphere feels similar. The game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful. \n\n[u][b][h1]Graphics:[/h1][/b][/u]\n\nThe game features one of the best looking visuals I have seen on a sidescoller game. The graphics are somewhat simplistic, the characters don\u2019t even have face features, they all just have a blank face and that\u2019s probably the art-style chosen deliberately by the developers to convey their vision of the game. To add that mood and atmosphere to the game. The game always ran on 60 FPS for me, not a drop at any time. The FPS are locked at 60 FPS.\n\n[u][b][h1]Sound:[/h1][/b][/u]\n\nLike the graphics, the sounds are minimal too but as an aritisic choice. The ambient music, the minimalistic sounds really add to the already creepy atmosphere of the game. In the intense moments of games such as enemies chasing you and closing in on you, heartbeat sounds can be heard which really add to the whole creepy experience of the game.\n\n[u][b][h1]Gameplay:[/h1][/b][/u]\n\nSimilar to Limbo, you just start off in the game and nothing is explained. The story is left up to the users to interpret. INSIDE starts off with you, a boy, dropped off in a forest. You start going forward, only to find out that you\u2019re being hunted and the people in the background are looking for you and upon sighting, you they will chase you down and kill you. They have dogs as well who will relentlessly chew you down when they catch you. These enemies are usually in the background but they can spot you and run towards you to the foreground.\n\nSimilar to Limbo, you have almost exactly the same running patter, you can jump very similarly and can drag objects, open doors and grab onto ledges to pull yourself up etc. That\u2019s the basic movement in this game. There are new puzzle types introduced in this game like the mind controlling of the almost zombie like humans. The puzzles themselves are not hard at all and at most take 2-3 attempts before you figure them out. There are a few longer puzzles too, one for example require you wandering in at least 4 places looking for more zombie mind controllable humans.\n\nThe game\u2019s setting can be really atmospheric. Some segments which are underwater or segments with dogs chasing after you in a short space can make you feel downright claustrophobic. To avoid any spoilers, I will not go in detail about what sort of puzzles there are as most of the puzzles are only used once in the game. So you can expect plenty of different types of puzzles in the game.\n\nThere are forest sections in the game, the inside of different buildings sections, underwater sections, there\u2019s even underground sections. Some sections such as a test lab and other various environments can be found in the game, all of which look beautiful. You also get to play as a different character(s), at the end of the game, I won\u2019t say which to avoid spoilers. The game is said to have 2 endings but I have only seen the one which was quite weird to be honest.\n\nA short gameplay video can be found below, though I\u2019d advice not to watch it if you are planning on buying as it will spoil some part of the game for you.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=741640250\n\n[b][u]Graphics: 10/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Sound: 9/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Gameplay: 9/10[/u][/b]\n[b][u]Overall: 9/10[/u][/b]\n\n[u][b][h1]Conclusion:[/h1][/b][/u]\n\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous to look at and sounds incredible. It\u2019s an experience you most likely won\u2019t forget soon. Simply said, it\u2019s a masterpiece and a must play for people who like atmospheric and tense games. People who enjoyed Limbo will definitely enjoy this game too. The game is pretty short, about 3 hours of gameplay total, so if you think the price is high for that much content you can always wait for a sale and get the game when it\u2019s cheaper.", "timestamp_created": 1470913286, "timestamp_updated": 1470913679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838427245616912842", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24225597": {"recommendationid": "24225597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970644090", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1468135485}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, by far, one of the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had.

You immediately notice the monochromatic approach they decided to continue with here. Colours are not restricted to mainly black and white, though, as in Limbo, however, it is still a dark game.\n\nAgain, similarities with Limbo: the protagonist is a boy who ventures into a dangerous environment. This time it's all about a facility with lots of scientists, weird machinery / equipment and dozens of zombie-like people who appear to be part of a dark project. The game does not have an intro or any text explaining the background - you have to put it together yourself. \n\nControls are once again very simple: we can basically walk around, climb, swim when underwater and grab things to either interact with levers or pull boxes or open up heavy, metallic doors. Occasionally we can put on a helmet - these are the more interesting parts of the game (puzzle-wise) as by using such a device we can control other humanoids. A later section requires the boy to use a small submarine to cross an underwater level.\n\nMusic is minimalistic - emphasis is mainly on the environmental sound. The entire game looks very surreal; something that is a bit Orwellian, very much dystopian. In terms of genre I would consider it sci-fi-horror. Similarly to Limbo the game takes a couple of hours to complete - interestingly, achievements are not related, at all, to game completion but to finding secret orb generators we have to turn off.

With that tool and some professional knowledges aboard you can invent whatever you want and make the world progress faster. You can come up with the best ideas regarding plots and scenarios, you can think out the toughest mysteries and puzzles. The possibilities are countless, or even better say, infinite.\n\nThat was exactly the thought I was thinking about all the time while playing this little masterpiece. Everything what I saw in there blew my mind from the first seconds and couldn't let me go until the final scene. After that, I needed an extra hour to recover, 'cause it was simply terrifying and crazy.    \nMy speech about human's brain wasn't just another random thought, it has a direct connection to this game. The trick is that in this game everything you see and experience - it's all about how you accept it and how you interpret the story. Game is so much full of mystery feel and completely dark and scary atmosphere, telling you the story without a single word, which is incredible and gives you space for the speculation\n\nSame as Limbo (previous developer's game), you play as a little boy and the game starts with a runaway from dogs and guards. From the first moments of game play I realized that I am playing a really quality product. The movement of the character was sooooo smooth and animation was done so damn good, that it really satisfied me a lot while I was playing. I was sure, that the plot will start to open itself in a one hour maximum and I will start to understand what's going on there. Damn, how wrong I was..\n\nI mean, the game doesn't tell you anything directly, you've got to come to it by yourself and that what makes this game a masterpiece. However, you don't have to be supersmart to understand everything what this game tries to tell you, I still saw hundreds of different theories about what the hell was going on in that game. All of them sound like a real thing and have a right on living. That's one of the greatest thing I really admire in nowadays indie games - while trying to position itself as a simple 2d platformer Inside brings you a more complex, mysterious, detailed and terrifying universe, full of riddles and unexplainable stuff. Add to this absolutely polished and perfectly designed every level, genius sound effects and excellent work with colors and you will get the Inside. Every simple detail in this little gem looks like it was created with a full attention and done with love. \n\nTo be honest, it's almost impossible to describe Inside with words. In this case, you need to try it and experience it to not spoil yourself the whole pleasure. Inside has a completely simple controls, so you will not be distracted from enjoying the art, well designed backgrounds and mysterious plot. Also, it's quite a short game, which can be completed in 4 hours at max, but I really recommend you not to rush and simply enjoy it..\n\nOk, let's try to sum everything up! \nYou should grab this game if you:\n\n+ Still never played this masterpiece (such a shame! xD )\n+ Looking for a decent indie game\n+ Dull atmospheric games with a mystic feel is your thing\n+ Have a good taste in games\n+ Like this WTF feeling in the games, where you have a lot of to think about after the game \n+ Fan of games with easy achievements, simply beat it and get every single achievement, that's it\n\nRecommend to avoid if you:\n\n- I noticed a bunch of people were moaning in the negative reviews about the price of the game (~20 USD) for such a small game and content in it! For me it's a complete nonsense, of course, because I believe that in this case you pay for unique experience and terrifying emotions. But if you think that 20 USD is way too much for playing a really good quality product (which is, to be fair, kinda rare thing nowadays) then yeah, that's not for you at all.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[url=store.steampowered.com/curator/32013470/] Follow my curator's page if you enjoy my reviews and want to stay tuned!

This was after playing only a few minutes of gameplay.  \n\nThe graphical style is dark throughout but well-defined and moves along really smoothly.  The animations are truly amazing and the sound effects perfectly complement the graphics style.  It's worth turning up the volume, especially low frequencies!!  Later on in the game they make for an awe inspiring experience.\n\nWhat I really love about INSIDE is the design of the game.  So many \"Puzzle Platformers\" try to increase apparent content by using puzzles requiring repetition or forcing the player to revisit earlier areas.  There is none of that in INSIDE.  The game evolves nicely into unique undefined sections, the gameplay never becomes stale or repetitive.\n\nSome may say the downside of this is a fairly short completion time, it should take around three hours or so.  I'd MUCH prefer to have three+ hours of quality, non-repetitive, intriguing gameplay than rehashed puzzles/zone/etc padding it out into six or seven hours of frustrating boredom!\n\nI've had the game only a few days and nearly completed a second playthrough.  It's such an enjoyable experience to replay, this is the genius of the design.\n\nThe puzzles aren't pitched at a high difficulty level, they're just right to be enjoyable and not to have to resort to searching the interweb for solutions.\n\nThe game never explains itself, I really enjoy this ambiguity.  When the game ended, I felt it was right.  It feels like a work of art, not just due to how it presents itself visually but the emotion it leaves you with at the end.\n\nThis could possibly be my GOTY 2016.

Yes and no. Yes, it deserves high praise and it's truly an incredible game. But no, it isn't the \"second coming of Christ\" of the video game world. It's a game that I enjoyed greatly, but it's not for everyone.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nOkay, let's get this out of the way. Inside is absolutely GORGEOUS. Although one could argue that it's drab/dull, this was intended and it was executed really well in my eyes. When you add the really clever camera angles, you have one of the prettiest games that 2016 has to offer. However, I do have one complaint, and that being that sometimes I had trouble distinguishing things that were important to the puzzle or whatever from random things in the background. It got annoying in some cases, but luckily it doesn't take much away from the overall experience.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nAn interesting bit to Inside is that it doesn't use one gimmick throughout the game, for example Undertale's mercy option and Superhot's \"time only moving when you move\" mechanic. Instead, Inside has different ways to solve puzzles, and once you think you know all of the tricks to puzzles, something new is thrown your way. It may seem annoying, but it actually worked really well here. Everything felt fresh and interesting, not to mention that the controls are very tight. It all adds up for a great time in the gameplay department.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWhile most aspects to the game are very high quality, this and the audio are probably the best things to Inside. The story to Inside is fascinating and will keep you interested from start to finish, while also keeping you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to say much about it, however, because Inside is a game you need to experience yourself.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nAs I said, this and the story are the two best things to Inside. The music fits very well when it plays, but where the audio truly shines is the sound effects and ambience. It makes everything so much more thrilling and creepy, and I love it. I think it's a fair argument that Inside has some of the best use of sound in a video game to date, because it's one of the reasons why I love the game.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\n\nUnfortunately, this is where Inside isn't so strong. There isn't much replayability to be had aside from a few \"things\" that are best left to be discovered for yourself, but the game itself lasts about 3-4 hours for a normal run, But that being said, the impact this game could have you could be significant and it might be embedded in your memory for quite a while. This game is definitely capable of such a thing.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nAs I said, Inside is an incredible game that you should experience, but note that it isn't the second coming of Christ, nor will it appeal to everyone. That being said, if this game even at least remotely interests you, then I say go and buy it. You won't regret it.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - 9/10\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - 9/10\n[b]Story[/b] - 10/10\n[b]Audio[/b] - 10/10\n[b]Replayability[/b] - 4/10\n\n[b].:9.0/10:.[/b]\n[b]\"Amazing\"[/b]\n\n+Outstanding use of audio and atmosphere\n+Gorgeous graphics\n+Thrilling story from start to finish\n+Constantly adds new gameplay elements\n+Great camerawork\n\n-Can be hard to distinguish items from one another\n-Lacks replayability", "timestamp_created": 1468032244, "timestamp_updated": 1517670370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790737032890319824", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28427566": {"recommendationid": "28427566", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981776655", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1481988700}, "language": "english", "review": "Inside is amazing.

When you think of \"games as art\" this is definitely one that should be on the list: the change between cramped claustrophobic quarters to expansive rooms, the simple art style that can convey so much information, the fluidity of movement of every character, and most importantly the way it can tell such a deep story with such basic elements.\n\nA very deep, very confusing story. Seriously, even if I wanted to write a spoiler review there is no way I could do that. This game is\u2026 it\u2019s messed up.\n\nYou play a nameless faceless boy running through the forest, hiding behind stumps while trying to avoid a search party out looking for him. It\u2019s shocking from jump because there are a bunch of dudes, armed with rifles that fire tranq darts and hey real bullets because why not, and attack dogs. Clearly something is up with this kid. The weird part is, that he\u2019s not trying to get away \u2013 he\u2019s trying to break INSIDE this facility. Get it? I think that\u2019s the point right? But really WHO KNOWS BECAUSE GAH WHAT JUST HAPPENED??\n\nImmediately you are pushed into this expansive complex after breaking through their walls, barbed wire, and attack pigs. Yeah you heard me. This is not the weirdest thing you are going to experience, so just hold the hell on.\n\nInside the buildings you run into more guards, more dogs, weird creatures, mind control, telepathy, submarines, and\u2026 let\u2019s just say that they clearly consulted David Cronenberg for certain levels. I mean\u2026 Jesus.\n\nThis is a horror game in the sense of the movies Se7en and Misery. The fear is from the story, from the environment, from the ambience that the whole thing provides. The suspense is not knowing what the hell is coming next, but also not being able to stop playing. There are no jump scares, no slavering beats\u2026 the fear is simply the unknown. The grey washed out color scheme, but featuring a little kid in a red shirt. The faceless adults going about their business, lining people up and loading them into cages.\n\nThe light, as it grows dim the deeper you dive into the murky waters, until there is simply nothing left but your faint silhouette.\n\nUltimately the game conveys the story of a boy who is completely, inextricably alone but is pushed further and further into this weird\u2026 Aperture Science type place.\n\nRating: Stayed up 2 out 5 five hours past bed time. One of those lying awake in the dark, staring at the ceiling, filled with creeping existential dread.\n\nGo play this right now.\n\nFull review and more at basedgamer.com/@Morlock", "timestamp_created": 1480009541, "timestamp_updated": 1480009541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785437226295471191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24287322": {"recommendationid": "24287322", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998696138", "num_games_owned": 837, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1468373428}, "language": "english", "review": "A very well done, but very short 2d puzzle platformer.

When you go to play I recommend to you emerge completely in the game. Sit back comfortably, turn off the lights and put on good headphones. That makes all the difference. My congratulations to all who made the audio because without it the game wouldn't be the same. You play paying close attention to the sounds, they make you apprehensive and when you notice, the beat at the background of the sound is actually your heart. Fans of LIMBO will not be disappointed. The graphics are great, the puzzles are engaging, you sleep thinking about the game. I particularly LOVED this game, it is in the atmosphere style that I enjoy and I really like the games that don't need much to impress and make you recommend. Simple in gameplay, in controls, but I felt it to be somewhat philosophical and critical, not just a puzzle. You love and hate some things in him. I've already been impressed by being a child who goes through things that you think \"is just a child\" and \"WHAT?\". I'm a student of game design so yes, I noticed everything you did, every detail. Wet, dry, movements (that by the way looks great!), the backgrounds, sonoplasty, among other things that I don't want to give spoiler for who read. I finished the game and thought \"Oh, was too short ... I wish played more ...\". Reflecting about this I can affirm that the time is perfect. Unless this would be too short and more than that would be too long for the kind of game. It really impresses me when a game of simple appearance shows us to be much more and makes success with it. Another peculiarity is that it isn't realistic in graphics, but there are events that reminds you that the character is human, hasn't power, has human conditions, is mortal. And why a face?? If you actually counts what happens INSIDE. So in this aspect he became very realistic. And this only proves that games can be very good without having to be as realistic as possible in the graphics, without looking like a movie. Congratulations for the game, I recommend it!\n\n---------------------------\n\nN\u00e3o sou de fazer review mas esse eu tenho que comentar.\n\u00c9 realmente bom. Quando for jogar recomendo emergir completamente no game. Sente-se confortavelmente, apague as luzes e coloque bons fones. Isso faz toda a diferen\u00e7a. Meus parab\u00e9ns \u00e0 quem bolou todo o \u00e1udio, por que sem isso o jogo n\u00e3o seria o mesmo. Voc\u00ea joga prestando muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o aos sons, eles te deixam apreenssivo e quando voc\u00ea nota, a batida no fundo do som na verdade \u00e9 seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o. F\u00e3s de LIMBO n\u00e3o v\u00e3o se decepcionar. Os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o \u00f3timos, os puzzles s\u00e3o envolventes, voc\u00ea dorme pensando no jogo. Eu particularmente AMEI esse jogo, \u00e9 no estilo de atmosfera que eu curto e super aprecio os jogos que n\u00e3o precisam de muito para impressionar e te fazer recomendar. Simples na jogabilidade, nos controles, mas senti que \u00e9 um tanto filos\u00f3fico e cr\u00edtico, n\u00e3o apenas um puzzle. Voc\u00ea ama e odeia certas coisas nele. J\u00e1 comecei me impressionando por ser uma crian\u00e7a que passa por coisas que voc\u00ea pensa \"\u00e9 s\u00f3 uma crian\u00e7a\" e \"O QUE?\". Sou estudante de design de games ent\u00e3o sim, eu notei tudo o que voc\u00eas fizeram, cada detalhe. Molhado, seco, movimentos (que a prop\u00f3sito ficaram \u00f3timos!), os backgrounds, sonoplastia, entre outras coisas que n\u00e3o quero dar spoiler para quem ler. Terminei o jogo e pensei \"poxa foi muito curto... queria ter jogado mais...\". Refletindo sobre isso posso afirmar que o tempo \u00e9 perfeito. Menos que isso seria muito curto e mais do que isso seria muito longo para o tipo de jogo. Realmente me impressiona quando um jogo de apar\u00eancia simples nos mostra ser bem mais e faz sucesso com isso. Outra peculiaridade \u00e9 que ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 realista nos gr\u00e1ficos, mas tem acontecimentos que te faz lembrar que o personagem \u00e9 humano, n\u00e3o tem um poder, tem condi\u00e7\u00f5es humanas, \u00e9 mortal. E para qu\u00ea um rosto? Se na realidade conta o que acontece INSIDE (dentro). Ent\u00e3o nesse aspecto ele cumpriu muito com o \"realista\". E isso s\u00f3 prova que os jogos podem sim ser muito bons sem ter que ser o mais realista poss\u00edvel nos gr\u00e1ficos, sem parecer um filme.

The story is pretty dark so for those who prefer darker games with a message and meaning this is a perfect choice.\n\nYou play as a boy similarly to Limbo and traverse through levels in side scrolling manner. I personally prefer this game to Limbo just because Inside feels more of a narrative game rather than puzzle/platforming game. Puzzles are much easier and levels have more variety so for those like me who prefer to put story in the first place it's definitely a better game.\n\nThere are puzzles of course and some of them may be quite challenging but nothing like Limbo where at some points game became frustrating.\nPlatforming sections are easier too so both puzzles and platforming do not distract you from the story and doesn't break the flow of the gameplay.

Limbo came out way, WAY back in 2010; back when nighttime television audiences were torn between Team Coco and Team Jayjay, iPads roamed wild and free, and vuvuzelas were declared auditory torture devices. Other stuff happened too, but I've been very successful in repressing Glee and I don't want those memories rushing back now.\n\nOh, and Limbo came out to critical acclaim and commercial success during Xbox Live's Summer of Arcade. It was a 2D puzzle-platformer where you navigated, well, \u201climbo\u201d in a minimalistic, film noir looking world. Simple, intuitive controls, breathtaking visuals, and an eerie ambient soundtrack made Limbo a darling in the video game world to critics and gamers alike.\n\nSix years later (almost to the day, spooky!), the very same devs have released INSIDE, a... 2D puzzle-platformer.\n\nOh.\n\nBut like Frictional Games has shown, sometimes it works to stick to (and improve on) what you know. Playdead has improved on Limbo's simple formula in every conceivable way resulting in something I didn't think was possible: a better Limbo, and six years later to boot... that's like improving the wheel far as I'm concerned. \n\nINSIDE is the really messed up, feature length Pixar movie you control and didn't know you wanted but you definitely do \u2013 and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nINSIDE has you playing as Red Shirt (Christened thusly by me because of his distinct red shirt and his propensity for dying a lot), a little boy hanging out on the wrong side of an Orwellian industrial \u201chas-science-gone-too-far\u201d allegory. You traverse the bleak, twisted world, solving a wide variety of logic and physics puzzles much like Limbo before it (pull this crate, climb this rope, press this button, etc.). Unlike Limbo, however, the most memorable moment isn't blown in the first 20 minutes of the title... no, this one left my mouth gaping in awe beginning, middle, and end. It never stopped surprising me.\n\nThe story is far more successful than Limbo's minimalist tale; Playdead delivers the story in much the same way but it's far more sinister and compelling this time around. \"Hunted and alone, Red Shirt finds himself drawn into the center of a dark project.\" That's all Playdead gives you, and that's all you need. The environment and denizens of this Aperture Science Gone Extra Combustible Lemon Wrong happily fills in the rest.\n\nIn the three hours it took me to complete INSIDE I never felt the dark whimsy dissipate... the creep crept, and the weird waited, and the bizarre beckoned. Every time I thought, \u201cno, things can't get more strange, more DIRE than THAT,\u201d Playdead indisputably proved me wrong. In the three hours it took me to complete INSIDE I never felt the puzzles get samey... Playdead introduced a new mechanism, a new horror, a new scenario that would require some reevaluation. But I never felt stuck or frustrated as it all made sense in the confines of INSIDE's world, and I maintained a pretty steady clip from start to finish.\n\nIn short, buy INSIDE if you love Limbo; buy INSIDE if you love atmospheric puzzlers; buy INSIDE if you love video games: it's an instant classic. The controls are tight, simple, and intuitive, the atmosphere is incredible, the story is excellent, and the puzzles are inspired. Everything about this game is stellar, and it's not one to be missed. \n\nINSIDE is easily a contender for Indie GOTY.\n\n... \n\nShit, I remembered Glee happened.", "timestamp_created": 1467910257, "timestamp_updated": 1467920786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 394, "votes_funny": 139, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764375507831573486", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24265486": {"recommendationid": "24265486", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964449222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1472286099}, "language": "english", "review": "What I would give to be able to experience this for the first time again.", "timestamp_created": 1468287472, "timestamp_updated": 1468287472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76211249828338623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30935647": {"recommendationid": "30935647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035780493", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1488363886}, "language": "english", "review": "A lonely and terrifying journey that will disturb you to the core.

I\u2019m not a fan of puzzle-platform games with trial and error gameplay but this one is quite forgiving and easy, making room for lesser frustration. Briefly, INSIDE\u2019s strongest points are its linearity, simple controls and delightfully spooky atmosphere as well as the creativeness of the puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay is more focused on puzzle-solving than survival so instead of introducing \u201dsh*t your pants\u201d type of scares, you\u2019ll be immersed into a creepy, atmospheric world with artistic graphics and ideas that will chill you to the bone. That is to say, there is still a bit of sneaking and escaping, and you must have an understanding of the perfect timing to make a successful getaway, otherwise you\u2019ll end up like mushed potatoes. \n\nAlso, the way the game\u2019s narrative conveys itself without words is mind-blowing.

Taking control of a nameless boy caught in a dark hostile world that is out to kill him. Sounds like Limbo does it not? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nLike its predecessor Limbo, Inside is a straight forward 2D puzzle platformer with seamlessly incorporated environmental traps and challenges. They flow perfectly into the game that is free of any immersion breaking cut scenes.\n\nFrom simpler traversal of objects to controlling a a little water sub-marine and more complicated control of machinery. They never interrupt the narrative or feel forced into the game, a welcomed evolution from its older brother, Limbo. \n\nInside has more colour, offering a more realistic approach than Limbo but the game remains dark, giving the entire thing a bleak look. The brighter back drops stand out and contrast with a world mostly overcast by decay and destruction. Abandoned buildings, dark forests, deep, murky waters. There\u2019s beauty in this visual style.\n\nIn a similar fashion, the audio is unique in style. Harrowing, flashes of music underscoring the distinct sounds of gushing rain, loud machinery, or running footsteps or the crushing of bones and flesh...\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nSimilar to Limbo there is something more to the troubles of traversing the puzzles in the boys path. The narrative is minimal, only via environmental details. \n\nThe protagonist is apparently on the run but the world and its inhabitants are unforgiving and take no mercy on the fragile little boy, dropped all alone into a hostile place. A society has enslaved people and is using them against their will- as you go deeper inside you will find something distrubing and surreal. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Uncompromising atmosphere\n[*]Cleverly incorporated puzzles\n[*]Puzzles are diverse, not repetitive or frustrating\n[*]Flawless, clean 2.5D visuals\n[*]Top notch sound and music\n[*]Achievement / collectibles as an extra reward [/list]\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*]Game length, to whom it matters; Inside can be finished in 5 hrs if you're in a hurry\n[*](Much less of a problem than Limbo) A few unforgiving trial and error puzzles\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nInside improves upon every aspect of Limbo.

You play as an unnamed, faceless character probably best just called \u201cBoy,\u201d who is on the run in some sort of weird dystopian industrial hellscape where he\u2019s pursued by men with hunting dogs. The goal is to avoid death or capture, and though there isn\u2019t a \u201cstory\u201d per se, you will be introduced to an exceedingly bizarre world full of monsters both friendly and hostile.\n\nFor me Inside stands out because it's platforming gameplay make use of the basics and lets just say it makes use of them amazingly. It\u2019s pretty simple, really. You run and you jump, you pull levers and open doors, you push crates and swing on chains. Sometimes, the game introduces specific mechanics, like where you have uh, \u201callies\u201d that assist you with certain tasks, and there\u2019s even a vehicle segment. But there\u2019s no overriding gimmick, nor does your character level up or gain new abilities.\n\nThe puzzles are difficult enough to be interesting, but simple enough not to be frustrating. Some of my favorite segments included the use of \u201callies\u201d to complete tasks, and I also really enjoyed outsmarting enemies that are out to kill you.\n\nThe game\u2019s core appeal is probably not in its mechanics, but its art style and atmosphere, which creates haunting, sprawling areas which bring life to this strange but wonderful world. You, as \u201cBoy,\u201d will meet some violent ends, however. I was ripped apart by dogs, strangled by guards, blown into pieces by sonic blasts and shredded by underwater fans to the point where I could see my 2D intestines streaming out of my body. So in short, watch out.\n\nThe ending sequence is one of the most wonderfully bizarre things I\u2019ve ever seen in a game, and to say any more would be a crime, as it\u2019s just something you have to experience for yourself.\n\nThe game is very short. I beat it in just under four hours but I probably could have done it in less time had a few puzzles not tripped me up for extended periods of time. And while I like the sense of mystery that surrounds the world of the game, I would have liked a few more clues as to what on earth was going on in this world, but the game offers you exactly nothing which adds to the overally mystery of the game. I suppose that\u2019s its own sort of fun and part of the concept\u2019s appeal.\n\nSo to conclude Inside is an incredible game, a compelling artistic achievement that deserves your time no matter what genre of game you would normally play or prefer. I wish there was a little bit more to it, but between the gameplay, the animation and the atmosphere, it\u2019s enough to be a worthwhile experience.

If not, then you are in for one of the most atmospheric games ever made.\n\nThe game starts with a boy dropping down into what it seems like a forest. As you slowly make your way across the forest, the first thing you notice is your footsteps. There is no music, no dialog; all you hear is your footsteps echoing across your path. This drives home one of the most important themes of the game; isolation. You start with an avalanche of questions; you get some answers along your path, but more pop up. This is a dystopian world, which is open to self-interpretation with no guided narrative. I have a feeling this is intentionally designed. The boy, just like the player, has no idea what is going on. This helps the player to connect with the boy and in-turn, get a more authentic feeling of the world around them. Inside focuses all its attention to this level of environmental storytelling and it works ever so well. Where most games put you on the shoes of a capable super soldier of some kind. Being a lonely boy in a dystopian world such as this makes you feel more vulnerable and careful with every move you make. \n\nYou will be doing a good mix of platforming and puzzle solving. The controls are not designed to be precise but are more wobbly; this makes perfect sense in relation to the player-controlled protagonist. The platforming therefore do not ask more from the player than it is possible with the controls. Puzzles do not seem to be designed to challenge players and more importantly, beyond the capabilities of the boy, but injected as another core storytelling delivery. Being so fragile in such a hostile world, regular deaths is pretty much guaranteed. Observant players however can avoid many of these deaths, as the game drops down hints leading up to a kill-zone.  \n\nI love horror games in general. Where most horror games tend to use superficial themes; such as zombies, ghosts, aliens, etc. Playdead games tend to stick to more realistic and peculiar tones, which players can better connect. The game ends up peaking our curiosity while raising our heart beat at the same time. This is something what I like to call Genuine Horror which is, at least to me, is the most effective flavor of horror. \n\nThe game is a big upgrade over the silhouette-style of their previous game, Limbo. The visuals no longer follow the style of its forebear, but go for a more realistic but still stylistic tone. The sound played a huge role in Limb, and continues to do for Inside. The sound production and design is incredible to the point it is hard to believe it is an indie game. Animation beautifully meshes them together. It goes for double duty by amplifying the narrative further by making the boy feel more like a boy than just a small protagonist with all the nuances you would expect from a kid. \n\nThere used to be a time where videogames used to surprise me. They were an emotional rollercoaster ride. However as I grew up, these things became clich\u00e9s and forgot those feelings I had when playing a game. Inside is one of the very few games after so many years, which managed to wake up those dormant experiences. \n\nInside is not a long game and I am glad the studio did not stretch it out and sacrifice the pacing as a result. Had I played this game last year, it would have been my game of the year. \n\n10/10 - I can't think of any flaw in this game", "timestamp_created": 1500305127, "timestamp_updated": 1500306501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734845161437988281", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74001532": {"recommendationid": "74001532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289502638", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 256, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1595081720}, "language": "english", "review": "[code]Curator page here-->[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37670120/] DaRevieweD #35[/url]<-- [i]New review every Sunday[/i][/code]\n\nDanish independent developer Playdead made quite the entrance with the premiere of \"Limbo\" in 2010. That was about a boy's journey in between the living and dead. As if that wasn't already engrossing, Playdead came up with the spiritual successor \"INSIDE\" half a decade later with a more ambiguous title! \n\nI played the demo on console before and woah I didn't understand it- that's a given as I knew there had to be underlying messages hidden way in there! I also reviewed the former when I was still writing much shorter, clustered reviews back then- so I regard this as a way to show how far both Playdead and well me, have progressed! Lets get right to it~  \n\n\n[h1]\"Breach The Surface\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nA boy abruptly emerges from the woods. Where is he running from or maybe even heading towards? Along the way he runs into a desolate wastelands, other people being held captive and an organization that also wants to apprehend him. Before he realizes it, he's found himself within a string of experimentation and it seems there's no going back.\n\n[spoiler] ! C-conspiracy? Could it just be that?[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) On The Run[/b]\nIf you've played Limbo, you'll feel right at home. It's a 2D platformer with a huge emphasis on puzzle solving in order to figure out how to get around obstacles. More cooler neat animations were added, that are delightful to look at! For instance, if the boy steps on the edge of an object, ledge or suddenly decides to quick turn after building momentum. And boy is he quite the swimmer, being able to dive and swim skillfully although he could use some more practice when it comes to holding his breath. \n\nThere are also actions that he'll do by instinct and these are prominently displayed during stealth segments like crouching down, palm of his hand against the wall surface. You can tell a lot of work went into his movements alone and I really appreciate that!! Controlling him (poor choice of words) is always a treat~ \n\n\n[b](b) Classified[/b] \nThough the puzzles were not as migraine-inducing as Limbo, they were still unique and do not seem randomly thrown in. What I mean by this is they fit the cold and controlled environments that they were most likely actual assets and were at one point made specifically for scientific research. This boy is now repurposing these gadgets to his advantage. They may start off like your typical \"drag crate to climb over something\" but that quickly evolves into more ingeniously designed, could have been made by the Riddler- that I also had some trouble with (not as much as Limbo where I rage quit for months). \n\nThere are also secret contraptions just menacingly stationed about, whose functions are not known but they're shaped awfully familiar.. Anyways, the chances of you stumbling into them are quite rare unless you're super observant and take advantage of the \"E\" key every chance you get. But the hints are in the achievements themselves (thankfully not hidden ones) and you can always effortlessly reload a checkpoint should you miss one. Then skip ahead back~ These are optional but they do lead to a strictly, mind-screwing alternate ending of sorts. Just let that set in.\n\n\n[b](c) Fractured[/b] \nThe story is probably 90% why you're even touching this game! It's THAT good!! As for the storytelling however, it could use some work. It's another silent protagonist and there are no conversations (not with words). What we do end up with is a very mysterious sci-fi plot and a utterly hostile world, devoid of hope. What follows next is merely my interpretation of what the title could mean and the whole point of the story; so chill and feel free to skip~ \n\n[spoiler]Now, meaning no.1 the boy (who's dressed in red) is actually a spy sent INTO to break out some...thing. That explains why he knows where to go and is kinda competent. Hence, the organization guarding the complex is aware of this and is constantly on the lookout. No.2 is related to the mind control aspect- to literally get INSIDE someone's head which is a big part of the puzzles. OR finally, it's about secrets and how \"to get on the inside track\" of something. There's an extraterrestrial being that could save the dying planet and so experiments are being performed on it. But they didn't anticipate interference from the boy who may or may not be controlled.[/spoiler]There's probably more outrageous or plausible (your call) angles to approach this. Mindblown!!\n\n\n[b](d) Out of Bounds[/b] \nNow I'll breakdown what made this game scary! The many creative deaths and variety in animations of said dying aside, the horror is much subtler. One, notice the setting- a place that's abandoned caused perhaps by a fatal disease, the infamous global warming or[spoiler]alien invasion[/spoiler]. Heck maybe it's man-made, idk cuz what's presented are the after effects but not the before. Either way, we could have potentially been staring at our future and we didn't realize it, at worst didn't care *gulp*. \n\nThen there's the obligatory paranoid thought of a top-secretive research facility in the heart of the woods somewhere, away from civilization. Is it run by the government, are they doing it for the sake of mankind or towards an exploitative and personal gain? But with revelations of a [spoiler]device overriding free will, taming of a creature of sorts[/spoiler], it would point towards the latter and fitting of human nature. Finally, I couldn't help but shake the notion of a little bit of Marxist ideals in there. For one thing, it takes place in a work environment and then some of the workforce appear mindless to do the bidding of some higher power. Followed by the inevitable revolution of the oppressed. One last thought, I may be overreacting but where are all the children!!? \n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) Does The Top Stop?[/b] \nI'll just say it- I didn't like the ending. Woah, that felt so liberating to get off my chest. In all seriousness it wasn't actually THAT bad, just let down. It probably requires a lot of thought but patience has never been my strong suit.[Spoiler]There are two endings; canon and alternate, or maybe they're reversed, IDK!![/spoiler]. The fact that it ends on a cliffhanger- a happy-ish note, whatever. \n\nBut then you start to overthink it. Even something as simple as, who's good and evil for example??! You realize for example [spoiler]the final scene is similar to a certain staging area behind glass. Coincidence?[/spoiler]. This game is perhaps too rich for me to analyze and I despise it for that but it did nothing wrong (maybe that's what it wants of me). I didn't encounter any bugs and you heard how the story went. I know what I must do about the score.. but first.\n\n\n[h1]\"Deeper Than Ever\"[/h1]\n\nTo recap, INSIDE may retain the core characteristics of what made Limbo a worldwide sensation; from the moderate graphics to potentially challenging platformer puzzles. However most apparent is the magnetic, mysterious plot to put that curiosity leash around you but it is a far cry from there on out. The story is even more interestingly convoluted and the title can bear many meanings. Whereas the ending of its predecessor could be hinted at, Inside leaves you hanging with uncertainty as you never really guess what the game will throw at you next.\n\nPiled with the shock from progressively horrific happenings that unfold and a truly oppressive post-apocalyptic world, you cannot help but think of the worst! Perhaps most terrifying is the fact that we'll never (not definitively) get an answer as to what it actually meant- to peer into the developers' minds. You're still most welcome to try and you know there'a little part within you that will be dying to~ \n\n[h1]9.8/10[/h1]\n\n[b]From the afterlife to a dystopian world- where will Playdead take us next?

Go ahead and buy the game.\n\nIt's a weired experience, I can't explain. But it's rewarding! After finishing the game, I don't even have clue what this game's all about. Far more than Limbo, this game tells you nothing why these stuffs happen, which has lead to various theories online.\n\nAnd one which I prefer is this:\n\n[[\nI believe the purpose of the game is to explore the relationship between game developers, players, and the avatars that said players control. Think about it: Who is in control of the game while it plays? You would think the Player is in control, since they're the one guiding the boy. But in fact, it is the developers who are controlling the Players by manipulating where they can go; setting the rules and laying out the physics of the game. The entire world of the game is one giant obstacle course planned out to the last detail - this becomes apparent at the end of the game once we see the diorama that shows the last frame of the narrative. This is a hint to the Player that they are in fact, being controlled even as they control the Boy. The scenes of dystopia, especially the scene where the Boy is forced to jump in unison with the other drones, serve to emphasize the Players lack of control and the paradox that,even though the player might seem all-powerful, they're still being guided and controlled by a higher power. (The Devs). The \"special ending\" reveals the way to escape the Developer's Control - by pulling out the cord that supplies the Boy with power. Unfortunately, this also ends the game. Likewise, in the regular ending, once the Blob comes to rest at the bottom of the hill, the Player loses control over it, and this of course, happens right before the ending. \n\nThis makes you think: how much control do you have over your real life? How much of what you go through - the beliefs you hold, the job you work - has been constructed by others in an attempt to manipulate you into doing their bidding? Who are the \"Game Devs\" of Real Life? It seems like a silly question, but then you watch Documentaries like Adam Curtis' \"Century of the Self\" and realize that governments and corporations have (since the 20th century,)  put a great deal of resources into researching ways to manipulate the public. How we vote, what we buy, what we learn in school, all of these are guided by the massive amount of Social Engineering that has been directed at the average citizen. \n\n Maybe this game was a warning to us to pay attention. That to be free, we must \"unplug ourselves\" even if it means we are cast out of the system that currently seems to encompass our existence.\n]] (copy pasted this from Reddit, sorry I didn't note down it's original author.", "timestamp_created": 1538581842, "timestamp_updated": 1593974015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734466493129730225", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58434619": {"recommendationid": "58434619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451375373", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1574953969}, "language": "english", "review": "Inside is a 2D side-scroller game (but the level design is 3D) where you solve various puzzles to progress to the next setting. As simple as it sounds, the charm of this game is in its atmosphere, artstyle and the overall presentation.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe controls are simple. You can move, jump and grab. The level design is 3D but you are confined to move in 2D directions. Very masterfully, the game uses only these to create a fun and memorable experience. Most of the game consist of various puzzles which you require to solve to progress further in the game. The puzzles are average with a few requiring out of the box thinking. (Now, puzzle difficulty is a very subjective topic and everyone can have different opinions on it.)  Remember that you may die a lot in some of these puzzle. Many of these are based on dying and learning from your mistakes.\nThere are many sequences in the game which require you to perform certain acts with amazing timing and the stress and thrill experienced in those sequences is where the game shines.\n\nSTORY:\nOne thing about Inside is that there is no hand holding. When you first start the game, you are given no instructions. It's all up to you to figure out. The story in this game is also similar. Without any dialogues and only through the various settings you come across in this game, the game tries to tell a very deep story. The story is intentionally open-ended, leaving to the player to interpret the story in their own ways. After completing the game, Inside stays with you for some more time as you try to comprehend whatever you experienced while playing it. One may need to play through the game more than once to observe and understand what is actually going on in the game world (it really helps to play more than once to try to fit everything in the story). I will not give any story spoilers but I would like to inform you (so that you don't miss it), this game also has an alternate ending (find it on your own). I would urge you to go through both endings as the alternate ending plays a major part in shaping the story of the game.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThis game really looks good. Each setting is beautifully designed and the color palette used gives the game a certain mood. I overall don't have any complains in this regard. (Do note that you shouldn't expect realistic graphics. This game has a certain artistic style which makes it what it is)\n\nOverall, I would like to RECOMMEND this game to anyone looking for great side scroller puzzle solving experience. Yes, this game is an experience. \n\nNOTE: This note is for ones who have played Limbo made by the same devs. Be informed that this game is not Limbo 2. There is a great amount of similarity between both these games but there are certain important differences which make both these unique titles. The setting in Limbo was like... 'limbo' while Inside has far more earthly setting. Same goes for the plot. Limbo had better devices to kill you in my opinion. I found Inside a bit easier than Limbo but one shouldn't forget that with Inside, they are trying to tell a far more complex story than Limbo.

It took me some time to trust the developer again and try INSIDE - Glad I did.\n\nThere is no cutscene, no introduction, not a single word presented in the game, but it gets the meaning straightforward using graphics and music. A horizon-scroll horror game, where you control a boy solving well-made puzzles, always running forward and into the unknown. Can't say I'm a horror game lover but I enjoyed the early and recent RE games, Outlast franchise and so is this one, as long as there's no jump scares nor disturbing gore it's alright.\n\nThe puzzles are well-balanced both in difficulty and in quantity, keeps me interested all the time, and the way of presenting is impactful, things give me an immersive feeling. The favorite goes to the part where you mimic mindless people walking forward, jumping and facing the right rhythm and direction to fool anyone to believe that you are one of them, then escape. It's smart as well as creepy. INSIDE is not always about survival, you also gotta appreciate the arts like the bodies floating in water like kites in the sky, or in that anti-gravity place where everything is upside down. It's interesting to look at the world from a different angle and INSIDE showed me.\n\nThe last part of the game was unexpecting, I liked the idea of making the protagonist into [spoiler]what people feared and seeing everyone scared and fled[/spoiler], brilliant the game also asked the player to go from right to left after the change, in chaos I panicked and picked whatever path that was open. There's no boss fight nor difficulties I can't pass - a bit challenging for the water witch, the walkthrough feels smooth, creative, and gives insights.\n\nWould love to see more games like this one.\n\n[u] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WelcomeWhyNotGames] My curator page[/url][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1697190499, "timestamp_updated": 1697190499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697629094123840332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "152588536": {"recommendationid": "152588536", "author": {"steamid": "76561199564095369", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1702237005}, "language": "english", "review": "Poor boy", "timestamp_created": 1701360179, "timestamp_updated": 1701360179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677419364452362061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "157026942": {"recommendationid": "157026942", "author": {"steamid": "76561199227630335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1706428872}, "language": "english", "review": "Another masterpiece from Playdead. \n\nInside is a more polished and refined version of LIMBO with its slighty 3D camera angle, more detailed enviroment(obviously, because it isn't a 2D shadow like LIMBO) and smooth gameplays( as always) but this time you need 6 keys instead of 5 with LIMBO.

I found the puzzles to be much more accessible than LIMBO\u2019s. There were still a few that had me thinking, \u201cwhy would I ever think to do that?\u201d, like when you jump out of a barn window into a cart of dead pigs. Aside from the couple of times this occurs throughout the game, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to die 10 times per puzzle to understand what they were wanting. The puzzles are still engaging, just not infuriating.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game drew me in. The visual storytelling that occurs in the background really sets the mood as you try and understand why these people are after you, what did these people do, and what are they doing now? It\u2019s jarring to see faceless masked people watch streams of mind-controlled humans slowly walk by. In one scene to see adults, children, and even a newborn wearing a white mask covering their faces. It\u2019s creepy and adds to the world.\n\nAs to the \u201cstory\u201d, it\u2019s up to interpretation and the ending leaves with more questions than answers. As for my interpretation, I felt that at certain points in the story you are being controlled by one of two entities, the scientists, or the experiment. The sirens unplugged you from the \u201cMatrix\u201d only to have you under something else\u2019s control.

It is a bit of a puzzle game, but puzzles are bit different to what we usually have in adventure games or classical puzzle games (like Myst, Uru ect). Inside also looks like a standard side-scrolling game. We move from left to right. Puzzles dont require running around and spending time on stupid traveling - most of the solutions can be found on the very same screen we are at. Sometimes it is a matter of moving few screens around, which is actually very good. I never enjoyed spending most of the time in adventure games just walking between points. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy - once you learn how simplified mechanics works in this game, you just know what to use, and how to use. Most difficult puzzles require bit more thinking, but again: if you understand how game works, you will solve them relatively quickly. Funny thing is that while puzzles are not very hard, or even very easy at times, they are not stupid. They all seem to be a proper element of the world we see.\n\nGame is very short - it can be easily finished within some 5 hours, plus some more time to deal with achievements (I guess these are most difficult part of the game). While 5 hours dont sound as a lot of fun it is really okay. This game is bit more than just a side-scroller or puzzle game. It really has this something inside. It is grim, dark, sad game, even bit emotional at times. Those 5 horus were pretty much okay for me - I enjoyed them fully and loved the game.\n\nOne more thing - game doesnt communicate with us. We get no introduction, no story is told. We start just like that... and we also end just like that. Everything is just shown to us, but in most cases it is our imagination that has to build a full picture.

The heartbeat in your headphones which mimics your own. The pulsating, deafening shock-waves of an unseen force [/i]\n\nAfter just playing through INSIDE last night in one sitting, the one thing I can\u2019t get out of my head is the sound design. From the little chicks and the unsettling sound of marching to the [spoiler] snoring and breathing of the slaves in and out of the huddle. [/spoiler] Paired with some of the most visually striking and vast imagery, INSIDE grabs you by the head and pulls you down and down into it\u2019s cold, grim world, leaving you on such a bittersweet, yet momentous finale, as well as a bunch of questions and interpretations that are personal to you.\n\nSo many people have their own answers and theories and I applaud PLAYDEAD for creating a game that is so ambiguous and open ended, despite how linear the actual gameplay is. So many feelings and ideas are communicated to the player without a single bit of text or dialogue, yet everyone's conclusion and experience is different\u2026\n\nSpoilers (conclusion below):\n[spoiler]From the chicks to the dead bodies and limbless slaves, the theme of control and sacrifice is abundant. All of these people have gone through all of this suffering and death, yet they still are there to help you progress, whether they want to or not. The horrors in the depths and the floating slaves are initially scary and a threat, yet they are still there to help you, to free you, until finally to free the huddle, this horrific, deformed tortured group of people, you have to join them and become one. \n\nNo one can go through this hell alone. The world is a cold, unforgiving mess, but together, no matter how hard it gets, no matter how many sacrifices you make, you will get through it. There will always be someone to help you. Someone to make sacrifices for you. \n\nThere are hints that perhaps the entire game is an experiment or the boy is being controlled (the secret ending explores this). The hill you roll down at the end has a diorama in the lab. The forest at the start might just be a part of the lab and the whole thing was a test. Throughout the entirety of INSIDE, you are pulled to the right, towards the huddle, until finally, as you become one with it (was it controlling you the whole time) you head left instead, finally \u201cfree\u201d.\n\nWas the ending real? Was the huddle free? It doesn\u2019t matter. For that moment in time, they are free. You are free. And there is peace. As the sun lights up these tortured souls, they can finally have some peace\u2026 [/spoiler]\n\nINSIDE is an experience I can\u2019t take my mind away from, and I doubt I ever will.
