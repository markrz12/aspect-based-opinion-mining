Then it feels a lot like Portal. And therein lies the problem. Because the beginning of this game has some of the weirdest, trippiest, operating-on-dream-logic charm of anything I've ever played. The solutions to puzzles often make no logical sense, yet in another, more emotional way, they make perfect sense. Everything just somehow feels right. It was always very satisfying when I figured something out, even if I didn't quite know why something worked. Especially when I didn't. Then I found the portal gun.\n\nOkay, it's not a gun that shoots portals, but it looks similar to the eponymous device, which makes comparisons between these two puzzles games kind of inevitable. The gameplay mechanics are actually very different and unique. The real issue is that the mechanics feel so... mechanical. Everything in the game becomes very logical and rational from the moment you pick up the gun. It's a stark contrast to how flowing and natural and other-worldly everything feels in the first half of the game. The sense of child-like wonder disappears and is replaced by something that just feels a lot more mundane. I eventually grew bored with the later game and re-started it to experience the first half again.\n\nSo, should you try it? Yes. You should. You won't forget it.

This weekend I finally felt like getting a bit non-euclidean. It's got some great puzzles for sure, and if you gel with the mechanics and the Escher style puzzles then I think this game will be right up your alley.\n\nHaving now finished the game, I think it has a few too many rough edges for me to recommend it. On multiple occasions, some of the puzzle mechanics like lasers would not activate on the first try, or some gun functions would seemingly break without reason. Given the ever-changing nature of the game's mechanics, this often lead me to believe I hadn't done the puzzle in the proper way, or wonder if it was the game glitching out.\n\nGoing forward, I'll intentionally be a bit vague just in case anyone reading this would still like to see the game for themselves:\n\nOn many of the puzzles, especially after getting the yellow matter gun, they can be easily cheesed. It would be understandable if there was a clear and intended order to complete the puzzles, that way the first time you run into that puzzle it's easy to design around the tools at your disposal. However, it happens even during end-game puzzles when the devs thoroughly know what mechanics you have access to. \n\nThere are just so many ways to abuse the matter gun mechanics to bypass the puzzles entirely. This isn't even done in a difficult or obscure fashion either, it's done by using the tools with their intended functions in a puzzle that didn't account for it. This really took me out of the whole thing. Often, the puzzles do not respect your time, making you do repetitive tasks or crossing through the same areas multiple times. For some later puzzles, I'd see the intended method to solve a puzzle, then opt to cheese it to save myself time and repetitive effort. As a player, being incentivized to skip the main point of the game isn't a great feeling. \n\nApart from that, many of the puzzles of the game are more about first impression trickery rather than logic. That's not to say it's bad, and on a first playthrough it's pretty novel to have your mind blown seeing the world bend and morph around you. But with the backtracking nature of the game, having to redo these segments to progress to new areas is once again a time sink, and with nothing new introduced to keep it fresh.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting game with interesting mechanics, but I can't recommend a game with this many rough edges for the current asking price of $20.

This game was another title that came out on the wake of Portal's release as another game within the \"test chamber\" subgenre with a small distinction of having more focus on exploration, something I would perhaps compare to the more modern The Witness. Non-euclidean logic that will blow your mind and test your comprehension skills and critical thinking, packed in a minimalist game which is as efficient as it can be in order to communicate the game's concept and ideas. Everything in the game is intended and serves a unique purpose, even the \"main hub\" and the way \"saves\" work. Uniquely original puzzles that many would consider mind-benders will prove to be a puzzle game fan's dream, or nightmare. I'm glad Steam does not have achievements for this game as this would've ruined the sense of exploration and discovery that this game has. This is a 10/10 and a game I can see myself coming back to.\n\nOn a technical side... this game does not count with Steam Cloud so you'll have to copy and paste the saves yourself. The game won't be saved if you force quit either, please read how to save in the main hub instruction so you don't lose your progress. The minimalist graphics and great use of silence (both visual and auditory) make the presentation of this game pretty timeless unlike a lot of its contemporaries. It can literally run in 10 year old college laptops, hell, it can even run in old mid 2000s office desktops and it would still run great with an appropriate selection of available resolutions.\n\nIf you're a fan of puzzle games, especially First Person Exploratory Puzzle games and/or \"Test Chamber\" Puzzle games then you owe it to yourself to play this game.

Its just a nice feeling to get that aha moment in a game.

[15/20\u2b50, 10h\ud83c\udfc5, 2/5\ud83d\udca1]\n\n[b]Context[/b] Antichamber is one of the \u201ctest chamber\u201d puzzle platform games that came out in the wake of Portal, taking place in an abstract setting (think, for instance, of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/239430/]Q.U.B.E.[/url] before the Director\u2019s Cut). Although the main puzzles rely on simple mechanics, the twist is handling the impossible physics that permeate the levels.\n\n[b]Writing[/b] There is no plot, and we never gets to know what we are doing, nor why. When you solve a puzzle, a \u201clife advice\u201d aphorism is provided that relates to the strategy required to beat the level.\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] Visuals are simple and abstract, without any kind of detail, as typical in these \u201ctest chamber\u201d games. [spoiler]The rigidity of the design is evident by the ending when we finally see something that are not straight lines.[/spoiler] Again, this is similar to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/macwh/recommended/239430/]Q.U.B.E.]Q.U.B.E.[/url]. The ambient style soundtrack is pretty good, although it\u2019s often not clear how the tense/relaxed tones of the tracks relate to the actual game. There is no voice acting.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] For all the emphasis on the mind-bending aspects of the world, the actual puzzle mechanics were rather straightforward. They mostly involve manipulating cubes using guns with increasingly complex powers [spoiler](from creation, to movement, to multiplication)[/spoiler]. The impossible physics were mostly relevant for exploring and navigating between the levels [spoiler](including paths leading back to themselves, or paths that change depending on the perspective)[/spoiler]. Continuing the comparison with Q.U.B.E., the puzzle-solving mechanics feel similar, but the exploration part is much less action-oriented. The game is not particularly hard despite the impossible physics, since the interactions possible interactions with the word are limited.\n\nThere\u2019s a main hub that allows quick travelling to the levels, and also identifies unsolved levels and missed paths (but not missed messages), which also made the game considerably easier. Some of these levels require carrying something from other levels, and due to the way the (impossible) way the levels are connected, this often requires starting from other levels. \n\nOne aspect of the game that was a bit frustrating is some kind of secret puzzle (involving the pink cubes) that has no purpose and seems to have been left unfinished (or was this the intended effect?).\n\nYou can hit deadends, and you\u2019ll just have to return to the hub and re-start the puzzle. There are no deaths or gameovers [spoiler](the count-down timer is there just to mess with the player).[/spoiler]. The overall progress is saved but not of each level, which resets when you return to the hub.\t\n\n[b]Value[/b] It took me 10h to completely beat the game (i.e., solve all levels and get all messages), amounting to about 60 puzzles. Honestly, the price tag seems a bit steep for a game of this depth and age. There is a single progress slot, but you can always revisit previous chapters. You can tackle the levels in non-linear fashion, but there is a single ending. There are no achievements other than the in-game registry of found messages. If you missed some, you can just revisit the levels looking for them. I can see this being replayed only to revisit the puzzles.\n\n[quote][i]For more puzzle-game reviews and curated lists check out the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43326007-The-Clueless-Adventurer-Puzzle-Trove/]Puzzle Trove[/url].[/i][/quote]\n", "timestamp_created": 1693215054, "timestamp_updated": 1693215054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142800493": {"recommendationid": "142800493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020361477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1435526171}, "language": "english", "review": "Very trippy and puzzley.

But while Portal deals mostly in learning the rules of its mechanics and then adding complexity to those mechanics, Antichamber is a game which aims to subvert your expectations about how a puzzle should fundamentally work.  It makes you question the unspoken rules that video games abide by.  Frequently, it is simply brilliant and mind blowing, though occasionally it\u2019s too obscure or random for its own good (especially in later parts of the game).\n\nThere\u2019s no real story to speak of in Antichamber, but the entire experience is expertly accented in a very sterile atmosphere and minimal graphics.  Sound design is also minimal, but well done.  Certain audio cues can give you hints to where you are in the world, and the simple tick-tock of a clock can become a fixture of an entire portion of the game.  It\u2019s definitely a polished game which looks and feels nice.\n\nOf course, the real meat of Antichamber is the puzzles, and it\u2019s hard to say much about them without revealing part of what makes this game special.  Suffice it to say that it is one of the most unique and creative games that I have ever played.  Environments are frequently non-Euclidean in nature, and rely heavily on perspective or understanding the rules of the universe which Antichamber itself has defined.\n\nThere is inherent difficulty in designing that kind of puzzle; if you don\u2019t abide necessarily by the rules of physics or perspective that we\u2019ve come to rely on, puzzles can have arbitrarily hard solutions.  For the most part, especially in early parts of the game, Antichamber does an excellent job of staying consistent and teaching you the ways of its mind-melting world.  \n\nBut in the later hours, you are bound to run into situations where a puzzle solution will feel almost entirely arbitrary.  Frustration will set in, and occasionally solutions don\u2019t have the satisfying payoff they were designed for. There was one instance where I resorted to some online hints because, it turns out, I had completed an earlier puzzle in a non-traditional way and didn\u2019t have the resources the game expected me to have.  It took quite a bit of digging before finally understanding how I was [i]supposed[/i] to complete the prior puzzle so I could complete the current one. \n\nOne very smart addition to curb some of this difficulty is the ability to, at any point, press escape and jump out to the central hub of the world.  From there, you can see your progress and also a map of the entire area you have so-far discovered.  You can jump in to any area you\u2019ve previously visited, and I found it helpful to jump from puzzle to puzzle I didn\u2019t know how to solve.  Typically inspiration would strike somewhere, and my frustrations would yield relatively quickly.  \n\nOverall, Antichamber is a smart, mostly incredible puzzle game.  Moments of frustration are almost inevitable here, and for the most part the balance is hit just right so that frustration results in joyous satisfaction when you make progress. It occasionally missteps and frustration just leads to greater frustration, but it\u2019s easy to forgive when so much of the game is so good.

When I first played Antichamber I didn\u2019t like it.  The visuals put me off, not because I wanted better visuals but because I had this dumb notion that if the graphics were not good then how could I trust that the puzzles were watertight?  Once I finally overcame this utter stupidity, I was ready to play Antichamber.  Not all puzzle games need to be visually awesome like Talos, Witness and Portal.  I honestly don\u2019t know what I was thinking.  Maybe I was high\u2026..but I couldn\u2019t have been high because when I started getting into Antichamber I felt like I was REALLY high\u2026.like call me an ambulance, my brain is turning into jelly, high.\n\nDon\u2019t be like me.  Please, if you like amazing puzzle games, play Antichamber for more than 3 hours.  You have to cross that threshold.  Let getting the blue gun be like \u201csomewhere outside Barstow on the edge of the desert,\u201d and then you can really dive deep into the rabbit hole.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n[list]+  incredibly complex, yet simple.  Yes you will be baffled at the start.  Don\u2019t worry.  That\u2019s the point.  Antichamber wants you to take everything you think you know about puzzle games, maps, geometry, physics and even life itself and take a step to the left into the 5th dimension.  Up is down, down is strawberry jam and backwards is yes.  Antichamber will not allow you to take full control until the very end and will do its utmost to marinade your brain for as long as possible.  But at the right time you will be Neo in The Matrix and you will laugh at how all these puzzles confused you at first.[/list]\n\n[list]+  experimentation.  So if I pull a cube on the x-y axis I can move it into position to open a door!  Awesome!  Wait\u2026.this is just a crazy idea but what would happen if I pulled it along the z-axis?  Would that even work?  The only way to advance in Antichamber is to be creative, think outside the box and don\u2019t be limited by your own imagination.  You will find yourself up against impossible odds\u2026..and quite frankly they are impossible by definition because they defy the laws of physics, so thinking about them rationally just won\u2019t do.  You need to figure out your own lifehacks to this bizarre dimension.[/list]\n\n[list]+  wait\u2026.are those electrons\u2026.pigeons?  The sounds in Antichamber are fantastic.  The music is great and is so subtle as to not take you out of the game or to give you a false hope you are gaining traction in a certain area.  The whole soundboard and soundtrack is sublime.  Mad flashing electrons flutter around like pigeons in a coop, you will fall through huge holes to crashing thunder and land in a puddle of water despite everything being white walls and floors with almost no frills attached.[/list]\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n[list]-  difficulty curve.  While most puzzlers start small and scaffold you up, Antichamber, well, does the anti of that and starts big and then the game gets easier over time.  This was incredibly frustrating for me because I didn\u2019t know if what I was trying was even correct and I didn\u2019t know if I could trust the programming or puzzles of the game.  Were there glitches and bugs?  Was the puzzle logical?  I can say now looking back that yes, the game is solid but I see a ton of friends who own this game who never made it past the 90 minute mark.  Either they farmed it for cards or they just gave up.  And I totally understand that.[/list]\n\n[list]- am I doing this right? There are no cheevos for Antichamber.  So I think I did all the extra stuff?  But I\u2019m not sure.  This game is very much like The Witness in that the rewards for completing the hard tasks is the knowledge that you completed them but even in The Witness there are 2 cheevos.  One for completing the game and then one for COMPLETING THE GAME.[/list]   \n\n[h1] THE CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nAntichamber is an incredible game.  The poor developer Alexander Bruce was the only developer and he got so burnt out by the game it looks like he has given it all up and is now a regular software engineer for a tech company.  Even if this is the only game he ever makes it will stand as a testament to how insane you can push the limits of something and people will still manage to unravel your madness and not only will they solve it\u2026..they will enjoy it.\n\nI am so happy I pushed through Antichamber.  Don\u2019t be like 90 minute Antichamber me.  Challenge your mind and defeat String Theory.\n", "timestamp_created": 1602011682, "timestamp_updated": 1602011682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.91254734992980957", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7754059": {"recommendationid": "7754059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000695200", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1476418023}, "language": "english", "review": "Antichamber is by far one of the best games I have ever played.

Antichamber is an indie puzzle game developed by Alexander Bruce [i](\u201cDemruth\u201d)[/i], Antichamber was released 2013 and is an excellent puzzle game that you should get right now.\n\n\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\n[b]Story:[/b] To my understanding there really isn't a \u201cstory\u201d, not in the literal sense. You start the game working your way through puzzle after puzzle trying to get to the exit. There is a strong sense of progression and rewards for completing various puzzles, so in a way that's the story driving you... completing the puzzles and getting to the end. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The controls are very straightforward, and the game explains how to play as you play... Unless you miss one of the hints like I did once I got the yellow gun. I had to wander around the game for hours before returning to the original place I picked up the gun and noticed the tutorial tip.\nAs you progress through the game you obtain a gun, then upgrade that gun to get a different unique ability that will help you solve new puzzles and sometimes make the old puzzles easier. Just like any good puzzle game, each puzzle is tougher then the last, and often times dynamically different.\nThis is probably one of the hardest puzzle games I've ever played, Antichamber forces you to think about puzzle games in a whole different way [i](\u201cTo think outside the box\u201d)[/i], and after you've gotten used to thinking a certain way for one puzzle the next requires you to think of a solution a different way.\nThere were a number of times playing Antichamber I thought \u201cYeah! I broke that puzzle with my creative solution\u201d only to find out that the game actually [u]EXPECTED[/u] me to figure that solution out the way I did. Expect twisted solutions, creative planning, strategic thinking, and down right mind screwing.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b] At the time that I'm writing this review, there aren't any achievements [i][u](07/23/15)[/u][/i] but they could easily be added later with a patch. The game already has many goals and hidden pathways that you can find. Including added difficulty if you're trying to beat the game in a short time.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Antichamber is priced at $19.99, as most people who have consistently read my reviews knows, I like to spend an hour playing a game for every dollar.\nSo far I've spent 6.3 hours in the game, but it has a high replay value because puzzle games are always easy to come back to play, even after beating them. [i](I forget solutions to the puzzles and go through the whole process again!)[/i]\nAll in all, this game is definitely worth it to me, because I've enjoyed the challenges and the puzzles I've figured out on my own. [i](Just saying, I haven't looked up any solutions, if I got stuck I would go to another puzzle in the game!)[/i]\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] To quickly recap: [i]Story[/i], Not applicable. [i]Gameplay[/i], excellent, challenging, exciting, confusing, winning. [i]Achievements[/i], Not Applicable at this time. [i]Price[/i], fair, better if you purchase it when on sale.\nI recommend this game to people who enjoy puzzle games (especially difficult puzzle games) For those of you who have played Portal... think of some of the most twisted... crazy... test chambers you might play on Portal? This game is like that, almost the whole time. It's awesome.\nI think this game deserves a play, and even if you're not fond of puzzle games, the developers are indie so they could definitely use the support!\nAs always, thanks for reading my review.", "timestamp_created": 1437698268, "timestamp_updated": 1437698268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.859777927398681641", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9306048": {"recommendationid": "9306048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035771100", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1524008098}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to play this game.\n\nIt is not a game, but you have to play it.\n\nIt is not that fun, but you have to play it anyway.\n\n\nThis game is hard to explain.

An abstract puzzle game, it exists in a world built upon its own rules, requiring you to shed conventional logic and adopt an out of the box mindset to progress through the labyrinthine chamber you find yourself in. Up is down, going backwards moves you forward, and nothing can be taken at face value. It's one of the smartest games I've ever played; thoughtfully evolving at every step, as my feeble brain scrambled to keep up.\n\nTo attempt and describe Antichamber would be counterproductive, and a rather hopeless task. The foundation of the experience is designed around self discovery and interpretation, making any outside explanation of how to solve the absurdly clever puzzles and navigate the twisting level layouts detrimental to someone playing the game for the first time. At its core, Antichamber involves manipulating the rules of its world to allow you to overcome seemingly impossible tasks and continue onward toward the next puzzle. More often than not this involves interacting with blocks placed throughout, by way of a gun whose functions extend far beyond the simple ability to move and delete.\n\nThough outwardly simplistic and plain, Antichamber's art direction (and to a lesser extent its sound design) is as purposely and meticulously designed as its puzzles; with clean lines and intelligent use of color all playing a large role in telegraphing integral aspects of the puzzles. Its basic graphical design also accounts for a huge portion of how atmospheric Antichamber can be. Often times I'd find myself so drawn into the experience that I'd look up to find to my surprise I'd been engross in it for hours, as time becomes rather meaningless once you begin to make your way through the chamber. It feels like being inside an abstract painting, with as much artistry and inverted syllogism as you would expect.\n\nThe moments when you manage to solve a puzzle and move forward in Antichamber is one of the most satisfying feelings I've ever had in a puzzle game, which is why it's unfortunate that its intelligence can at times become a handicap; blocking the player from continuing onward and giving little knowledge of how to do so or where they might should head in instances where its functionally impossible to progress without collecting an upgrade first. This is a deliberate aspect of Antichamber's design and a large factor in why solving its conundrums is so empowering, but it has the unshakable counter effect of turning people away on the basis that the game is simply too smart for them (especially early on). It's a shame because once you begin to understand the way the world works the game really opens up and you can finally appreciate it in all its glory, but to get there you'll inevitably be hitting your head against the wall quite a bit as you try and make sense of it all.\n\nAntichamber is a rather intimidating game even to those with a mind for puzzles and an ease at thinking irrationally, but its one that's worth forcing yourself through the first few confounding hours for the brilliant moments of understanding that follow. The ingenuity of Alexander Bruce's abstruse creation is mindboggling (which I mean quite literally), and an incredible accomplishment that I honestly cannot believe came together without falling apart under the weight of its own ambition. I still only barely understand it, but even my limited intelligence can appreciate how remarkable Antichamber is; making me feel clever even as I can fell it silently mocking me for being the comparative imbecile I am.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/07/27/antichamber-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1406491742, "timestamp_updated": 1426468259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.852929115295410156", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "7755671": {"recommendationid": "7755671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065535057", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1590944801}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like games that screw with your head?

Antichamber takes this idea and throws it out the window. Nothing that you see in-game necessarily [i]needs[/i] to exist at any time after you have seen it once. Essentially, you can look at a door and perceive it as being closed, but if you turn around and look back to where the closed door previously was, instead of the door being open, it simply no longer exists. Events of this nature are abundant, and make up a fair amount of the puzzle-solving in this game.\n\nAnother idea Antichamber fiddles with is object manipulation. Various puzzles involve taking a given number cubes and attempting to place them in a certain format in order to generate more cubes, fill a space, block a door, close off a laser, etc. It's very rewarding when you do end up solving a puzzle that had stumped you for several minutes. There are a lot of optional areas where solving a puzzle is not entirely necessary, but can be seen as an extra challenge for those who want one.\n\nVisually, the game is simplistic, and colors are used to signal areas of importance rather than to provide a boost in graphical quality. However, the environment is very bright, and can be difficult to look at for longer periods of time. Keep this in mind when you're purchasing the game.\n\nOverall, Antichamber is a fantastic puzzle game given purposefully minimalistic graphics in order to put more focus on the psychedelic roller coaster of confusion and awe you'll likely be experiencing while playing. You'll have to fight through your own ideas of what defines the space around you, and define it in the game's terms.

It's an extremely tight puzzle that respects the player. The whole game is a trick box, and not a single polygon of it is wasted. There's no filler, nothing is arbitrary. The laconic presentation reinforces the feeling: you're here for the puzzles, and every single one of them is worth it.\n\nEvery. Single. One.\n\nUnlike the vast majority of puzzle games, [i]Antichamber[/i] does everything to avoid self-repetition. There are no 'series' or 'types' of puzzles, no 'stages' here; sure, some principles and tricks repeat themselves, but most puzzles are unique. A [i]Talos Principle[/i]-like \"you get less keys than doors\" puzzle? One. Jumping pads? Seen twice. Unlocking a door by breaking a chain of cubes into several pieces in a labyrinth? Seen twice \u2014 before you find a mathematically unsolvable one.\n\nIt's not unsolvable, of course. It just tricks you into thinking you've found another puzzle in a series, while in truth the principle behind it is different this time.\n\nThis is what [i]Antichamber[/i] excels at, and this is what makes it brilliant: most puzzles in the game \u2014 and there are quite a lot \u2014 have very simple solutions and demand lateral thinking rather than counting or sleuth of hand. Found a ladder? Actually, you need to go through a wall. A jumping platform facing a ledge? Actually, you need to jump in another direction [i]through[/i] a ladder. A floor-less room?\n\nHave you tried using the hint hanging above you as a physical object?\n\nThere are some unlocks that make progress possible and add new rules, but very few of them. Most of the game's variety hinges on the insane inventiveness of the puzzles, redirecting attention, and toying with the player. As a result, every single rooms becomes a unique challenge \u2014 and solving each of them feels [i]great.[/i]\n\nThe closest comparison I can make is [i]The Witness[/i] \u2014 clearly taking a lesson or two from [i]Antichamber's[/i] book. It's another puzzle game that also emphasizes wholeness, unexpected solutions, and where nothing is random. [i]The Witness[/i] has a much more chic presentation and does some things better, like teaching new rules (it took me way, way too long to get adjusted to how the Red Gun works). And yet even [i]The Witness[/i], however great, pales in comparison; its series of similar puzzles seem clunky, same-y and unnecessary.\n\n[i]Antichamber[/i] isn't perfect. Some abilities are a bit clunky (like shifting cubes), the very ending has a puzzling jumping challenge that doesn't fit the game's tone, and it's also very hard to get back to if you've abandoned it for like a week. But these are all minor points.\n\nIt's a great game. You should play it. Everyone should. It requires zero special skills, only ingenuity, logic, perceptiveness, and the ability to think outside the box.

This pretty much sums up the experience... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's quite refreshing, actually. But let's start at the beginning - what is Antichamber exactly? It's not easy to explain. It's a puzzle game, but the puzzles you solve are not exactly of a traditional nature. The game is set in some sort of nondescript facility, comprised of interconnected hallways and chambers. Visually, the world is quite simple, made up mostly of bright white walls with a spattering of color here and there. You explore in first person and must figure out how to solve each room in order to progress. And that's where it gets even harder to explain. The solutions are far from clear-cut and there is no one main mechanic that is used from start to finish. You just have to think, experiment, and explore. Eventually you will find a tool that is able to manipulate small cubes that are scattered throughout the facility. But unlike in a puzzle game like Portal for instance, the cube \"gun\" is not the only component of the puzzle-solving experience (though it does become so later on). Rather, at first, you will likely just spend a couple of hours exploring, getting lost, and trying to figure out just what the hell is going on. It takes a little while to adapt to how the game wants you to think, but once you have learned how to solve certain problems, it opens up more of the world for you to explore. I know this explanation sounds very vague, but it's almost impossible not to be when trying to explain this game - it is very... unconventional. That said, I thought the game was really cool, though I can definitely see that it would not be for everyone. If you like games that have a clear goal, explain their mechanics well, and don't require much thinking, then this is most definitely not the game for you. If, on the other hand, you are curious to try something that is vague, never provides anything in the way of explanation, and has some truly \"out-there\" puzzles to solve, you just might find Antichamber to be a breath of fresh air. All in all, this is a worthy experiment in the puzzle game genre, and unlike anything else I have ever played. Check it out if you think it may interest you - just don't hold me responsible for how much hair you end up pulling out of your head in frustration.\n\nFinal Grade: B+", "timestamp_created": 1370194879, "timestamp_updated": 1370194879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799326896667480469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99315431": {"recommendationid": "99315431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018185954", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 925, "last_played": 1631579397}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, would love to get an Antichamber 2", "timestamp_created": 1631579416, "timestamp_updated": 1631579416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790753543376922607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71084514": {"recommendationid": "71084514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006537540", "num_games_owned": 1033, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1592584225}, "language": "english", "review": "Antichamber is a minimalist space-bending first person puzzler in the in the same vein as The Witness, The Talos Principle and, of course, Portal.

These form riddles that nudge you in the right direction for any particular puzzle.

The story is almost non-existant. The gameplay is enjoyable for most of the time although controls might be a little clunky sometimes. There are various puzzles and most of them have interesting and unusual concepts but they aren't very hard. Visuals and music are minimalistic but it fits the concept of the game greatly. It's one of these games where the less you know about it, the more you enjoy it.[/b]\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nThis game is about solving puzzles so there is almost no story except trying to find the exit from the maze. Sometimes you can spot some minor similarities with Portal, especially being trapped in chambers full of puzzles. Although in reality they seemed more like areas than chambers to me.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nMost of the puzzles have interesting concepts. Actually sometimes it's hard to call them puzzles but I don't want to spoil. Especially the beginning of the game is surprising but once you get the gimmick the puzzles become a little less interesting and way easier to solve. It might turn out that the biggest puzzle to comprehend is the maze you are trapped in. The controls might be a bit troublesome from time to time but nothing game breaking. \n\n[b]VISUALS[/b]\nThe design is very minimalistic, mostly in black and white and some bright colors. It fits the style of often abstract puzzles but not everyone may like it. Sometimes I've got motion sickness because of the game but it was usually happening when I was looking around too fast. Nonetheless have in mind it might happen to you as well.\n\n[b]SOUND[/b]\nMusic is minimalistic yet athmospheric. Any dubbing in this game doesn't exist.\n\n[i]Don't mind my recommendation because it is only my subjective opinion which shows if I've enjoyed the game or not.

While I did get that vibe and happily did so, Antichamber sometimes felt like it could get away with whatever it wanted and did so with crossed arms and shrugged shoulders to the player. The Steam store page does say, quote, 'Antichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted. Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward'. 'Accomplishing the impossible' may sound quite romantic to a player thinking about buying the game, but there are some cases where the impossible is possible, it just requires a ridiculous solution. To talk about these cases would just be absolute shameful spoilers and would take away from your experience, but the big pro tip here is that just when you think you've tried absolutely everything and are ready to give up, you actually haven't tried absolutely everything and need to try again. Not every puzzle in Antichamber is this 'impossible', as for a majority of the game your challenges are quite tame; blocks, switches, platforming, interacting with the environment, toying with some anomaly that's keeping you from progressing... Many of these can be solved just through expirimentation, trial and error or simple application of your brain, and for quite some time you can chug through the game at a steady rate, only meeting major opposition when you near the end of the game - And I mean major. Again, perhaps I'm the wrong kind of person for this kind of game, but at some point I ran up against puzzles where just nothing clicked and I found myself spinning my wheels in perpetual defeat, and that's where my enjoyment of the game took a heavy drop.\n\nWhat kept me from really getting sour on the game is that at just about any time you can return to the main 'hub' room where you can look at a map of the 'facility' (players have insinuated there's a story some kind, but there's no plot in Antichamber at all) and then teleport elsewhere. This means that you can zip around the game and try assaulting a puzzle again or from a different angle, never being stuck against just one challenge forever until you complete it. This is an absolute god-send of a feature, and one that no doubt has kept many players (including myself) from quitting the game with a bitter aftertaste. It's also incredibly useful since you can stumble upon shortcuts or alternate exits everywhere that will take you all over the place, sometimes not quite in the direction you wanted to go. If you keep hallway-wrapping into a room you've visited or accidentally fall off a bridge that melts if you're looking at it, being able to warp back and try again keeps frustration down to a minimum, especially when you're trying to find the matter 'guns' to further manipulate blocks that you need for switches, platforms or other impede your progress.\n\nThe 'guns' is the aforementioned cue from Portal, and how they help you get around the game is the other. Again, to talk in detail about the puzzles you'll encounter would be shameful spoilers, but each new gun upgrade you find unlocks that much more of the game, with a myriad of possible solutions and new challenges to run into, which is a good feeling of constantly asking yourself 'what's next?' when you unlock this door or find a way past this chasm. You'll be looking forward to the next puzzle and not to the designs of the rooms as a whole since the game's sterile white environment at times feels just downright oppressive on the eyes, save for the splashes of bold, full colors that are strangely relieving when mixed in with the 'music' that is nothing but ambiance noises that I feel were designed to keep the player as relaxed as possible when hopping around the game trying to figure out a new solution. Color doesn't play any sort of theme like in Okami, but it does serve as something to take hold of your attention and to differentiate one route from another to avoid confusion.\n\nWhile it sounds like I haven't had the greatest time with Antichamber, I walked away from it (and completed it) quite satisfied with the experience I had, and some minor technical hiccups like major frame-rate hitches during transitions and broken floor geometry were just that - Hiccups. Antichamber brings to the table a wildly different kind of puzzle game that sometimes can feel like it's cheating in order to challenge you, but overcoming these challenges brings personal accomplishment that is its own high. My overall enjoyment of the game left something to be desired, but I can still happily recommend Antichamber to those looking for a puzzle game that doesn't follow conventional rules.", "timestamp_created": 1413282734, "timestamp_updated": 1413282734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758597850799560547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8241663": {"recommendationid": "8241663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038312998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 787, "last_played": 1470710736}, "language": "english", "review": "Mind bending and addictive.

Cards on the table: Antichamber is a very cool idea executed well, but that's not enough to save it from being a profoundly unenjoyable game. While everyone should [i]see[/i] this game, very few should go to the trouble of actually [i]buying and playing[/i] this game. \n\nI really want to like the game, so I'm going lead with the bad so I can end on a positive note. Fortunately, the negatives make for a short list, so let's just get this out of the way. Antichamber is a frusturatingly tedious puzzle game that just loves to waste your time. This is the major bugbear and the single greatest reason I don't recommend actually playing the game yourself, were it not for this odds are good I'd be unreservedly recommending it. Now as a non-Euclidean puzzle game (P.S. Antichamber is a non-Euclidean puzzle game, more on that later) you'd be well within reason to argue that I'm just a big stupid head that can't brain good, but that's not the case, at least not here. The puzzles are themselves well crafted and pass by quickly, the tedium is in actually finding them. Antichamber is a free-roaming game, not a linear one.\n\nThe onus is on the player to find the puzzles, and at times complexity can reach Metroidvania levels. That is, if there was a non-Euclidean Metroidvania out there. Just how well this [i]doesn't[/i] work is really driven home by the map which\u2015despite referring back to it constantly\u2015I was still unable to make heads or tails of by the end of the game. I don't even know if it's a top-down or vertical view! I certainly wouldn't put it past the madmen that made this. All this amounts to a game where I easily spent half my time either wandering aimlessly or exploring dead ends. \n\nI can't emphasize the time wasted enough, and in this game in particular it's all the more irksome. Antichamber bills itself as a puzzle game, but that's not really true. It's a game for a genre that doesn't really exist yet, best described in contrast to traditional puzzle games. Where appropriately deep puzzle games like Hexcells or Spacechem have sufficient complexity to keep the levels entertaining on replay, Antichamber instead has novelty and cunning. Most of the \"puzzles\", and in my opinion the best ones are tricks where the player's goal is to tease out the sleight of hand, a little like in old \"I Spy\" or \"Where's Wally\" books.\n\nNeedless to say, it's never fun finding Wally the second time, and it's only exacerbated when finding Wally on page 24 rewards you by dumping you back to the second page for the dozenth time. And I can't really conceive of a compelling reason to do this kind of completely freeform design in the first place. Sure you might reasonably go with non-linear sections and alternate paths to bypass difficult puzzles, but not this. Anything but this. If you have the patience to tolerate such blatant and quite frankly [i]offensive[/i] disregard for your time, then you might as well add Antichamber to your cart now. I'll pay 2:1 odds that by the end of the review you'll own it.\n\nI really want to get to the good of the game, but am obligated to mention a few other minor negatives. First, the game has a unacceptable number of gameplay affecting bugs, that being a non-zero amount. The highlight of this was when I was unable to solve a puzzle to get the final stage of the gun-manipulator-laserbeamy-[i]thing[/i] because the bits of the puzzle kept despawning, rendering it unwinnable. After a half-hour I conceded incompetence and went to check a video guide, only to discover that the game itself was broken! In the game where the statement \"anything can happen\" is more applicable than any other, you need to have absolute faith that the game's dealt you a square deal, but after this I could no longer be sure. Besides that there's map limitations that prevent you from accessing some areas, timing puzzles, and at least one puzzle which I'm pretty confident was a time-wasting dead end. Mostly quality-of-life stuff that further aggravates the time wasting.\n\nAt last the positives, or depending on your perspective, [i]positive[/i]. I use the singular because really, I can summarise everything great about this game in one word: 'WOAH' with the 'O's stretched until the character limit. This is easily the single most original idea of the decade, perhaps ever. With the proper budget and team, a sequel could easily surpass Portal in every aspect except humor, but that may only be because Antichamber isn't a comedy game. The tone is all about an extreme minimalism wherein the puzzles are used to relate a little truism with its own little doodle. It's the perfect degree of abstraction for relaxation, with the folk wisdom there to keep everything grounded enough. I'd even call it 'comfy' if the whole thing wasn't eye-searingly white. If you play this at night, you honestly may want to wear shades. \n\nBut the game itself; as I said before it's a non-Euclidean puzzle game. Just stop, take a moment and consider that: this is MC Escher: The Game. [i]There is no precedent for this[/i], nothing I can say to make it suddenly all make sense. For the first half of the game you're bombarded with little scenes, vignettes that challenge your perception and force you to really visualize what exactly the \"box\" is you need to think outside of. If nothing else, Antichamber really knows how to put its best foot forward. The opening writes a hell of a check, but how well the rest cashes it is up to you.\n\nIn the second half, the game gradually transitions from mind\uff46\uff55\uff43\uff4b to voxel puzzles. This is where the game most closely approaches the traditional \"puzzle\" formula, and you can particularly feel the long shadow cast by Portal. This is all fine, they suit the game, but if you're expecting an entirely psychedelic experience from start to finish you may feel letdown by this focus shift. Personally, I couldn't really see any other way they could do it. The appeal of the lead is in the novelty, not the difficulty and if you don't want another Stanley Parable you need [i]something[/i] to pad out the game. \n\nOh yes, speaking of padding, you might notice that the game's not very long. Steam clocks my playthrough at five and a half hours, probably slightly quicker than average owing to an abortive attempt I made years ago, but no matter how you slice it this isn't a very long game. Strip out the all the time-wasting and you have about two hours of ideas in a three hour game. I have no qualms with this, I consider length to be pricing concern weighed against enjoyment of those hours, but that's just me. I hear quite a bit from people in such a hurry to get from cradle to the grave that they need to weigh their entertainment like meat at the market.\n\nIn the end, Antichamber is about novelty and nowhere will I wager you find more. Hell, it might even expand your mind a little. But is it worth your money? To my mind, no. It simply doesn't respect your time enough to justify the investment yourself, but I still fully recommend that you experience the game through a Long Play or Let's Play by someone with a modicum of savvy. If you buy into it yourself, be prepared to spend just as much time aimlessly wandering to actually [i]find[/i] the puzzles as you will actually solving them.

What is the Antichamber? I don't know. There's no narrative to the game. I think the game's sole objective is to make the player furious.\n\nBut everytime I enter a new area my frustration is replaced by the desire to discover. What more can this M.C.

Rinse and repeat.\n\nOccasionally I hear the ocean waves and the cawing of seagulls in the distance. This game is very atmospheric.

For that reason I'll avoid talking about specific puzzles in this review.\n\nAntichamber regularly breaks the rules. It does so very carefully, building upon its own kind of logic. Puzzle solutions that might seem too random or illogical if they were in another game, here are made to work through a masterful progression that subtly teaches you how to explore each new challenge.\n\nIn many ways it feels like you are visiting another universe that is similar, but not entirely the same as our own. As you play you are constantly questioning things that you otherwise would take for granted in order to learn the laws of this place. As you look around, the visuals are simple and easy to discern, yet often striking. Occasionally there are some uninteresting white rooms but by and large their use of line weight, perspective, color and contrast make for a memorable display.\n\nThe most familiar and comforting aspects of this world are its sounds. Sounds of nature, from birds chirping to thunderclaps, are at times paired with the right swaths of color to evoke serene feelings of home. The music is mostly content to quietly set the mood until the final stages of the game where it livens up slightly with a primal drum beat. This is at once both unexpected and strangely fitting with all the sounds of the wilderness featured prior.\n\nEach of the puzzles you solve typically rewards you with, and is sometimes preceded by, a sign on the wall that has a picture and a short phrase. They are written with a double meaning: part lifestyle mantra, part hint or clever tie-in to the puzzle you've just completed. I've seen some negative responses to these posters, calling them pretentious and full of themselves. I disagree. I see them as cute, tongue-in-cheek rewards for our efforts that are meant to be taken about as seriously as a fortune cookie. They may also be teaching you to play more than realized. Without a discernible over-arching story to the game, they further add to the game by giving it a voice and a bit of personality.\n\nMy chief complaint stems out of a system that I don't want to detail in order to avoid spoilers. Let's just say that in the middle portion of the game you are sometimes able to manufacture materials needed to solve puzzles. However, the process to do so isn't interesting and got tiresome as I had to repeat it while piecing together the proper solution to the problem at hand. It may be that I played things too conservatively by making more than I needed, but in a game that throws you so many curveballs, can you blame me?

For the most part, I enjoyed exploring what I thought might be the solution to a puzzle and being wrong. There were a few times, though, when being right felt kind of dumb.\n- I crashed the game about five times. Every time was due to one specific mechanic, wherein the game engine is evidently not designed to handle what I was doing to it.\n- There is no real story and reaching the game's end is underwhelming.

I thought maybe it was too psychological and non-linear, but I love The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide.\n\nSo I pushed myself for several hours past the point of losing interest early, and I actually covered a lot more ground, unlocking what appears (on the wall that tracks you) to be over 2/3 of the game, having solved over half of that.

The puzzles are very difficult but definitely manageable once you figure out the rules of the game, though some mechanics were a bit unclear and it took a decent amount of trial and error and toying around for me to understand them.

Was it fun? Ymm... Honestly yes and no... Some puzzles are fun, forcing you to think outside of the box and coming back later when you have the needed tools etc...\nHowever some of them are tedious and unfun. You're constantly wondering 'can I actually solve this puzzle or am I simply missing a new gun?' Even after you learn how the map works it isn't logical and easy to navigate around the world to find the next puzzle or means to progress further. While most gun abilities aren't too hard to figure out based on the puzzles following their acquisition it can be really annoying if you don't since the game doesn't really bother explaining the hidden functions or mechanics (while it can be seen as a positive since it forces you to experiment and find out stuff by yourself it can also lead to annoying moments where you're stuck for quite a while or going in loops just because you didn't know a gun X could do Y.\nCommunity did a fine job making spoiler-free guides but there should be no need to rely on them to have a good experience  in the first place.\nI still had a lot of fun playing this game, discovering its little secrets and exploring for the hidden cubes.\nWhile the concept of the game is really good and most of the puzzles are fun I sadly cant recommend the game unless you are that specific kind of a player who doesn't mind bashing their head against the wall to find a solution/correct path to progress. The devs went over the board in a few cases and what was supposed to be a fun puzzle, brain storming game sometimes becomes an annoying journey of guessing where is the next gun, figuring out the hidden mechanics (which fun in some cases can be also very infuriating in this game) and wondering wheres the next puzzle or if you can even solve it at the given time.\nCan it be 100% fun for some?

While its being one of the games biggest strengths, it is also one of its weaknesses. The game is designed to be experienced in a single sitting or over consecutive days/sessions, but these 2 things made it hard for me to do so:\n1. Game is hard, as hard as you can get without getting into niche stuff.\n2. While the graphics and music I found to be extremely fitting, they objectively become tiresome after some time.\nAlso it is worth mentioning that completing the game is distinct from solving all the puzzles. If you wanna come back to the game for the unfinished puzzles after a break, games design makes it hard to recall where you left off.

The same thing happens each time, I play for ten minutes or so and am drawn in by the (still) unique non-euclidean lateral puzzles before running headfirst into the true mechanics: block puzzles. \n\nAnd what a truly mixed bag of block puzzles they are. Antichamber contains within it one of the worst puzzle tools featured in any game. The block gun is finicky and so deeply frustrating to use and is such a slap in the face after a truly intriguing opening. After the elegant opening that demands you question your assumptions and truly observe cause and effect in this strange world, there follows only sloppy, linear logic cube puzzles where you're likely to get stuck because the game just didn't even try to explain one of its new mechanics. Fans might rebut that last point. \"Well the mechanics *are* the puzzle, stupid\" That might fly with the Witness, which constantly prompts you be creative and try new solutions (or to piss off till later when you've learned more), here there are tutorials that explain about half the mechanics of a new tool, leaving the rest for you to stumble upon by pure happenstance.\n\nHonestly it just becomes a slog, not helped by the complete lack of narrative motivation. There are hints and teases at the start: a mysterious black entity floats through unreachable corridors, mere inches away. These soon become just as absent as the lateral puzzles within the first half-hour, only showing up again at the honestly pretty dull conclusion. What you're left with are throwaway doodles with fortune cookie aphorisms, all as empty as the walls they occupy. These were cute a decade ago, but now just seem patronisingly low effort. The visuals too at first seem elegantly simplistic, but are eventually gratingly basic. It all feels low effort, when games like Baba Is You can utilise visual simplicity whilst manufacturing a unique and charming aesthetic, Antichamber is just empty. Narratively, visually, aurally, mechanically hollow. I can't bring myself to hate or even dislike Antichamber, but then I can't bring myself to like it either.
