"language": "english", "review": "Hearts of Iron 4 is a difficult game to review. Presented as 'the ultimate WW2 Grand Strategy Game' the game in many ways falls short of sticking to its theme.\n\nHOI4 has build its event system around 'focus trees' that tend to devolve the world into a chaotic alternate reality where plausibility is thrown out of the window. The designers have added ship, plane and tank designers that the game's AI has trouble handling and often tend to favour ahistorical - sometimes downright silly - designs. Logistics are not as constraining as they should be as it's relatively easy to quickly build ports and railroads, removing many of the historical constraints around theatres that were defined by logistics. The game also has many legacy features, open issues and AI difficulties that make it a prime candidate for a Stellaris style 'custodian initiative'.\n\nAnd yet....\n\nYet this may very well be the most interesting, addicting and satisfying strategy game ever created. The core flow of the game can be described as 'building up an army for a war that you are never quite prepared for and spending that war working around every compromise you ever made'. You often hear strategy games described as 'consisting of a number of interesting choices' and no game pulls that of as well as Hearts of Iron 4. \n\nIn the build up phase you work against the constraints of industry, policy and politics as you try to build up forces sufficient to carry out the strategy  you've decided upon - whilst simultaneously trying to ascertain the strategy of your opponents and attempting to hide yours from the enemy. The early game consists of an interesting 'tug of war' where democracies - who are the most powerful faction in the long run - are constrained by a population that is unwilling to go to war and have to work around various debuffs that are reduced by an increasing 'world tension' mechanic. Their opponents meanwhile are free to act, build and annex to their liking. However, the more aggressive they are the more they will increase the 'world tension' - thus empowering their opponents. All of these mechanics lead to a frantic race against time where all players have to a hundred things, but only have enough time and resources to do 50 of them well. To most people this will probably sound stressful. But anyone who likes strategy it will feels like an endless stream of interesting 'just one more' decisions and dilemmas as you attempt to carry out your plan to the best of your abilities. \n\nWhen war finally breaks out you are presented with one of the most interesting strategic puzzles that you can get in the entire world of video games. You have to manage your own logistics whilst trying to destroy those of the enemy. You will have to maintain your industry and production lines whilst trying to bomb those of your enemy into oblivion. Air, land and sea are all present and there is no single winning strategy for any of them. As daunting as this all may sound the game does a great job of automating and assisting with many aspects of the actual gameplay. Most of the time when you click on a button you are doing it to make an interesting decision - not fighting the interface (looking at you, the rest of the wargame genre).\n\nUnlike Paradox its other games, matches are short and are often decided in a few years. This not only means that the game if very replayable as the barrier to 'restart and try again with a different strategy' is very low.

Hearts of Iron 4, is the game where you can rewrite history, or in my case, hilariously mess it up beyond recognition. From the moment you boot up the game, you're greeted with a map that looks like someone spilled a jar of colourful jellybeans all over Europe. But fear not, for you are the mastermind behind this candy-coated chaos! You're like a kid in a candy store, and the candy happens to be tanks, air planes, and political ideologies. Now, let's talk about the AI. It's like having a chess match with a rubber chicken. You'll often find yourself thinking, \"Did the AI just send its entire army to invade Russia in the middle of winter?\" But that's okay because you'll be too busy trying to figure out how to invade France without accidentally conquering Luxembourg. The tech tree is like a mad scientist's dream. You can research things like \"Improved Dank Memes\" or \"Tea-Brewing Efficiency,\" (not really) and somehow, it all affects your war effort. You'll spend hours optimising your divisions, creating the perfect recipe for the world's most formidable sandwich, I mean, the army. And let's not forget the diplomacy. It's like trying to make friends at a middle school dance, except the dance floor is a battlefield, and your dance partner may declare war on you at any moment. Speaking of war, the battles are intense. You'll watch your troops charge into battle, only to realise they're all holding baguettes or sausages instead of guns because you forgot to equip them. But don't worry; it's all part of the learning experience. The multiplayer aspect of Hearts of Iron 4 is for you and your friends to enjoy together, unfortunately, due to the amount of time I've played this game, I no longer have friends, so let's move on. In conclusion, Hearts of Iron 4 is a game that will have you laughing, crying, and screaming at your screen in equal measure. It's a grand strategy game that's grand in every way, from its world-spanning conflicts to its ludicrous AI antics.

For example, without certain DLC your garrisons will eat so much manpower, that you will have none for future divisions.  This becomes a huge issue at later stages of the game.  The game has erratic computer allies that will sneak in and grab territory as an \"ally\".  Italy has a knack for example of grabbing French or Russian territory that you fought for and won due to the game mechanics.  Allies can be unreliable, usually entering you in situations that make no sense - like supplying you with outdated equipment only to pull out the rug from you later.  The air combat system is completely broken as CAP with fighters really requires two types of fighters, and there is no real advantage to very important aircraft characteristics (range for example).  Expect the computer to cheat to win battles.  They will literally out march your mechanized divisions to plug holes in their line.  Manpower restrictions are nearly zero for the computer - you can kill ten million Russians and they still won't capitulate.  Multiplayer to my knowledge has never properly synced and I don't know that it's ever been fixed.\n\nOn a positive note though, there is plenty of DLC available, so you can spend your hard earned cash on graphic and sound upgrades, or possibly some pointless secondary ally National Focus Trees.\n\nIf I were a new player I would not recommend for the above reasons.", "timestamp_created": 1678918863, "timestamp_updated": 1678918863, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597722053527832031", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142228264": {"recommendationid": "142228264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996962510", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 27292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3455, "playtime_at_review": 18659, "last_played": 1696544887}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really enjoyable and difficult strategy game.

This review is written with all major DLCs installed.\nThis is a rant review, reader discretion is advised.\n\nI have three main issues with HOI4 as it is today.\n\nIssue 1: Half-Baked Designers\nThe Idea of a in-depth ship designer seems nice, if done reasonably well, it would allow for a immersive experience with semi-faithful representations of real ships available to the play and allow them to modify ships or design new ones from scratch. That is not the HOI4 ship designer. \nIt is a half baked idea, that adds new tech to make ships more expensive to build and research but does not allow for a creativity, flavor or nuance. It is only marginally better than the sliders in place before. This is the case with all the designers. It's padding and complexity for no real benefit.\n\nIssue 2: Oversimplification of Air Wings\nin Update 1.12, Air Wings were reworked to have a size of 100. For Carriers the size is 10. There are several issues with this.\nFirst is immersion, most squadrons were factors of 3 or 4, not 10. Second is if you are a smaller country and one might want two smaller fighter wings instead of one big one; well if thats the case: screw you, you don't get to choose or strategize that anymore.\n\nIssue 3: DLC semi-required\nI would say just to play older versions but the older base versions game is has a serious lack of content, especially the focus trees, there is a reason Road to 56 was basically a must-install back in the day. So older versions is not an option and modding isn't either since the mods that 'fixed' the designers are all discontinued as far as I recall and there is no mod to bring back the old air wing manager.\n\nConclusion\nParadox really needs to rethink it's approach to DLC, the base game should be a complete and functional game that you can enjoy with out DLC. DLC should be OPTIONAL add-ons that add new thing the base game does not provide.\n\nParadox and other game developers need to stick to keeping systems and features simple, or put in the effort to make it complex but enjoyable, while getting something of value in a complex system you cannot achieve with a simple one.\n\nFinally, Paradox and other game developers should not oversimplify systems for the sake convenience if it means loss of control or features.", "timestamp_created": 1667376844, "timestamp_updated": 1667376844, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59261023998260498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143173855": {"recommendationid": "143173855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016523736", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1690847086}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright but don't bother playing without DLCs", "timestamp_created": 1690847018, "timestamp_updated": 1690847018, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59252399206161499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135943533": {"recommendationid": "135943533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117672066", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 233224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227771, "last_played": 1692927236}, "language": "english", "review": "After 3800 hours of this game I can say for 100% certainty that the gaming stockings do in fact improve your tank micro.

Now, you might be thinking, \"Wow, this guy must be a pro at the game!\" but let me tell you, I'm not exactly the brightest bulb in the box.\n\nI mean, I've been playing this game for years and I still have no clue how to declare war. Yeah, you read that right. No clue. Every time I try to click on that little button, I end up accidentally unpause the game or something equally embarrassing. It's like I'm a little baby mouse trying to figure out how to use a computer.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on playing as Australia. I mean, come on, who plays as Australia? I'm too scared to take on any of the big boys, so I just sit there twiddling my thumbs, hoping nobody notices me. It's like I'm a little mouse hiding in the corner while the big cats run around causing chaos.\n\nBut you know what? Despite my lack of intelligence and courage, I actually really enjoy this game. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is impressive, and it's always fun to watch the world unfold in different ways each time I play. And hey, at least I'm doing my part as Australia, right? Right?\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a game that will make you feel like a bumbling mouse with no clue what you're doing, then Hearts of Iron 4 is definitely worth checking out. And if you see a little mouse named Keith hiding in the corner, be sure to say hi and give me some encouragement.

"language": "english", "review": "The game is almost the perfect setup for someone who loves grinding, problem solving, and history. As it gets farther along the development path, it gets less fun though. I am sure a lot of the additions are great to players with lots of experience and time sunk into it and other grand strategy games. As a more casual player, I cannot keep up with all the new changes. I find myself looking for ways to simplify the game rather than play with all the new features. I think there's a silent group of casual players who feel like this. I have less time to play games than ever, and this is one of my all time favs, but i am more and more afraid to start the game and lose my only three hours of free time to some weird tedious mechanic that i dont understand. For casual players things like peace conferences, combat width, navy management, and an ever growing list of mechanics that get updated in dlc are all so inconvenient that i would prefer to use mods or cheat to not have to lose whats fun about the game to me. I just want to have a clear idea of what i want to do with each run and not have a deep understanding of the country im playing prior to playing it. I want to load the game, decide to defeat a faction as a little country and then plan out how to domino down nations to achieve it. I don't want to keep wasting 8 hours at a time on runs that go nowhere. Hopefully i am right and more players feel like this. (over)Complexity doesnt make the game good it just alienates new players.", "timestamp_created": 1668713945, "timestamp_updated": 1668713945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125621185": {"recommendationid": "125621185", "author": {"steamid": "76561199276389472", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27447, "last_played": 1692179380}, "language": "english", "review": "Hard to learn but after that it is really fun", "timestamp_created": 1668684619, "timestamp_updated": 1668684619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125177140": {"recommendationid": "125177140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348164411", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 247529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3166, "playtime_at_review": 165892, "last_played": 1696390657}, "language": "english", "review": "I have completed each and every single achievement in this game, it was pure, unhinged hell and I regret nothing. The pain, blood, tears, sleepless nights, stress, anger and frustration could not suppress my obsidian will. \n\nThis game is by far the most immersive, enjoyable and most well made strategy game I have ever played with devs that actually listen to the community. I recommend buying all the DLCs that add focus trees and/or game mechanics (so not the ones that add just music or textures) and I also recommend playing with mods because the modding community for this game is 420/69. The best mods in my opinion are Equestria at War (yeah I know it's a My Little Pony mod but listen, I was scared to play it also until I finally built up the courage to and it turns out to be the best mod in the game), Kaiserreich, Great War, Road to 56, 72 building slots, 150 dockyards, extra slots for tanks and ships, other mods like that.\n\nOk well that's all I have to say here so have fun and

However, it is not good for newcomers as it is very complicated but if you like micro or just strategy please get this game. Highly recommend the dlc as vanilla will get very stale. Dlc makes the game way way way more fun and complicated but you don't need to pay for all of them.

If you watch the gameplay videos of 2016, the year it was released, you will see that there is a big difference. This is a dense game, and is definitely not for everyone, especially if you\u2019re after things like nuanced diplomacy or more granular control over your armies in your strategy games. \n\nHearts of Iron IV places you in control of a nation during the build-up to the greatest conflict mankind has ever seen. At release there are two scenarios available - 1936 and 1939. The latter drops you right into the thick of it at the outbreak of war while the former allows you to prepare your chosen nation for a number of years in advance. There are seven major factions: USA, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, Soviet Union and Germany, each with their own special traits, bonuses and penalties. Players who like to root for the underdog will be pleased to know that Paradox have lifted the restriction on what minor nation you can play as. From Liberia and Albania to British Raj and Portugal - every nation on Earth is playable. There\u2019s just so much to it. So much to get lost in, to come back to over and over again. \n\nHearts of Iron IV drowns you in buttons and systems, intimidating new players but eventually granting experienced ones the ability to fine-tune almost every aspect of their war effort. All that depth and length isn\u2019t there for the sake of it, though, as everything you adjust and slide and click serves a purpose and will be reflected on the battlefield. Sometimes in minor ways, sometimes in ways that can shape the entire war.\n\nAnd what a war it can be. At the flick of a very big switch at the start of every game you\u2019re able to turn off HOI IV\u2019s \u201chistorical AI,\u201d creating one of video gaming\u2019s great alternate history sandboxes, giving players seemingly endless ways to start a war and then even more ways to fight one.\n\nThe running of your nation is done by your representative political party, which can be moderated by governmental decrees. Your choice of political representative is by no means static - put the right policies into place and you can overthrow it with a stance of your choice.\n\nTo further your nation\u2019s goals a number of initiatives can be undertaken through research and development, as well as a new feature named \u2018National Focus\u2019. Similar to a skill tree, National Focus lines are a way to quickly develop your nation and take on policies. You can\u2019t choose them all, though, and some parts of the tree are mutually exclusive.\n\nThere is no real currency in play in HOI IV. Instead there are a number of resources that are needed to produce units, supply your forces and ensure that trade is maintained. These come in the shape of civilian factories, military factories, naval dockyards and manpower. The first three can be built upon as you go, the latter is affected by population figures, national unity and your type of government. Without manpower your front-line units will dwindle and be poorly reinforced, too, so it\u2019s a figure that always needs watching. Your industry and production can all be bumped up by research and government policy, meaning that a careful balance can even redress some factions deficiencies at the start of play.\n\n[u]The game really breaks down into two main stages[/u]: the build up from 1936 to 1939 and the crescendo when war is finally declared on (or by) your nation. The former is fast-paced and lively as you go through organising and renaming fleets and armies, building infrastructure and waiting for research and National Focus timers to drop. It\u2019s a flurry of activity that is blistering compared to when you\u2019re deep into the war. Once it\u2019s in full swing it becomes a matter of days, not years. Tactics are tweaked, units maneuvered and enemy movement watched with a hawkish eye.\n\nIt is not only the national tree and army management that is important, but also trade and diplomacy have a great impact. \n\nIts beating heart is its intricate simulation of the industry and logistics that allow warfare to take place at all. Even the most gifted commander with the best technology and most elite soldiers would do best to knock out larger, more populous opponents quickly, as wise resource management and industrial development will almost certainly prevail in the long run. That factories, production efficiency, and developing your civilian sector can win you the war is an engaging realization that made me operate outside my comfort zone and think about global conflict in new ways. In addition to considering which ships to build and how many marines I needed to take Iwo Jima, I had to contemplate how to weigh arms production versus expanding my infrastructure in Michigan. I had to strike a balance with my manpower reserves between the factory floors and the front lines. A prominent industrialist in my government cabinet ended up making a larger contribution to victory across the length of the war than any hot-shot fighter ace or brilliant general. This all lends a sense of nuance and so many new, interesting strategic layers to the whole campaign.\n\nFinally, I would like to talk about mods, which are another part of the game, which will double your game time.\n\n[u]Some players think that the mod version of the game is more enjoyable than the original version[/u], I am one of those players, HOI 4 gives us the main materials and mechanics, and you can find yourself on very different battle fronts.\n\nThe total conversion mods are arguably the best of the bunch. These types of mods add and/or change so much of the vanilla content that it often feels like playing a completely different game. Some make the experience more realistic while others are purely fantastical in their settings. The common denominator among them is that all deserve some serious attention from fans.\n\nOnce you think you understand the main mechanics of the game, I definitely recommend you to play mods and try those separate ideas.\n\nI will list the mods that change the game, offer alternatives and make the game more fun that I definitely recommend you to try: The Road to 56, Millennium Dawn, Kaiserreich, The Great War, The New Order: Last Days of Europe, Cold War Iron Curtain: A World Divided, Old World Blues, Rise Of Nations, The Lord Of The Rings, New Ways, World Ablaze, Europe in Flames: AGORA and more on the Steam Workshop.\n\nI haven't commented on the DLCs but I think they should all be bought. All of them add mechanics that should already be in the game, but Paradox has seen this fit and this is the strategy to make money. In short, [u]I think all DLCs should be bought.[/u]\n\nYou may find it boring or confusing at the beginning of the game, but as you learn and explore, you will start to enjoy it and you will enjoy that deep gameplay.\n\nIf you've read this far, you should give it a try.

Short answer yes, long answer yes*.\nThis game is very enjoyable, I know some people who have over 2000 hours on this game. The fun part is that you can do a lot of different things in different playthroughs. Want to conquer the world as Australia using nothing but horses? You can! Want to forge a Central-American superstate starting as Mexico? You can! However most of these functions (especially focus trees are locked behind DLC. Most major nations  have a small underdeveloped focus tree in vanilla but when getting DLC the tree expands as well as adding new features and focus trees for minor powers which are also quite fun to play. The DLC are priced (usually) at 20 euros, although I would only buy them when in sale. This game however has another ace up it's sleeve: mods. There are some amazing mods out there that are incredibly fun, have a unique feel and some mods (like kaiserreich) are almost another game.\n\nOverall I'd rate this 8/10", "timestamp_created":

buy this game its not worth it, you can still hack this stupid no anti cheat game why even have multiplayer omfg, and also the ai are so retarded and they will loose alot or they can thrash you alot its so inconsistent rng is a big part of this but sometimes it doesn't feel right and it doesn't go your way even if you do everything right its so dumb and time wasting I had so much love for this game back in the day but with the many dlc's they just keep adding sorry cash cowing as I call it, whether adding good stuff and also bad stuff no it should always be must be good stuff updates but nope same as there games inconsistent as fuck, and now combat feels kinda broken and the ai for unhistorical is broken and also last but not least the dreaded peace negotiations my god its great what they were trying to do but made the world even more border gory even more so i think its such a shame I really liked this game and still do to some extent but now a days it doesn't feel right it doesn't feel the same, its like even for all the good stuff that was added even they have there downsides argh so frustrating and that is not a game because games are also meant to be fun a learning

"language": "english", "review": "I was kind of hyped, when I've launched the game for the first time and my thirst was quenched... until 3rd hour of gameplay. I've lost pretty fast, so decided to learn via outside tutorials and after watching them and spending dozens of hours in the game, I've come to conclusion: it is simply bad.\n\nWhat I've liked in the game:\n- Technology tree\n- Focus tree\n- Epoch of the game\n- Mods\n\nBoth mechanics are well written and work fine. Any issues with them I'll describe below. When it comes to epoch, I think all will agree that it's the best WW2 strategy game so far and if it's not, then it's the most famous. And mods, the essence of the game. If you don't play any HOI4 mod, you're missing some good fun, because mods don't require costly DLCs and offer much more possibilities, especially when you want to play alternative history.\n\nWhat I didn't like in the game:\n- dyplomacy or lack of it\nEven without historical AI focuses, it takes one focus goal to erase all progress towards alliance with any country, especially when playing in Europe.\n\n- DLCs\nSo many functions offering unforgettable gameplay are hidden behind a paywall and they often cost more than a game itself. I know Paradox DLC policy and I think spending that much cash on upgrades is not worth it.\n\n- Lack of uniqueness\nIf you don't have DLCs, almost every minor nation has identical focus and technology trees and those with custom trees have often too much focuses to complete. That makes you lose advantage, even when playing as a major nation in Europe.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want a strategy game based in WW2, I'd recommend it. If you want a GOOD strategy game based in WW2, then don't waste your money. If you want to buy the base to play the mods, go for it, but purchase the game on discount. I haven't tried any DLCs due to their price and will not buy any, unless their base price is at least 40% lower. If I buy a game for more than 25\u20ac I expect it to be complete and don't make me buy a bunch of DLCs, which cost another 100\u20ac, for a full experience.", "timestamp_created": 1684172221, "timestamp_updated": 1684172221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533061087131500244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141779615": {"recommendationid": "141779615", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048476303", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10405, "last_played": 1689981904}, "language": "english", "review": "i am bad at it so its bad", "timestamp_created": 1689015838, "timestamp_updated": 1689015838, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533012032508850098", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130619130": {"recommendationid": "130619130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880310705", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1690429855}, "language": "english", "review": "How the frik do i play", "timestamp_created": 1673419653, "timestamp_updated": 1673419685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533011257648468018", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128802261": {"recommendationid": "128802261", "author": {"steamid": "76561199035407319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 16980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 887, "playtime_at_review": 9533, "last_played": 1695778959}, "language": "english", "review": "kanye west simulator", "timestamp_created": 1671380142, "timestamp_updated": 1671380142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533011257648468018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144896422": {"recommendationid": "144896422", "author": {"steamid": "76561199232779840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2240, "playtime_at_review": 5826, "last_played": 1696210360}, "language": "english", "review": "good game for autists", "timestamp_created": 1692847607, "timestamp_updated": 1692847607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532890141010284424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130395599": {"recommendationid": "130395599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819893251", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "playtime_at_review": 86766, "last_played": 1696037229}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok", "timestamp_created": 1673142895, "timestamp_updated": 1673142895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532865941524505615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129394506": {"recommendationid": "129394506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844687667", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 77768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65357, "last_played": 1690136735}, "language": "english", "review": "This game used to be great, but the new DLC (By Blood alone) straight up makes the game worse, even if you don't have the dlc (they also released an update that downgraded the game).

The game is incredibly detailed, with players managing everything from diplomacy to production to military strategy. The level of micromanagement is immense, and the learning curve is steep, but the game is incredibly rewarding once you get the hang of it.\n\nOne of the strengths of Hearts of Iron 4 is its depth. The game has a staggering number of variables to consider, and players must constantly adjust their strategy to adapt to changing circumstances. The AI opponents are also well-designed, making the game a real challenge even for experienced players.\n\nThe graphics and sound are solid, although they're not the main draw of the game. The interface is well-designed and intuitive, and the controls are easy to use. The game also has a robust modding community, which can add even more depth and variety to the game.\n\nOne potential downside of Hearts of Iron 4 is that it can be very time-consuming. The game's real-time nature means that battles can last for hours, and players must constantly monitor their production and resource management. This can make the game feel like a full-time job at times, especially for players who want to dive deep into the details.\n\nOverall, Hearts of Iron 4 is an excellent game for strategy enthusiasts who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn its intricacies. Its depth and attention to detail make it a must-play for anyone interested in World War II strategy games.", "timestamp_created": 1681314181, "timestamp_updated": 1681314181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136571795": {"recommendationid": "136571795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198971726624", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8709, "last_played": 1692555523}, "language": "english", "review": "Best strategic game about WWII ever.

I'm not usually a fan of strategy games, but I was curious about what it was like to play as Finland during World War II. And let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nEven though I had no idea what I was doing, I was still able to have a lot of fun. The YouTube tutorials are helpful, the interface is easy to navigate, and the ability to play as a smaller country like Finland made me feel like I was able to make a real impact on the war effort.\n\nThe attention to historical detail is impressive, and it's fascinating to see how different decisions can change the outcome of the war. I'm sure I'll get better at the game as I played more, but for now, I'm just enjoying exploring and experimenting as Finland.\n\nIf you're like me and have never played a strategy game before, I would highly recommend giving Hearts of Iron IV a try.

Managing combat in the game is really in-depth and strategic and I really like how the game pulls it off, but the political parts of the game feel like a huge distraction. Especially with the DLC, the political menus are cluttered with random buttons and paragraphs of lore that only really feel like a chore, with the purpose being to change ideology or give buffs to your army/research. Which in of itself isn't a bad thing- the Soviet army in real life was in an awful state in 1942 and the game should reflect that. But having to manage 13 different political sub factions and leaders and gigantic branching focus trees in a game primarily about commanding and fighting a multiple-front war isn't the way of going about it. I also dislike how hard the game pushes alt-histories to the point of complete delusion. I know that alt-histories are nice when the original game gets boring after a while of playing it, and that HOI4 isnt designed to be realistic about every fact, but you have to stop and think about the actual possibility that the entirety of the Balkans do a complete 180 and agree to unite under a communist mega-state in the span of only 4 years. I feel like a better option would be to have alt-histories predetermined at game start, rather than needing to literally bend history in the span of 3 years to create a different war dynamic. This would allow for different factions and a shifted WWII rather than put up with multiple civil wars and a destroyed economy just to change sides. In a game primarily about fighting a war the player shouldn't have to care about politics.

The Game's Singleplayer AI is bad.\n\nSeriously, the AI simply can't stack up to a human player. Singleplayer is where you go to test things, routes, division templates, tank builds, or just to fool around. If you want a challenge, you have to go to the Multiplayer, which brings us to caveat 2.\n\n2. The Multiplayer is great, if you've got Discord.\n\nMultiplayer, honestly, is where the game stands out, when you can enter diplomacy with actual people instead of just a bunch of number machines masked as people. It tends to be frustrating at times, but hugely rewarding in others.\nIf you want to play this game online, get Discord if you don't already. It will save you some trouble later.\n\n3. DLC\n\nHoI4, like every Paradox game ever, is mid at base, and is relatively uncomplicated. However, this creates a lack of depth as well, and the game can get boring very fast. DLC adds a lot of much-needed depth and extra features into the game, which makes getting the full game with all of its moving parts somewhere around a 200$ investment. Not great.\n\nIf you can look past all of these, then you can probably enjoy HoI4.\nHave fun, and remember to stay hygenic. Don't be the guy who hasn't showered in a week because he's trying to figure out the greatest possible strategy. \n\nOh yeah, minor fourth tenet:\n\nDon't sweat too much.

release date after waiting for years for it. Played it and i thought it was terrible and didn't play it since until last week. \n\nIt looked cartoony, it felt at the time that it was a 'arcade/console' version of 3, designed for kids rather that a adult that loves playing strategy games for the last 25 years, and ofcourse the game was empty with the idea of filling it with DLC's (shock). \n\nThe army organisation regarding crops and the air wings was and still is terrible. The game is censored and was missing quite alot of things I would expect from playing HOI3+black ice.\n\nAfter coming back to it after several years (Only because of the \u00a33.99 subscription for all the DLC's) there is far more content, the air side of things is still terrible, the army organisation still winds me up, but that is countered by the volume of content. \n\nI doubt I would ever play multiplayer as I don't have the time and the community seems a bit aids. \n\nAs per most paradox games, if you want to learn how to play the game you need to go on the website and read through 1000's of pages of trading cards numbers, or go on youtube - but work out if they are talking about single player or multiplayer.\n\nOverall, as someone who loves history, despite all its faults, I am enjoying playing this game, thanks to the subcription as i would never pay \u00a3100's for the DLC for this game -

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives

The famous Von Manstein versus a no-name rank 2 Soviet general btw. Same situation with Crimea. Seems kinda broken in that aspect. Noticed this in El Alamein province as well. This almost completely kills your Germany game if Britain holds Suez. The Desert fox doesn't perform well in North Africa sadly, and Mussolini incompetence in game is frustratingly accurate to real life.

This game will not be pleasant if you have just a basic grasp of ground fighting and air combat. However, once you get the naval component and how all the national foci interact and affect your nation, the game becomes really entertaining and addictive. Initially, I tried to play this game with the assumption that I wouldn't use my navy or airforce at all (as I didn't comprehend them) and that it would be OK. But it's not. As in reality, trying to play as France without an air force or navy and relying only on infantry is a fatal mistake that will result in failure. The fleet impacts trade, which influences production, which in turn influences the army. Everything is linked. To appreciate this game, you must master all of its mechanics. Once you've mastered the game, you should disable the historical AI. This suggests that the AI will not strive to comply with past records (Communist Russia, Fascist Germany,etc.). This opens the door to some rather weird possibilities, such as a communist United States, a democratic Germany, or even a Fascist Germany and French partnership. This assures that each performance is one-of-a-kind!

You'll need pull yourself out of the action to understand why things don't work.  The action you pull yourself out of, is a front you focused on in a war. Eventually you'll figure it's not only tactics related, but equipment for your troop is missing, so you pull yourself out of the battle at all.

And there you realize that besides out-maneuvering other tank divisions on a battlefield, there is always a bigger picture to take into account.\n\nHearts of Iron IV is a hardcore strategy game, but it is extremely rewarding!

In these cases you have 2 choices, attack with zero supplies (really bad idea) or wait a long long time for one supply hub to being build.\nAnd the second would be the peace deals.

I wouldn't have thousands of hours if I wasn't having fun some of the time.[/h1]\n\nBUT... A LOT of the features don't deliver.\n\n[h2/]Front Lines & being surrounded.[/h2]\n\nFor example, the use of Front Lines doesn't work when surrounded by a single enemy eg Playing Soviet Union's National Focus, picking UFA as your starting location.  Your front line will be extended right around your territory & back to the start again.  This forces deployment of divisions into low priority and low supply areas.  Additionally, which section of the \"front line\" each army (group of divisions) has responsbility shifts without warning and the front line market can also go on & off unpredicably too. As pockets are created, without input from the player, divisions from the advancing front are reallocated to the new fronts around the pockets.\n\nTo stop this from happening, you have to use Fall Back Lines & micro manage units - NO BATTLE PLANS FOR YOU & this is supposed to be a strategy game.  Without Battle Plans, the optimal \"strategy\" is probably to allow the enemy to advance into low supply & suffer attrition & debuff.  As divisions defect to you, convert them to 1 brigade inf or cav as you need to have full coverage of your prioritiy areas & have something to ninja towns & accellerate the soviet collapse.\n\nIn addition to being prevented from using battle plans, you are allowed to use exploits exclusively.  I feel like I'm being forced to roleplay as the Spiffing Brit.\n\nI would much prefer to create two fronts, one pushing west, one pushing east with a few divisions defending intervening towns & perhaps a mobile force to  deal with the enemy as it pushes from the north & south.\n\n[h2]The devs continue to release DLC when not all features work as advertised.  I can't really add anything to Youtuber 71Cloak's excellent testing.[/h2]\n\n[h2]Navy[/h2]\n\nI am one of a small mintority of players that persists with the navy system, in part because I don't play multiplayer and can afford to indulge in entirely non-meta builds.  The Devs has not abandoned this element it needs some Quality Of Life improvements.\n\nWhile you can make a ship \"detach\" from a Task Force for repairs, - it's still part of the Task Force & won't be relieved by hulls of the same symbol from reserves.  It's not clear to me how Ports are selected but there are times where ports with the capacity to repair one ship are choseen while other ports with higher capacity nearby are empty.  I don't understand how ports are picked but they can be on the other side of the globe.\n\nPlayers should be able to alocate sea zones for operation & sea zones for access to ports to minimise waste of time & fuel, and risk of ambush.  Instead we can only choose sea zones for operation, any friendly port may be an option for repair - unless you mark that port for not repairing.  As Soviet Union, I have had Vladivostok hulls going to Leningrad or Sebastopol for repairs.  As Japan, Toyohara have ships qued up for repair while Kansai will be empty.  A similar experience for the UK where Ships will be qued up in Alexandria & you cannot allocate other nearby or not so nearby ports as options.\n\nWhen screening falls below 100%, there is no warning to the player.  Sometimes of a Capital Ship which are in short supply for screening Carriers.  It's left up to the player to Micromanage their task forces without any kind of warnings or controls regarding screening requirements.\n\nThis might not matter if you are playing the USA, but if you are playing the japanese, efficiency is everything.  You shouldn't have to return an entire Task Force to port.\n\nYou also have no User Interface support for seeing the Top Speed of each ship in Task Force, you have to inspect the design of each vessel one by one.  While it's theoretically possible to build a Task Force to specification, in practice you have a bunch of obsolete ships especially capitals.  Being choosy over which ships to leave behind in favor of a faster task force should be viable.  Instead the pinacle work around is likely players setting on hard limits for ship speed & designing around that, and setting design symbols by speed brackets.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1696232943, "timestamp_updated": 1696232943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147459583": {"recommendationid": "147459583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102168129", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6121, "last_played": 1689063942}, "language": "english", "review": "100h and I know the basics... at least a bit.

The game has both pros and cons. I will try to describe everything in detail. Let's go in order.\n\nI will warn you right away that this is my subjective opinion and it may differ from yours, you can either accept it or throw it in the \"trash\".\n\n[b]Pluses[/b] \nProbably, it's always better to start with the pros, with the positives of the game, because a potential player should know about them first of all.\n\n[u]1. Content.[/u]\nHere it is worth mentioning about DLC and modifications of players (teams).\n\nIf we are talking about DLC produced by the company, then they observe historicity in them, while alternative ways of passing the game are created, and the player himself decides how to play. With the help of developers, different mechanics are embodied in the game, with almost every DLC released.\n\nBut do not forget about the enthusiasts who produce interesting modifications, because they bring variety to this game. So, for example, there is a modification for modernity, World War I, alternative outcomes of World War II, Cold War, Star Wars, etc. And these people are also adding new mechanics to the game, which is very pleasing.\n\nIt is also worth saying that you can create a modification yourself, such as you see it.\n\nI personally tried to change the map, create new states, do localization, try new mechanics, etc., without having any programming experience.\n\n[u]2. The scale and availability of choice.[/u]\nHere I want to say one thing. These developers are famous for their scale in their projects. Here you are given a choice of all existing states, you can govern whomever you want and how you want, you can become a communist, a fascist, a democrat, maintain neutrality, and with modifications you are given more ideologies, which is very cool.\n\nYou can also make an industrial, economic and military giant out of your country, create many puppet states, make an alliance with the enemies of your enemies, impose an embargo on a state that did not please you, etc. Not every game in this genre can boast of this criterion.\n\n[u]3. Warfare and AI.[/u]\nThe game has a fairly strong and well-developed AI, which causes great interest to fight with it. He will not attack you head-on, he will try to find weak points in the defense and go to attack there, or land troops on the coast. But sometimes he is unpredictable and will deviate from these standards, which is even more interesting.\n\nAlso, creating your own divisions (templates for them), various modifications of equipment is still a pleasure. You will mess around in them for hours until you find the best option for yourself.\n\nSo, for example, I assembled a fleet of 3,000 ships, built 70,000 aircraft, mobilized tens of millions of people in order to fight with the whole world.\n\n\nAt this point, I have everything on the pros and it's worth going to the cons.\n\n[b]Minuses[/b]\nAny game or project always has two sides. And no matter how you turn it, you can't get the negative anywhere.\n\n[u]1. Price[/u] (here I am talking about my region and I cannot be responsible for others).\nThe price is quite biting at as much as 1300 rubles. (about $ 15, excluding DLC), and with all DLC about 8000 rubles. (that's about $ 89), which is shit. Not everyone is willing to spend that kind of money to get the whole game.\n\nBut here it is worth mentioning a couple of points.\n-It's better not to buy all the DLC at the beginning, since you first have to get used to it, understand all the mechanics.\n-You can wait for discounts on DLC and buy them at a reasonable price, as I did.\n\n[u]2. System requirements and optimization.[/u]\nHere it is worth talking more specifically. This game can be run even on an old PC, but here a small dilemma arises. Yes, you can run it and even play it, but not in player modifications (tested personally), since the amount of content in user modifications is much larger than in DLC, thereby the game is very heavily loaded. Even with a standard game, after what time the game starts to lag very much, which is very depressing, although at the moment I have a pretty powerful PC.\n\nThis is all happening, according to my assumptions, because of bots that seek to create a large army that surpasses you in all directions. And there's nothing you can do about it, unless you delete their armies through the console, but then it makes no sense to play on, as for me.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nNow I will summarize all of the above. The game will be interesting to those who like strategies, because there are no such opportunities as in it in any game, well, at least there is not a single name of the game in memory. The game is developing and its potential is great. But its price is quite high, which can scare away an interested buyer, which is a minus, with a very serious one, and optimization begins to limp at a certain moment. I will say one thing, that as a fan of strategies I recommend this game.\n\nBut, of course, buying this game is only your choice.", "timestamp_created": 1689268634, "timestamp_updated": 1689757379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141821176": {"recommendationid": "141821176", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002438642", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1695, "playtime_at_review": 5515, "last_played": 1696510368}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my favourite game of all time.

It has the bones of a truly great game. It has engaging ground combat and an excellent community that makes good use of its modability to deliver some of the highest-quality fan content you'll find for a game.\n\nIt also has bugs, broken AI, and system after system duct-taped onto the existing structure with seemingly little regard for whether or not these new systems will improve things.\n\nParadox has unfortunately been taking the game in a direction that I greatly dislike by adding more and more micromanagement without doing much more than slapping band-aids onto important systems like the AI.\n\nThe AI is perhaps the worst of this game's faults, especially since you're pretty much guaranteed to have to deal with it even in MP games. The AI is, to put it succinctly, brain-dead. It is unable to distinguish between types of units. It'll produce marines and then send them to the frontlines, while having standard infantry divisions attempt to launch naval invasions. And when it decides to launch naval invasions, nothing will stand in its way, not naval patrols, the inability to supply the beachhead, or even a literally nonexistent chance of successful landing. Regardless of any of these issues, the AI will attempt again and again to invade the same place, losing thousands of men.\n\nEven ground combat is not safe from the AI's stupidity. Paradox overhauled the supply system in No Step Back, but failed to take the opportunity to improve the AI's complete inability to take supply into account. The AI will happily cram millions of men onto fronts that can support only thousands, and sit there impotently as their troops all starve to death. This only gets worse in the late game, as the AI will pump out hundreds of divisions and stick them everywhere. As a result, it's actually a mistake to ally with AI nations, as they'll choke your supply lines with divisions, turning any front they're allowed to be a part of into a stalemate as both sides of it sit around, unable to do anything due to lack of supply.\n\nInstead of tackling important problems like these or improving the lackluster diplomacy or internal politics systems, Paradox mostly pumps out DLC adding focus trees (which can be gotten for free off of the workshop) and new ways to micromanage even the most minor details of your armies. You can't make peace with a nation without utterly destroying it and conquering most of its territory, but you can decide how many machine guns go onto Fighter Design #3 in your air force.\n\nAlong with the equipment designers, of course, comes tech tree bloat. It was already the case before they were introduced that you could probably only focus on getting two of your three military branches to be competitive. Now, with the enormous number of technologies to research for tanks, ships, and aircraft, it's that much more difficult to make well-rounded militaries.\n\nThe focus on equipment designers and focus trees seems to betray a lack of real commitment on Paradox's part to making HOI4 a good grand strategy game. The ability to design equipment to such a degree can be cool, but it's much more important to, for instance, have AI that can at least understand that it's a bad idea to put 5 million-man armies in the deep jungles of the Congo.\n\nMaybe Paradox will fix these issues eventually, but I won't be holding my breath, since they've been around for years and years at this point. My suggestion would be to wait for HOI5, as maybe with a fresh start Paradox will tackle some of this game's pitfalls.", "timestamp_created": 1683763629, "timestamp_updated": 1683763629, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138062204": {"recommendationid": "138062204", "author": {"steamid": "76561199025022687", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 403, "playtime_at_review": 52811, "last_played": 1696134506}, "language": "english", "review": "good game but started havin way less sex after i started playin", "timestamp_created": 1683662086, "timestamp_updated": 1683662086, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138023599": {"recommendationid": "138023599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990700704", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1098, "last_played": 1683691367}, "language": "english", "review": "a man kan play as the 3rd empire of Germany what more kould 1 man wish for \nvery fun although komplikated kontols and takes a lil to learn\n\n1488", "timestamp_created": 1683589978, "timestamp_updated": 1683589978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137922923": {"recommendationid": "137922923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408959820", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 15202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1250, "playtime_at_review": 2450, "last_played": 1696355073}, "language": "english", "review": "millions must die", "timestamp_created": 1683433829, "timestamp_updated": 1683433829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137748949": {"recommendationid": "137748949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220217148", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3304, "last_played": 1683146156}, "language": "english", "review": "NEVER start a war with mali... worst mistake of my life...", "timestamp_created": 1683146185, "timestamp_updated": 1683146185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137208677": {"recommendationid": "137208677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086122663", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 55554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54545, "last_played": 1694748192}, "language": "english", "review": "My review is rather long but In summary, this is a good game, but to get to that greatness, you will have to pay in what I feel, is an excessive amount of money. At least wait till a sale before getting it.\n\nFull review: Don't get me wrong, everything that Paradox gives you from the base game and DLC is a great and fun experience. You can easily sink hundreds of hours into it. But I do not like how Paradox handles DLC. That in itself is a joke and an example of abuse we've seen with corporations like EA.\n\nMy biggest regret is buying Paradox DLC for their original price. Together for about every one of your games, the DLC is multiple times the cost of just the game for content that either barely expands the game or adds to the game content that should've been there since day one that moders have added for free in much grander ways than Paradox could've ever.\n\nAnd I don't believe the excuse that the DLC funds future development or bug fixing since the majority of developers do so without the excessive DLC milking or DLC at all. Like seriously. I remember way back when hoi4 was first before there was  DLC that gave China, Russia, Poland, and more super in-depth focus trees and tech years before Paradox \"invested the time and work\" making there own that fell short of the mods in my opinion. And what's with the lack of vehicle images in the research. Why do we need to pay you for pictures of those techs are already in the base game to use.\n\nREALLY!!! Pictures for vehicle tech that we can get in vanilla?!?! Why do we need to pay 6$ for pictures?! Absolutely stupid and ridiculous and no justification for it. \n\nNow this isn't to say Paradox isn't to be able to make DLC at all. But it really feels like a joke when the mechanics of building custom ships, planes, and tanks are pretty much a copy paste of each other but are grouped separately to focus trees that moders have already done better and for free. To me those expansive mechanics should've of just been one DLC together.", "timestamp_created": 1682305850, "timestamp_updated": 1682305850, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137184564": {"recommendationid": "137184564", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112650593", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 161, "playtime_at_review": 4707, "last_played": 1695495449}, "language": "english", "review": "This game could be hard to learn, but when you get into it everyday and play it can be fun.

hundreds of dollars despite being worth way less. wouldn't surprise me if their new cities skylines 2 game has even less, then makes you buy basic things again. pyrate it, paradox already infinitely dipped into peoples pockets for content barely worth more than one dip. this type of business should be illegal and at present is one of numerous reasons why gaming industry is cancer and a curse on

game (and probably originally was & has been shelved to release at meticulously placed intervals) you wouldn't buy a new car then be expected to also buy the engine, seats, steering wheel, windows,

Well\u2026 The Italian military by 1965 probably has some red support in there, after all the red belt was heavily populated and where a good portion of Italian soldiers came from, so yeah, there would be some reds, but this is ignoring a crucial part of the military, the generals. By 1965 the Italian generals probably still have support for the fascist government. Under fascism Italy won the second largest war in history, and was able to beat the french, and also maybe the Turks and Iberians (not sure if red Italy requires Italy to lose to the Turks). \ud83d\udc73 \ud83d\udc73 \ud83d\udc73 They, like in Russia, would likely not defect to the reds without a fight, and provides even more evidence that a large scale revolution in Italy probably could not be done without a civil war. Not to mention that military censorship of news in addition to the soldiers from the south, means a good portion of the military would probably be against the revolution.I will give every 1984 commenter a one-day tempban.\n\nThe TNO community should have a sane path?

It all works ok in the beginning but as the the front lines get longer and there are more units to control in a long play session the AI seems to get a bit buggy and calculates the movement of my units in a very detrimental way (they will either decide to make moves that cause them to loose all organization or they ignore the front line and \"move\" in a fight you never wanted to start or a unit can't make up it's mind and decides to start switching the direction it wants to go, for days; or units decide to move all the way to the other end of the front even though you set the order to use limited movement) and the fight will just spiral out of control and ruin your game if you don't catch it early and find a way to stop it (maybe save and give the game a break so the AI can reset and find it's bearings again)\n\n2. You have no reasonable option available to just order a unit to just dig in and hold the province you placed it on and defend a critical point (sure you can use some work-around with the existing mechanics but they are not easy to manage e.g. make really small armies or LOTS of separate fronts that are hard to manage)\n\n3. The game has a hard time dealing with situations where countries who are not allies end up in the same war: when a front line moves (as provinces are occupied) it will get split in two lines and split the armies to defend against the other country fighting on the same side as you even though you are not at war with them. Basically it handles poorly situations when neutral armies end up stuck on the same side of a war. There is no setting or order I can find that would prevent this..\n\n4. encirclements are a nice strategy to use in this game but again the front lines can get really weird when you try to make one and can easily happen to force all the units to move around causing them to loose entrenchment \n\nI hope this will improve over time.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1678060255, "timestamp_updated": 1678551134, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126789306": {"recommendationid": "126789306", "author": {"steamid": "76561199093085968", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1695958997}, "language": "english", "review": "i spent too much money on this", "timestamp_created": 1669372180, "timestamp_updated": 1669372180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126788232": {"recommendationid": "126788232", "author": {"steamid": "76561199118342524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 165960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 139491, "last_played": 1696450410}, "language": "english", "review": "my wife and kids dont give me the joy like world conquest as luxembourg does", "timestamp_created": 1669371593, "timestamp_updated": 1669371593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520547926425933838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123413904": {"recommendationid": "123413904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021268144", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 6743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1107, "playtime_at_review": 4292, "last_played": 1695841088}, "language": "english", "review": "I would never have bought this with my own money.\n\nThis game doesn't deserve to have a \"Very Positive\" rating it has.

Attacking from multiple directions and/or axii is a recipe for trouble, for example Germany attacking Poland from both East Prussia and Brandenburg. The fronts get tangled up upon joining from multiple axii of advance as if a cat ran headfirst into a Christmas tree, got stuck, struggled as if about to die and was meshed in all the needles and tinsel, then ran away and took the entire f--kin' thing down as it went. The frontlines were supposed to help the player evade needless microing, but it turns out the only way to ensure nothing stupid happens is to babysit the damned AI. \n\nSome of the worst border, or in this case Front-Gore I've seen in a Paradox game is from frontlines getting messed up, multiple nations getting pockets of units all over the place, as well as the AI at times stretching an army of 24 divisions aaall the way through the entire Soviet Eastern front, and just having the divisions stand in place, or aimlessly reassigning them in reaction to other armies capturing territory. The AI is bad overall and the Frontline UI is pretty terrible. There are keybinds and hot buttons galore, and playing with them feels like entering a cheat code to a retro game from the 90s. How is it this complicated and awkward to order simple pincer move? Which the AI will likely mess up, anyway. \n\nSupply mechanics are atrocious, and the game does not know what information to share with the player. \nFor example, I just had game as Germany invading Norway around Early '39. A single army of some marines, mountaineers and infantry, with air support. Far superior to the defenders, I'd add. The issue is, that the player has no idea what is causing the army to lose so much gear. \nIt's actually infuriating. That single army seems to go through tens of thousands of units of Infantry Equipment just marching in Norway, and having the occasional battle with far smaller Norwegian defenders. How much equipment are they using, and why? I dunno. The game doesn't tell me. I just eyeball the supply strength bar and scratch my head. \nWhat am I losing that equipment to? Enemy activity? Attrition? Angry Norweigian M\u00f6\u00f6se attacking at night, stealing the Gerries' bang-bangs to sell to biker gangs?\nSome of those divisions have done nothing but stand in mountainous provinces for a few in game weeks, and are at 60% equipment strength. I'm guessing this is due to logistics getting stretched, but come on-- The game does not tell me that. So, in turn the player does not know how to amend the situation. The roads seem fine, the rail network isn't off, and my side has the air superiority, as well secure naval routes with a high level ports close-by. \nTalk to me, tell me, game! This is not Victoria 2 where one just stumbles across a solution to a problem sifting through spread sheets, and having an A-ha! - moment, but more like the Atari E.T. falling into a poorly hit boxed pit and floating out tens of times each minute. It feels like I'm fighting the game mechanics, and not the enemy forces. It's frustrating. \n\nThen there's combat, and naval invasions which tie into both issues. \nIt's annoying how combat has only one speed and intensity. One is either attacking, defending or passive. There's no scouting or skirmishing, just full on First Day of Somme all the time. This means armies on broad fronts can attack, and go through massive amounts of stacked equipment in a matter of days. And of course the player isn't told what is causing those losses. Enemy air power? Tanks pounding the front? Artillery? Infantry waves? Armies can be full green, about to win a battle at 90% progress, and still hemorrhage tanks and infantry equipment to the point of any large offence being a Pyrrhic affair at best. \nThe commander AI is bad, and has a tendency to either play self-destructively aggressive, or move the divisions into an optimal place before an assault, and do this slowly enough that front shifts before being finished, after which the AI is likely to do this again, and again. \nThe battles proper are simplistic, with rather crude modifiers for attack, defense, breakthrough and armor piercing affecting combat rounds. This is often moot, as the side with the better supply will usually win. Generals pick doctrine modifiers from a list of unlocked tactics, which are rather underwhelming. The tactics used in a battle do not affect the larger operations much, if at all. \nA victory in a single province does not affect the other active combats in any way. E.g. crushing the enemy in one province does not cause organization damage of any sort in the neighboring province, unless attacking from the newly opened avenue. The speed is either stuck at Verdun, or the breakneck brutality of the invasion of Poland. \nNaval invasions are poorly implemented. One *has* to supply an invasion through a port, and there is no way to create an Overlord type of beachhead at a suitable location, and move inland from there. Coasts cannot be raided and probed for a weak point and maybe grabbing a poorly defended island or a base. Maybe a beachhead could be established over the weeks, and the defender would have to rush in order to smash the fledgling landing. Instead, one has to capture an existing port, and once landed an army cannot retreat unless via port. There are no Dunkirk saves in HoI4. \nNaval invasions are awkward, and take very long in-game to plan and execute. \n\nIt just makes cheesing the AI the only solid way to win consistently. Knowing the game isn't understanding the supply or the tactics, but seeing exploits all over and using them. This is not to evade enemy power, as is, but to make sure one doesn't get tangled in the bad frontline mechanics and supply system. \n\nAnd these issues either haven't been fixed over the years, or more problems have appeared with expansions. It's not the worst game ever, but do I recommend investing hundreds of hours to it? No. Hearts of Iron 4 is some messy and wonky Grand Strategy. Try this one on discount, get the DLC subscription and see if it tickles you. It's more like an occasional slight rash i get, and I subscribe to the game thinking 'Why'd I stop playing before?' and play a campaign for a while and it call comes rolling back, like a very persistent case of slight winter dandruff.", "timestamp_created": 1685380396, "timestamp_updated": 1685385366, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520410358905792236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146945780": {"recommendationid": "146945780", "author": {"steamid": "76561199178718317", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1664309085}, "language": "english", "review": "turns people into tryannys", "timestamp_created": 1695573240, "timestamp_updated": 1696210963, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520201981067657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136799902": {"recommendationid": "136799902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276114952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 65726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 712, "playtime_at_review": 58949, "last_played": 1696114721}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1681647420, "timestamp_updated": 1681647420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520201981067657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136432962": {"recommendationid": "136432962", "author": {"steamid": "76561199152685998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36539, "last_played": 1690985742}, "language": "english", "review": "Slovakia strong \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa", "timestamp_created": 1681071960, "timestamp_updated": 1681072041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520201981067657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136431304": {"recommendationid": "136431304", "author": {"steamid": "76561199367493272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1848, "playtime_at_review": 12289, "last_played": 1696543519}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have all of the DLC's its a pretty great game, although it costs somewhere around 80 to 100 dollars to get everything, not to mention that if they add a new DLC then thats another 19.99 dollars ya gotta spend to get that.", "timestamp_created": 1681070036, "timestamp_updated": 1681070036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520201981067657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127422522": {"recommendationid": "127422522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830928657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 88700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 248, "playtime_at_review": 65254, "last_played": 1696530648}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, probably the best introductory paradox game placed in a setting that is most familiar to a general audience.

While not as in-depth as its predecessor yet, this game has a very good foundation that if used in the right way could make it better than the rest. However, sadly it seems this game suffers from a multitude of problems that plague other Paradox games, as well as very limiting design features. Instead of being a comprehensive list, I\u2019ll just name the ones that stand out the most to me:  \n\n- [b]Repetitive gameplay; hard to approach systems.[/b] This game relies on focus trees for most of its main decisions, which are a system which is inherently limiting and repetitive. For a game that prides itself on going a different way in history, there isn\u2019t much in the way of choice (let alone nuance) besides just \u201cdemocratic\u201d or broad big-tent fascism, communism, or the occasional monarchist/non-aligned. Besides that there is the industry with more in-depth systems for tanks or your navy you can play around with, but those systems are often the other way; far too complex and hard to approach, with no little in the way of tutorials to teach them. This leads to most players just flat out giving up on those rather large portions of the game, which leaves the often long waiting period till war very tedious, and inevitably little in the way of reward. \n- [b]The lack of content without and outside of DLCs.[/b] I know we still get some free updates, but much of the base game is still almost [i]criminally[/i] undeveloped without any expansion packs, or nothing if you\u2019re a country outside of the scope of any content updates. Then even still if you own a few DLCs, good luck if they have any outdated focus trees or reworks in them, because it\u2019s a rarity for them to come back and fix stuff; especially without making a whole new DLC on top of another. Don\u2019t get me wrong, some of the stuff they've done with supply (No Step Back) and intelligence agencies (La R\u00e9sistance) are fantastic, but come on, we did pay for a whole game here. \n- [b]The lack of actual simulation of a state, and especially more so the lack of representation of historical atrocities like the Holocaust.[/b] While I know this can\u2019t be Victoria level state-management (though that would be nice) there needs to be a level of internal workings simulated outside of the occasional event, and even more so for the ideology you go with. As it stands, outside what tree you go down it\u2019s really an aesthetic choice that fails to show the workings and weight which that choice would entail, or even the people\u2019s opinion during the time. And with that second thing, it\u2019s no secret that Paradox tends to shy away or even whitewash topics like genocide that takes place in their games, but at the [i]very least[/i] they cannot be neutral on perhaps the most political war in history. In my opinion these are the main reasons why this game\u2019s community tends to be questionable at best, with one of the worst pipelines to fascism (or at the very least romanization) out there. \n\nThe [i]only[/i] reason I would recommend this game is the community mods, as it seems similar to Bethesda they wish more for modders to provide what they will not. Road to 56, Old World Blues, The New Order: Last Days of Europe or Thousand Week Reich, Red Flood, and of course Kiaserreich/Kiaserredux are all great examples of community made mods, that while they do have their own problems, they still surpass the game that they used as a base. Still though, I genuinely would not recommend the base game for even $20, let alone the asking $50 (CAD). But if you like history, and can pick it up for less than $10, I\u2019d actually recommend it.  \n\n[spoiler]Sorry no comments this time around, but I know better than to leave them on here [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1678738711, "timestamp_updated": 1678738828, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134476206": {"recommendationid": "134476206", "author": {"steamid": "76561199083272527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 11215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 217, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1696092031}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love playing uruguay.

game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently downloaded Hearts of Iron IV and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had left. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1672814630, "timestamp_updated": 1672814630,

The game basically introduced far too many interactions and events without questioning whether the underlying logic makes sense. \n\nIn my last game as Germany, I immediately justified and declared on Poland, then the Soviets. Again, nonhistorical to spice things up. As a WWII oriented game, obviously the German-Soviet war should be heavily focused on during development. \n\nIn reality, during my war with the Soviets, they first called in the Czechs, even though they weren't in the same faction and the Czechs weren't communist. Makes total sense, the Soviets are under attack, of course Czechoslovakia would be willing to get crushed to save the Soviets. I deploy troops, and crush the Czechs. But before they capitulated, Austria formed Austria-Hungary and absorbed all of Czechoslovakia. I lose all the land I captured, and am not at war with Austria. Yep, that's totally how Germany would have reacted. I continue pushing against the Soviets, and two Soviet civil wars erupt back-to-back, which were both quenched within a day without any cities being taken. Meanwhile, I lose land that I controlled and some of my troops got encircled. And this called in Sinkiang and Communist China into the war. Big brain move, why didn't people do this during WWII IRL? Would have taken Berlin in a month. Whatever. Then a third soviet civil war erupted, and this time since Japan was at war with communist China, all of the soviets was taken by Japan. Ok, wow. So yeah, millions of lives lost, land conquered, guns fired, and I get, nothing. My war score tanked. Obviously I was at 100% before, but now, without any units stepping on Soviet land or fighting any Soviet troops, the Japanese got 70% war score, and since I can't do anything to finish the rest of the war with China, the Japanese war score is just going to keep rising. \n\nThis does not make sense. I don't care if the devs decide to rework all those minor nations. I care that the rest of the game does not get affected. I just want to be able to go to war without every other nation be like, hmmm, legally you are not allowed to fight anymore. \n\nDon't bother buying anything past Man the Guns.

The large library of mods make you play every scenario, but in my onion the cons often outweigh the pros.\n\nTo give a few examples; the game and especially the launcher are laggy at best and crash when you click some random buttons. Also there is an enormous learning curve of this game. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, wanting to learn something new is good but if I look at myself and my friends, you need to put a good 50 hours in to get the basics of everything ( focus tree effects, creating division templates, government management etc) and add in an extra 100 to get good at it. Having to spend 50 days (say you play 3 hours, everyday) just getting good at a game in my opinion, is a waste of time. Oh and forgot to mention top players have like 2000 hours so good luck with that.\n\nIf, and only if you really like strategy games from paradox, never played real strategy games this is a good test to see if you can withstand the huge grind it is to get good at it. If that's the case, well have at it. on a good sale it's like 10-20 bucks and mods are free. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend. After playing a game you've played at least 2 hours which means you can't even return it because it was not to your liking.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682002561, "timestamp_updated": 1682002561,

I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Most mods require all of the DLC or at least the first couple. I've put many hours and a lot of money into this game. I enjoy it loads, but i don't feel it was worth the money, especially with how lazy the devs are getting with the newest DLCs. (I dont blame the devs themselves, i blame the higher-ups pushing them to release subpar content for a deadline rather than actually letting them flesh out each dlc. \n\nMy recommendation is for the people that already own the game and want to buy all the DLC, get them on sale btw. I can't recommend the game to new players who dont own the game or have never played it. \n\ni have limited experience in multiplayer but it's given me enough insight to say that everyone involved must have super fast connection and god help you if youre playing in different regions. The long 70-day focuses and awful meta game (7-2s and 14-4s are all you see out of randoms) make both diplomacy and wars slow and grindy. in single player you either get rolled by ai or completely curb-stomp them. The balance is completely dead. Make 7-2s, get a half decent tank division, build fighters and cas, and you win the game. \n\nThere exists elements of a strategy game but hardly any implementation. Terrain bonuses either do nothing to affect your decision making or become the sole focus of it. For example, as Italy you would want to defend mountains and hills, this would practically halt any ai army and slow down players significantly. As the USSR you never make a decision like \"Hm i should concentrate more troops in the plains than in the marshes because the plains are harder to defend\". Whether a tile is a mountain or not is the only terrain-related decision that ever matters in the grand scheme of things. There is a poor diversity of infantry units. The player can only make generic Infantry, no jungle, desert, forest, etc Infantry. You can make mountaineers but they count towards your special forces cap instead of being a regular infantry type.

Let's say that it works for you.  Great.  Hope you've got a spare $1000 laying around to play the entire game.  Even Paradox knows their DLC policy is total klept and has started offering subscriptions as an alternative.  That's right, subscriptions for a single-player game.  That's what it has come to.\n\nAnd out of all these DLC, what are the ones that matter?  The ones that let design you own ships, tanks and aircraft of course.  Plural.  Because whilst all these things could have been easily combined into a single DLC that players would actually want and be useful, instead Paradox decided to split all these functions across three different DLCs, thus forcing you to buy all three of them if you want 100% functionality of what is, in essence, a single new feature.  All working as planned.\n\nIf you [i]do[/i] use mods then Ye Gods help you, because [i]every[/i] little patch - and they're almost weekly - will break them all.  Even if it's just a text correction of some typos, somehow it will explode every mod you have.  It's actually impressive, as I thought only Bannerlord was able to do this until now.  Yet as I said at the start, even playing a stock vanilla game I've found it to be as stable as a jar of nitroglycerin on a roller coaster.\n\nAnd despite all of these constant expansions and add-ons, most of these new systems either don't work right, are horribly inbalanced, incomplete or unrealistic.  Why do cavalry need trucks to use the recon unit attachment?  Isn't the whole point of a horse unit that it doesn't need gasoline?  Why is every air wing in every country exactly 100 planes?  Do you know how many nations use 100 as the number of aircraft in a wing in the real world?  None.  Ever.  Are you seriously telling me that entire OSS conssists of three agents?  Rubber is a critical resource but food isn't?  Because I can assure you that starvation was a factor in many a real-world battle in Russia and the Pacific.  Air attacks against naval assets give precise casualty numbers but against ground targets becomes abstracted to the point where the info isn't even accessible.  Single naval battles don't last hours but rather a week or longer.\n\nIf can forgive a lot of funky mechanics in a game like Stellaris because it's science fiction.  HOI, however, is supposed to be based on reality so I'm holding it to a higher standard - and it is failing.

It used to be down to a glitch where so long as they had at least one AT weapon that could kill your best armour it automatically nerfed all your armour.  There appears to be something similar again where divisions operating singly are able to destroy corps.  For example a horse cavalry division with supporting AT company in divisional headquarters could destroy an armoured division as one the dozen AT guns had nerfed the 256 Churchill or Centurion tanks, their mounted infantry out numbered my mech inf and overwhelmed them.\n\nFirst time I played post update the invasion fleet somehow bypassed my fleet and air force before landing invincible horse cavalry that swarmed over the Papuan mountains and overran all defences.  They then sent a tiny corps invaded Darwin and Townsville, wiping out the garrisons, airbases defences and conquered the entire Australian continent making Australia a puppet fascist state with no army but a massive airforce, navy and nuclear weapons that not only weren't able to stop the invaders but along with the army (that just disappeared) suffered almost no casualties while killing the invaders ten to one.\n\nMy second game I carefully prepared my defences, built a massive force to sink the invasion fleet and lost even faster, losing my entire navy and my airforce didn't actually appear to do anything.\n\nI can't be bothered working out what the issue is, I will just not bother playing until I see another update then try it again to see if the balance has been restored.",

The focus trees for major nations and the extensive modding community ensure that every playthrough is a fresh and engaging experience. Want to see what happens when Germany allies with the Soviet Union against the Allies? Go ahead and rewrite history. The possibilities are endless, and every decision you make has far-reaching consequences.\n\nThe sheer scale of the game is mind-boggling. Managing your nation's military, industry, diplomacy, and politics is a complex yet highly rewarding task. The planning and execution of military operations are where Hearts of Iron IV truly shines. The battle plans, troop movements, and strategic decisions you make can turn the tide of a war. The feeling of orchestrating a successful encirclement or pulling off a daring naval invasion is unparalleled in the world of strategy gaming.\n\nThe graphics and presentation are top-notch, with an attention to detail that brings the World War II era to life. The map is beautifully rendered, and watching the borders shift as wars rage on is a visual treat. The sound design, from the thunderous roar of artillery to the patriotic music of each nation, adds another layer of immersion.\n\nMultiplayer is where Hearts of Iron IV truly comes alive. Coordinating with friends or competing against other players in epic multiplayer battles is an experience like no other. The alliances, betrayals, and diplomatic negotiations that unfold in multiplayer matches make for memorable gaming moments that keep me coming back for more.\n\nParadox Interactive's commitment to ongoing development and improvement is commendable. The regular updates and expansions add new layers of depth to an already complex game, ensuring that there is always something new to discover.\n\nIn conclusion, Hearts of Iron IV is a triumph of grand strategy gaming. With its historical accuracy, immersive gameplay, and endless replayability, it has consumed 800 hours of my life and counting. If you have even a passing interest in World War II or grand strategy games, Hearts of Iron IV is a must-play. It's not just a game; it's an epic historical journey that will keep you hooked for hundreds of hours.

years, I just don't think I can recommend this game in its current state. While there are a lot of cool features and it can be very fun at times, and even outside of the more interesting parts it can be relaxing to sit and build up your country while watching world events, there are many fundamental problems that have only been getting worse. For one, the DLC system has made the price to get all of the content increasingly unreasonable (I believe it is approaching 200 dollars at this point) and the devs seem to be more focused on adding more DLC/updates than fixing and integrating previous content with the new or optimizing the game, which has led to increasingly poor performance and many older features starting to break. With the worsening performance, it can take up to 10 hours to play a full game even with a decent CPU, and personally I don't think the enjoyment wrought from a game is enough to warrant playing for that long. There have been many a time where I played a game for 8 hours and eventually met all of my goals, but still walked away feeling like I had wasted half a day and sacrificed a good nights sleep so I could stare at a map instead of doing something actually fun or productive. Another matter, although one the devs have limited control over in all fairness, is the community. While most of the core community, such as those on offical forums and the communities based around larger content creators, are mostly just normal people trying to enjoy a strategy game, you will quickly run into neonazis, tankies, and other extremist nutjobs if you stray from this core, or look a little too closely into the corners of even the aformentioned normal spaces. While this is somewhat of an inevitability with any WW2 game, it seems like there is a higher concentration here, and I swear I've been finding them more and more in previously sane parts of the community. Between the DLC policy, the dropoff in enjoyment (especially considering the timesink it has become, which has negatively impacted my day-to-day life at points), and the increasingly toxic community, I have personally decided to stop playing this game for the time being. If you are looking for a strategy game, you might have some fun if you have a good computer, a few hundred bucks to shell out for the DLC (while technically optional, many a core feature is only avaliable with it), and dont mind having some of your friends look at you questionably while you desperately try to explain you aren't \"one of those\" hoi4 players, but otherwise I would advise against playing this game unless they iron some of the current issues out.", "timestamp_created": 1696033546, "timestamp_updated": 1696033546, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

This game is a rollercoaster of frustration and exasperation, a true exercise in patience and endurance. Yet, somehow, against all odds, I can't help but find myself drawn to its infuriating charm.\n\nLet's start with the positives, shall we? The level of detail in Hearts of Iron IV is mind-boggling, I'll give it that. Paradox Interactive must have a team of historians locked away somewhere, meticulously recreating the events of World War II down to the tiniest of units. The sheer scope of strategic options available is overwhelming, and it's a credit to the game's designers that they've managed to cram so much complexity into the interface.\n\nHowever, complexity doesn't always equate to fun. Hearts of Iron IV often feels like a never-ending struggle against its own mechanics. The micromanagement required to keep your sprawling empire in check is enough to give anyone a headache. I swear, I spend more time fumbling through menus and assigning tasks to divisions than actually enjoying the strategic aspect of the game. And don't even get me started on the AI. It's as if the developers thought, \"Why let players have fun when we can have them fight against an AI that's simultaneously omniscient and utterly clueless?\"\n\nThe graphics? Well, let's just say they won't be winning any awards anytime soon. I get it, this isn't a AAA title, but it's 2023, and the graphics in Hearts of Iron IV look like they were pulled from a history textbook. And don't even think about zooming in too close \u2013 the pixelated mess that greets you is an eyesore of monumental proportions.\n\nBut for all my complaints, here's the twist: I keep coming back to it. There's a certain perverse satisfaction that comes from outsmarting the broken AI, from somehow managing to keep your country afloat despite the barrage of bugs and quirks. Hearts of Iron IV is the kind of game that makes you feel like a tactical genius when things go right, even if they often go right for all the wrong reasons.\n\nSo, would I recommend Hearts of Iron IV? Well, it's a game that defies logic. It's clunky, it's infuriating, and it's undoubtedly one of the most complex strategy games out there. But if you're willing to wade through the muck and mire, there's a twisted kind of satisfaction to be found.

Biggest issue is the fucking terrible supply system they added with No Step Back, making you have to constantly build railroads and supply hubs all the god damn time to the point that you can't build any factories. Can't advance without supply, so you spend so much of your time micromanaging everything. They should've stuck to the old supply system, or better yet, do what the Total War games do for supplies. I tried to learn this game multiple times, but there's just too much shit going on, and all that happens is you can't enjoy the game and just end up getting pissed off along with wasting hours of your time trying to play unsuccessfully.

In battles, I struggle to understand what is going on.  Where do I have air superiority, and where does the enemy?  What naval waters do I control, which ones are contested?  What naval waters do I have the upper hand and where does the enemy?

The gameplay is similar, but the army is a lot more complicated. Like most Paradox games, this one takes a bunch of tries to figure out what you're doing, but overall I found it pretty manageable to get into once I stopped beating my head against a wall. \n\nWhat gets this game a negative from me is how much of the non-combat interactions are purely RNG. The reliance on chance to determine events means that things that logically should happen over the course of interactions with the AI may just never happen.\n\nIn two separate games, I pushed my neighbors to 65-70% ideological similarity to me and destabilized their governments to prompt a peaceful change of power. Despite maintaining 20-30% stability in the nations for more than a year, improving my relations with them, and having a significantly larger army/more infrastructure, neither flipped to my ideology. Instead, after about 18 months, one of the two flipped to a democratic majority (I assume some focus that boosted the faction), reducing my ideology by 30% in the process. \n\nTo me, this game feels like Paradox got so caught up in making sure that players couldn't find easy and predictable ways to win that they completely removed any predictability from everything but combat.

Again, its a chore, players say its only bad in China or South America or whatever but its not that at all, its bad everywhere no matter what. Wanna play the Soviet Union? or maybe China? well good luck with that because if your the soviet union you have to spend around half a year ingame to actually make it suitable to have troops on the front line without them starving. Fuck man, even when your troops are ON the rail way they STILL find a way to starve. How about China? Whats that? you pushed Japan out and are about to start your invasion of Manchuria? Yeah good luck with that, because the supply is so bad you have to spend, and i shit you not, around a FULL INGAME YEAR to build the supply good enough to continue your advance.

At this point i feel as if ive been stolen from because of bait and switch. The game has had years of game breaking mechanics that allow the AI to cheat and ruin the game.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n8/1/23 Same sh1t different update. Tanks can no longer handle a single infantry unit.\nMine 9 divisions (4 Light, 2 med, 4 truck, support: scout truck, entrenchment, hospital, logistics)\nAI 1 division(9 infantry, support: 1 artillery 1 entrenchment)\n\nevery terrain, every width, attack or defense mine lose. Its absolute BS. Paradox are nothing but thieves.\n\n\n1/8/23 Somehow Britain moved an invasion to Konigsberg through Denmark Straights I had 68% control of, not possible if you are a player. 2 fleets never once caught or fought any of the invasion fleet or reinforcements sent through that sea.\n1 Brit tank division with less everything than my Tank Divs. Held off 8 Infantry and 9 tank divisions attacking from 6 tiles, for over a week.\nThese two points ruined a game and cost me the win, because I was flanked by a naval invasion that broke the Games mechanics. Britain, Canada, India, Australia, South Africa, Poland, Lithuania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia Vs Germany, Romania, & Hungary.\n\n1/7/23 FFS FIX ITALY!!! Same exact unit, better supply and organization levels, on plains, better general, air support, and tanks in the mix. AND I STILL FUC**** LOSE 10 UNITS VS 5 ATTACKING FROM 2 TILES TO 1.\n\n12/22 Update** Italy is still broken.\n\nUnit templates are identical between Germany and Italy.\nMy defending troops; 100% entrenched, supplied, and 3to1. Italian troops will push them aside.\nMy attacking troops facing; un-entrenched troops 12to3, cannot break through with identical stats and numerical superiority while attacking from 3 tiles to 1. Italian infantry(3Kph) can walk faster than Panzer(14Kph) units to fill breakthroughs in all terrain.\n\nItaly as your ally will start extra wars you can't numerically handle and then get steam rolled by that nation, or will attack you as germany and be invincible or if you do jump italy before their ready it will do the below complaints where you don't really get to keep italy and have to attack italy 3 times before its subdued.\n\n\n\nThis game is a scam do not waste your money on it, because they will also change the game and ruin the original product you bought. It is bait & Switch.\n\n\nUpdate** I want to love this game so much, but I just had another game ruined by Regina del sud. I am so F*cking tired of ending up in a war with Italy, winning only to be forced to have a two piece sh*t @ss nation like regina del sud suddenly be my puppet, without me approving it or having any choice in them joining the axis, and making me subjugate them every F*cking time.\n\nStill losing research boosts to Germany every time i play, there are 3-4 boosts to rushing tanks you should get. I only ever get 2 now when rushing tanks.\n\n_______\n\n\nThe game is now completely un-playable. It has been broken for 3 years of which i took a hiatus. I wish i had never bought it and could get a refund. This game is no longer what I purchased and I can't uninstall the new trash updates and get the old game back. So basically I have been swindled out of my money as I can't even play the original game I bought.\n\nConquered territories & people can now become puppet nations and join your faction and you have no say in the matter. You will have to re-attack them and take them over again. Even if you had attacked them with the goal of Annexation. You will just immediately lose control of the Factories, resources, and more importantly the Man power. \n\nIn 3/3 games where I have gone to war with Italy as Germany. After taking Rome, Italy Ousts Mussolini and joins the Axis as Ragina Del Sud(name is a meme sue me), you cannot conquer the territory Ragina has or gets as you continue fighting Italy. You then have to struggle to subjugate them with supplies you have built until they are not a puppet, while you are probably at war with Britain & Russia at this point.\n\nWhen you attack a territory all troops in it are in battle and can't move out, unless the AI want to break the game mechanics which it will do every single game. I have watched Russia and France move units through a tile that is being attacked into an undefended tile faster than my troops can move into that tile that they just fought to take.

This game took me by storm, I am new to PC gaming and only recently (2020) was able to play games on a PC, I was able to download this game online but never had access to WiFi so played offline and with barely any DLC, but I loved it! I still love it now, HOI4 is one of my favourite games of all time and honestly for someone who enjoys strategy games as well as honestly having a puzzling personality but overall loving a challenge I couldn't be more infatuated with this game Easy to play and get use too! complex but not as complex as other games.\n\nHowever the downsides are:\nEverything is behind a pay wall, I'm quite poor but now am a student at uni and can afford more but it really gets ridiculous most beginning DLCs are features that should be in the game and not have to pay 15 pound for... (although you can wait for sales where it will decrease in price.)\nsometimes the RNG sucks, and you feel like you're constantly getting fucked over by the AI either as a teammate in a faction or fighting them.\nSometimes you'll end up fighting stupid proxy wars\nAgain with paying for packs (allied armor, radio ect) it's really bad, it's as bad as CSGO loot cases or the new overwatch system.\nCommunity is full of toxic kids, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer, if you're new you get made fun of, if you make a mistake someone will be a dick to you. I have met some of the worst human beings playing this game. You will be made fun of for everything and anything. I spelt 1 word wrong (I have dyslexia, ASD {Autism Spectrum Disorder} and dyspraxia) and they made fun of that, calling me a retard ect. Not nice or mature at all, I shouldn't had let it get to me, but being called that while disabled isn't great.\nAchievements are a heavy GRIND and normally result in world wars. (Which makes them take HOURS to complete) - They are still challenging which is great! but still a bit grindy\n\nOverall I love HOI4, the paywalll if awful, the people are awful, the AI can be awful. But there's poetic justice when you manage to win a war by the grit of your teeth, or your spies are able to get you a puppet, or like when I tried to do D-day and got all the way into Frankfurt! The game is fun! And there's always more to do! I would recommend to either buy on CD-keys, Or wait for a sale, buying this game full price or any of the DLCs full price is a scam.", "timestamp_created": 1665443839, "timestamp_updated": 1665443839,

decided to go with Luxembourg, since hey, might as well try something hard right?\nI spent meny years improving my nation's industry and infrastructure. After building up I thought it'd be nice to have some friends and wanted to buddy up with the mighty UK. They didn't want me in, thinking I'm too weak and pathetic. Then it all began. I swore vengeance on those damn imperialist. I began to plot my revenge. I hired a fascist demagogue to change my ideology while rushing nuclear research despite the massive penalties. After a succesful coup, or as it will be known in Luxembourgian history - unification of my people under one banner I joined the Axis since both Germany and me had mutual enemies. With their help I was able to unite the Benelux region under my rule, gaining more precious factories and people to force into my legions. I helped the mighty Reich in conquest of France, being rewarded with another small chunk of land. Everything was going according to my plan. But then a certain Austrian thought it'd be smart to attack the USSR. At first everything was fine, but then, oh god... Then the blasted British landed troops in France. So here I was facing the hordes of imperialist pigs while my best pal was off in Russia causing havoc. But I knew what I had to do. I had to stall them as long as  possible, and that I did. Eventually Italaians and few Germans came to help and the British advance was slowed down or even halted at times. Good, good, just a bit more time. I'll show those islanders how \"weak and pathetic\" I am. I'll show them. In late 1944 the first nuclear bomb was produced. But I couldn't drop it without air superiority, so I waited and built up more airforce to help the Germans win the air war in the regions. And the help I provided proved very significant, the might Luxembourgian air force dominated the skies and allowed me to drop my revenge. Oh what a wonderful sight it was to see London in ruins.

Major nations should no longer be out of fighters in the first month of the war.\n\n4: Balancing certain air missions seems to be off: This was largely fixed. I still think Strategic bombing is a waste of time - mostly because the upfront investment to even build strategic bombers is just too high (see my new criticisms below)\n\n5: Naval stacking doesn't seem to cause a penalty: Penalties have been added, so it no longer makes sense to just have one doomfleet.\n\nI stand by my original claim that these are balancing tweaks and they have been largely tweaked away.\n\nI also identified that there was a problem with fuel not being treated as a consumable resource which removed many of the historical pressures and reasons why nations acted like they did. This was fixed by Paradox some time ago, and fuel is now a very real pressure for Germany and Japan as it was historically.\n\nHowever, there are now some new and slightly annoying balancing tweaks which I'd like to see addressed:\n\n1. There are too many research options and too few slots/research takes too long. As it currently is, they've added so many things to research, many of them very cool, but there's no way to research them without totally hobbling yourself. For example, historically the UK managed to keep on top of basically all sorts of aircraft designs, ship designs, medium, light and heavy tank designs (plus associated TDs), infantry equipment designs, and various secret projects like RADAR and nuclear weapons. In game there just isn't the capacity to do this. You're likely going  to likely only research one type of tank (light then medium), one type of bomber (probably CAS or TAC), and probably fall behind on capital ships, due to the lack of research capacity. I have so far never bothered to even research scout planes because it feels like the research slot is always better deployed on something (anything) else. I think there should be some more ways to specialise national research. In HOI 3 this was through the research organisations giving particular bonuses. I think this should make a comeback via the 'concerns' in the politics menu - these already offer some bonuses in some cases but I think this should be extended greatly. I also think they should be easier to appoint earlier so that you can specialise earlier. Perhaps appointing your first concern for an area should be cheaper, but changing later more expensive.\n\n2. Similarly, production even for very industrial nations like Germany doesn't feel strong enough to keep up with all the options. This obviously needs to be a limiting factor as it was historically but usually it just doesn't make sense to build any of the more esoteric units, e.g. swimming tanks, or self-propelled rocket artillery, because throwing factories at infantry equipment is *so much more important*. This leads to most nations playing the same - build infantry equipment, support equipment, trucks, artillery, fighters, CAS, medium tanks. Deviation is a great way to run out of equipment and lose the war. Obviously these pressures are key to how the game works, but it feels like there needs to be some sort of system to encourage diversification. Perhaps for example, factories could be more nuanced than 'military' or 'civilian' - a light arms factory is very different from a car factory. Perhaps a car factory could be re-purposed to produce vehicles but not guns.\n\n\nI still think the mechanics are the best they've ever been. In comparison to HOI3 it's a far more streamlined experience, and managing your forces is so much easier. No more screwing around with endless levels of military hierarchy and hundreds and hundreds of generals who all become interchangeable anyway. Here there are only four levels - division, army, group and theatre - and you assign generals to armies and Field Marshalls to Groups. Similarly, while in HOI3 manageing your airforce was such an enormous pain, and the effects of air superiority so minor that it basically was not worth it, here air power is much much easier to control and project and will be central to your overall strategy. Navies have also had a makeover although I haven't yet played any major sea power so won't comment on their effectiveness.\n\nThere's also an entirely new production system which is 1: vastly superior and 2: makes a lot more sense. Whereas previously you \"built\" divisions, here each division requires particular equipment dictated by its design as well as time to train. In terms of equipment they need guns, supplies, artillery, anti-tank guns, and particular vehicles, all of which need to be produced by your production lines which you set up and control. The way that this equipment is then handled means that upgrades are simulated much more realistically. In HOI3 a brigade used the previous technology until 100% upgraded, and this made no sense: your Panzer 3s had little percentage meters which when filled magiced them into Panzer 4s, your infantry used 1936 weapons until *every single 1938 weapon they needed arrived* then switched. Here divisions use whatever they can get from the stockpile, meaning that your divisions take delivery of new equipment as it arrives and replace losses with whatever you have available. So for example if your tank production doesn't keep up, your panzer divisions will fill the missing slots with whatever old crap was sitting in the depot. Oh and about that time to train - if the Motherland needs divisions comrade, you can simply hand them a rifle from the pile and point them at the Germans...\n\nFinally the AI is better in several respects. For example it is far better at naval invasions now (in fact, it's a bit too keen on them) so Britain doesn't sit around uselessly unless player controlled. It's also much better at manageing forces and maintaining a front line so it's not so prone to huge encirclements. It seems to handle terrain better too, and pick good places to push and excellent defensive positions (which can grind things to a halt). It also seems to be a lot less predictable and capable of pulling off some rather complicated plans - I saw, for example, Japan launch an enormous pincer maneuvre on China, invading from both the North and South and cutting the country in half, trapping most of the Chinese forces out of supply. It's had some problems in the past with over-committing on low priority fronts but it seems to have improved in this regard in recent patches.\n\nOverall this is, in my opinion, *the* WW2 grand strategy game.

The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.", "timestamp_created": 1549125268, "timestamp_updated": 1549125268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 321, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.945397913455963135", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79533757": {"recommendationid": "79533757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011814232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 65929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47143, "last_played": 1693610349}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Every nationalist is haunted by the belief that the past can be altered.

I loaded into the game, chose my nation, and started playing, except I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked Samuel for help, and he hosted a multiplayer match so that I could join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since his mother passed away due to C-19. Hearts of Iron IV has since then, brought me and my adolescent son closer again, to the point he's found the enthusiasm to join me for fishing trips to our local lake. This purchase, albeit perhaps insignificant to some, has reminded me how there is fun to be had in video games despite my age.

The AI is a bit dumb, and will regularly leave it's front undefended, and when fighting alongside you, will never move thier units into a coherent fighting force. I played France in my own alliance, and after wiping Germany and the rest of the Axis, we warred with the Soviets, with America joining in. America kept most of it's units off the front, forcing my military to bear the brunt of a full soviet assault, which was very taxing on my manpower. Eventually won, but I'll be damned if America didn't have 10x my unit count, with most of them in my territory, and only about 10 divisions on the front. On the other hand, I find it fun. It's fun designing units, and devising strategies, and picking the right time to strike, and the right things to build at the right time. \n\nThat aside, Paradox has been very poor in it's decision making for the DLCs. The most recent, death or dishonor, honestly should've been a patch. They do the same thing for Stellaris, where MAJOR GAME CHANGES are kept behind a paywall. But, if Paradox pulls it's head out of it's butt, like many companies are doing slowly, than this may be one of the best grand strategy games ever. So I do recomend.  Just expect to pay about $70 for the final product.\n\nEDIT: The cornflakes free update has fixed many of the AI problems that where present. it still isn't the best at making intelligent decisions (such as communist China going to war with China AND Manchukuo after Japan had a civil war and went democratic), but it can at least wage war now.

If you're one of those people quickly scrolling through to get a general idea of wether or not you should buy, I reccomend it. If you want a more informed opinion, feel free to keep reading. \n\nOVERVIEW:\nHearts of Iron IV is a \"Grand Stratagy\" game set during the turmoil of the 1930's/40's and the Second World War. You can command any nation around the world and lead it on to the world stage and on to glory. You must choose wether or not to begin playing in either 1936 or 1939. The former allows for a more custom setup and is better for playing small nations. If you're trigger-happy and eager to send millions of young men to their deaths, you can choose 1939, grab your gun and leap into the fray. No matter which country you command, you can customize it to your liking. You can change their ideology, strengthen their economy, and lead them to dominate the earth! You can create a fascist Finland, a communist Australia, or a democratic Venezuela (good luck with that one). You also have complete control over all armed forces of your nation, and you can practically do anything with them! If you wish to send hordes of unarmed men at the enemy's machine guns and trenches, you go right ahead. Now this game has many in's and out's that I could go on for hours about, but most of those things are easy to understand, and the internet exists for a reason! However, I will offer some advice to new players. \n\nADVICE TO THE PLEBS: \nGood first-playthrough countries are Italy, Germany, the Soviet Union, or the United States. \n\nOnly make trade deals if you have no other choice-don't give away all your factories!\n\nRemember to change the conscription laws when you are at war! You can do this by clickling on your country's flag and clicking on the conscription icon. \"Quantity has a quality of it's own\" -Joseph Stalin\n\nKeep your fleets in port until you want to launch a naval invasion, then unleash them on the part of the sea you need to control in order to send transports through. By then your fleets should be large enough to hold off the enemy. This is especially true for Germany. The moment you send your fleet out, the entire Royal Navy will drop by for target practice and sink all of your ships. I know because it's happened to me. \n\nConvoy Raiding is, admittedly, a joke in this game and it's not worth losing all of your submarines for. \n\nAlways make frontlines with your armies. Don't just deploy your men willy nilly, otherwise the enemy will break through quickly.\n\nIf you're the impatient sort and playing with a country that has a lot of resources, I reccomend the Mobile Warfare doctrine with some lovely Medium Tank divisions. Those guys can always win a war quickly. \n\nDon't try to research everything.\n\nIf you plan on conquering a lot, research Military Police early on and assign them with cavalry, and put them on conquered states. You'll thank me later.\n\nNow then, let's go over the overall pros and cons!\nPROS and CONS\n+Endless replayability \n+Few restrictions on gameplay\n+Land Warfare is (for the most part) simple enough to understand\n+Division customization allows for custom armies\n+The music is excellent\n+Lots of opportunity for customization and creativity\n+Fantastic modding community- Mods add hundreds more hours of playtime\n+Mods and add pretty much anything you want into the game (Unit models, Music, ect.)\n+You don't need any DLC for most mods, unlike other Paradox games\n+Multiplayer is a good time\n\n-Not enough natural resources, really annoying\n-Naval combat is very hard to understand unless you're playing as Great Britain\n-Naval combat is missing historical elements. It'll probably be fixed with a DLC, knowing Paradox\n-The AI isn't perfect and can make some horrific strategic moves\n-No coordination with ally AI on military stratagey\n-Aerial combat, in it's current state, is simply throwing planes into the sky and seeing which side has more of them\n-The treaty system has a lot of issues, but these can be fixed by the Player-Led Treaty mod and the State-Transfer mod\n\nBEST PRO: The glorious feeling you get when you crush your enemies! Leading a country through WWII to victory is very satisfying and I believe the game has accomplished it's goal of bringing the grand strategy of the war into the player's control.\nWORST CON: During the late game, most countries will have created hundreds of divisions. While this doesn't affect me that badly, it can cause a tremendous amount of lag and I've heard from several people that it has made their late-game saves unplayable. Paradox (or some modder) needs to implement a system in which the AI lessens the amount of divisions it has when it is at peace.\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10 \nThough the game has it's faults and some aspects of it are difficult to understand, Hearts of Iron IV allows the player a thoroughly enjoyable experience for those who enjoy both History and Grand Stratagy. Now if you don't mind, I must return to my command tank and finish the conquest of Europe. Soon the entire world will tremble before the might of the fatherland!

It's... an interesting experience, to say the least, there's certainly not many other games like it that I know of. \n\nYou want a TL:DR at the start? Sure, I can recommend this game, but that's with a very bit asterisk next to it.\n\nTo start with the pros, its definitely a very enjoyable game in the early stages of any match; the feeling of evaluating what you have to work with and then building up slowly in power, or starting off at a breakneck speed for some countries is spot on. The graphics, though a little rough at points are really great overall and do a wonderful job of conveying everything to the player. The menus, controls and UI, though complicated at first, are quick and efficient once you get them down. The sheer amount of variety in terms of playable countries (That is literally all of them) is also a big plus. Even though countries like Bhutan, Tibet or Nicaragua are dull as dirt once the novelty wears off, the sheer fact that the option is there is definitely commendable, as is the amount of branching and varied paths for each of the countries with a focus tree.\n\nWith that said, however, the game has plenty of flaws, foremost among them being the AI. It will either be the most formidable and downright unfairly impossible opponent to ever walk the Earth, or it will put up the resistance of a wet packet of spaghetti, and very rarely any level between that. Italy and the USSR are sorely lacking their updated focus trees, and whilst they are likely to come in a future DLC that doesn't change how dull they are to play currently unless you specifically want to play as Mussolini or Stalin, and whilst Italy tends to scrape by because of it's annoying navy and colonies, the USSR is almost a pushover at this point. Stalin can't ever seem to hold his territory and only ever seems to succeed when he's beating up countries twenty times smaller than his, and even then that's not a 100% for him. This makes trying to play any historical game a nightmare because he Nazi's, or just Germany in general are so absurdly powerful that they'll just steamroll the USSR without allowing for a truly historical game. Speaking of Germany, the fact that I never really set the AI to the fascist path anymore speaks to how annoyingly powerful they are; it's genuinely a disheartening time trying to have fun only to get run over by Germany's 600 suspiciously perfectly equipped divisions and 5,000 fighter planes (Not exaggerated numbers by any stretch) and then to end WW2 in an endless face-off between them and the Brits because the devs never programmed the German AI to know what a naval invasion is. The point of this is that often the AI becomes a roadblock to the player's fun, rather than a challenging opponent; Your allies sometimes become more of a pain than an comrade as their priorities are so messed up and incomprehensible that often you can find yourself thanking the random horde of Greek or Swedish troops holding your borders whilst wondering why the British abandoned Africa to the Italians, or the French leaving twelve guys, a box of wine and a cheese wheel to fend off seventy Italian divisions barrelling across the Alpes. \n\nAnd then there's the DLC. Overall, have they greatly improved the gameplay and made things more immersive? Definitely. Should these parts of the game have been cut out and then sold back to you for an added fee? Hell no. Sure, one can argue that these were aspects the devs needed extra time to implement, or that they only thought of them later on, but that does not justify that in order to play Hearts of Iron 4 in any meaningful capacity beyond a basic WW2 sim, which by this point is one of the worse aspects of the game, you need to essentially pay for the game all over again and then some, which is just not acceptable to me.\n\n\nSo yes, overall I can say I can recommend this game for those who want a political or military wargame set in the 1930s and 40s, and who want to try interesting, unique or just plain silly alternate history options. But be very aware that the game only has so much content before you need to start relying on messing around with friends to keep it interesting, and make sure you're willing to buy at least some of the DLC, because otherwise you're not going to have much of a game to play.\nOverall, a fairly solid 7/10 from me; a game whose pros are that it offers a unique wargaming situation in one of the most turbulent times in recent history, with plenty of interesting gameplay options and little intricacies even I'm still discovering, but whose cons are a predatory DLC system scooping out gameplay aspects to be sold back to the player and an AI who reaches Rome Total War 2 levels of bad more often than I would like to admit.\nA true TL:DR?

But when the German soldiers went to their \"newly aquired lands\" they saw forts, bunkers and all sorts of fortifications along the border, with Czechoslovakian flags held high. See, the Czechs had a fear of this crisis since 1936, and they acted on it. They build great land forts, built the army, worked on moving to a full war economy and mass produced weapons. The Czechs were ready to defend their rightful home. 2 months will pass and the German Reich will demand that Czechoslovakia surrender the land or there will be war... The Czech president sent a message to the German aggressors, \"Come and take it\", at that moment, In 1938, the German Reich decalred war on the Czechs. No help from the U.K. or France made the situation look dire, but the brave Czechs had a plan, they reformed the \"Little Enente\" of Yugoslovia and Romania. Hungary, bordering the east of Czechslovakia would go onto join the Axis, and try to invade Slovakia, but Romanian troops will crush the Hungarian menace, and absorb their lands. Its now 1939 and Italy has not decided to enter the war, and Romanian and Yugoslavian troops occupied by fighting to defend Yugoslavia from German invasions, was unable to help the Czechs against Germany, Czechoslovakia stood alone. They saw the German army, the Panzers, the Luffwaffe, and decided that they must hold the line. Winter, 1939 German troops are suffering heavy from attrition, the Czechs have been prepared for winter and have plenty of equipment to hold, then, on December 17, 1939, the Field Marshall of the Czecholslovakian Army ordered a push to attack the encamped Germany attackers. The Czechs raided out of their bunkers and attacked the unprepared Germany army. The Germans were rapidly pushed back, Almost no rest for the retreating German army made them weak. January 12, 1940 -- The capital of the former nation Austria, Vienna, has been taken by Czech forces, the same will be with Nuremberg, Munich. March 11, All of former Austria has been taken by Czech forces, and the entire southern half of Germany has been taken. March 13, The Soviet Union will inavde Poland, and begin to justify war against the Czechoslovakian goverment. In March 27, 1940, the capital of the German Reich, Berlin, will fall to Czech forces, Germany is contemplating surrender. A day later, March 28th, Italy will decide it cannont stand idely by while their ally is being demolished, they declare war on Czechoslovakia. Italy will launch a full invasion on Yugoslavia, in April, Yugoslavia will capitulate to the Italians. Every bit of Germany has been taken except the city of Hamburg, the last bastion of the Nazi goverement. In September of 1940, the German Reich will capitulate to Czech troops. Italy stands alone against the Czech might, A massive army pushed down the Italian pennisula and in December of 1940, Rome will fall. In Early 1941, Italy will surrender to Czech forces, and will be left with control only over Sicily and Sardina, effectively kicked off mainland Europe. In March of 1941, Japan will enter the war and attempt to restore the GErman Reich, their invasion will be stopped. In May, 1941, Japan will give up on the war and ask for peace. The Allies are fighting against Comintern forces while the Czechs consolidate their newly aquired land of Germany, Austria and Italy... and remember the day that when their freedom was in danger, they fought, fought valiantly for it, and won.\n\nThe course of human history was changed that day, WW2 never occured, America and the Allies will fight and destory the Soviet Union in late 1944, the Cold War will never happen, and Czechoslovakia will become one of the most powerful nations in the world.

Just like so many other Paradox global strategies, you take control of the one particular state (which can be as big as Soviet Union/USA or as small as Luxemburg). You're making calls with industry, technologies and infernal politics, preparing for the grand war, which is so close. And then you must fight. Even if you choose some state on the outskirts of the world, like New Zealand or Haiti - it doesn't mean you'll evade the global skirmish. You'll be bored all the way - but eventually, the war will come to you as well.\n\nI have an ambivalent opinion of HoI 4 and don't recommend it as an instant buy. Maybe Paradox will patch some questionable features sometimes... But maybe they'll just make the next, better game. Or they'll make the next HoI even worse, who knows? Yeah, sure, it developed a lot in little details since the 1.0 up to 1.4 version, I can easily agree with that. But, some things, are not too right in the very basic concept.\n\nThe most noticeable pro point of the 4th volume (above the 3rd HoI) is an aeons more acceptable interface and tutorial. The game's mechanics are still very complicated, but, at least, you can learn it without your head boiling too hot. However, there is a catch: once you'll learn \"the better way\" for every country, it's really not fun to play it again. The limit of replayability is still quite high - but it's countable. It's good for game sellers, so they can sell the next almost-similar game faster (the Call-of-Duty syndrome). But it certainly lowers the overall score of the one particular game for me.\n\nWhat is worse, while basically, every country has at least 3 different ways to go, Democratic, Socialistic or Fascist, it's obvious that for the most cases, the Fascist way benefits the player much more. \"C'mon, game, make me a Fascist! Faster!\" - that's a common phrase among Youtube letsplayers. Some may argue, like, would Paradox make it another way - the Axis would be loosing way too often. Maybe. But look at the achievements. There is one, \"NewWorldOrder\", make all the world brown, but why there aren't such trophies for Blue and Red sides? Well, it's not a secret that the dev's are favouring Hitler - maybe not as a person, but as a political figure... But, even in the 3rd Hearts of Iron, where Adolf get a cameo in so-called \"tutorial\", it wasn't so one-way oriented.\n\nTurning fascist as a key strategy to win the war is only one minus point. The much more severe case is all diplomatics in general. First, there are political blocks. And if you're, say, choosing Allies, you can't then skip to the Comintern or Axis during the war. And even if both Allies and Comintern are fighting Axis together, like as in known history, they are still not counting as allies between each other. Next, even worse, is about running some of those blocks yourself. Example - an achievement for Mexico, to land onto Europe, either not allied with anybody, or having the alliance only with South America countries. For Mexico, it's crucial to make at least small alliance - without it, you can't open the 5th research slot, therefore, you'll be losing the tech race. So I made a fine alliance with Colombia, conquered the USA (for another Mexico achievement) and started preparations for the invasion on Europe. All goes well until Germany and Italy both lose. Then, all the small states, which were associated with Axis, suddenly landed in my faction, without even asking! Just because of some game rule, it can sometimes apply or disengage some countries in your alliance. And You - Don't. I understand it was made not to ruin some multiplayer games, but now it certainly ruins single-play.\n\nNext, the wars. At first, they seem much clever than in the 2nd and 3rd HoI - you can issue your generals some master plan, and they will be pursuing it by themselves - which especially cool, if you have multiple wars or fronts simultaneously. But then you notice that every war where you move troops yourself proceeds much faster and better than leaving it to AI. So, no, the micromanagement is still a must, for almost every operation. You have to move your troops yourself, and you always need to observe all your territories, or enemies will make an invasion far in your safe zone and conquer your capital city, while your main forces will be very far away, like in Africa or India... AI battleplan logic, even based on the stats unknown to a player (like the size of fortifications, for the most obvious example) - still lose too many manpower in every war, every single battle, with constant zerg rushes and zeroed organization stat. Remember human waves cliche? Well, it's the most obvious tactic for the AI, not for Russia or China, but for every country.\n\nMore to it! By some strange logic, if your forces are attacking from the territory of another state, the game counts them as the forces of that state. Like if Soviets goes through neutral Poland straight to Berlin, the game greets brave Poles for Their success! And if you conquer some distant land like Australia, you can't be sure, that the game counts that victory to you. In my case, another (allied) nation landed in another part of that continent, haven't got at least one city - but was awarded as a whole winner when I took Canberra.\n\nOr, another case, back to weird diplomacy. The civil war started in Norway, Sweden, and Afganistan. One side marked as Axis, other as Comintern, the game merged all civil wars together with some other conflicts, basically, the World War has started. I, as the Soviet Union, with help from Finland, took the northern parts of Norway and Sweden, and all was going well, I was so close to their capitals when Soviet Afganistan have lost its domestic war. Right away, the game makes some automatic treaty and counts all three civil wars as closed, and Axis forces as winners. All the northern parts of Sweden and Norway now belongs to Axis and all the local forces that were on the Soviet side, now our enemies. Just because the game says so. Yeah, very logical, very realistic.\n\nI can proceed with examples, but they will take us too long. Aviation and artillery cases still far from perfect, and instead of fixing it, Paradox in ver. 1.4 killed the fleet strategies as well... Even the sound options menu is still far from perfect, as it counts some random and totally irrelevant background sounds like shooting and howling of planes on fly-by as \"effect\" and not \"ambient\". And if you don't want to hear all those stupid \"wruum, bah-bah\" all the way, but want to hear sounds when clicking buttons - sorry! It's the 1+1 type of deal! Take the good with the bad, or leave it be!\n\nJust like that, there are too many sides of this really good and complex game, which don't feel alright. Let's finish there, with a quick summary. Is the game better than the 2nd or 3rd Hearts of Iron? With visuals and lower entry level, with the better aid of modders straight from the Steam Community - Yes, naturally.\n\nYou'll still need to learn many things there to operate successfully. But once you'll manage that learning curve (about 30-100 hours average) - you'll start to lose your interest, as it's all not that random, as with Civilization games, and not that logically and historically correct, as previous Paradox games. On the other hand, those questionable game decisions made multiplayer much more acceptable, in general gaming sense. As a solo player, I can't really agree with that turn of the tide. With all disadvantages from diplomacy and other game mechanics, I can't value it higher than 7/10. Buy it at your own risk. There are no such limitations as with previous games like you've might hear, \"play it only if you're good enough with Europa Universalis\" or so, but, if you're wasn't daydreaming on history and logic classes, the 4th HoI still leaving too much to wish for sweeten the taste.", "timestamp_created": 1510701900, "timestamp_updated": 1530361462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 191, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884698331356048584", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90030279": {"recommendationid": "90030279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007338817", "num_games_owned": 601, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 10663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6229, "last_played": 1663713701}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me 90 hours to figure out how to play HoI4 because the battle/war system and army mechanics was confusing for my wee little pea brain lol. \n\nBut decided to try some mods, found one that actually liked a lot, started in a civil war and finally figured out the battle/army mechanics.
