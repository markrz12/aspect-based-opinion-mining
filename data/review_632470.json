Because I believe that ZAUM has worked to make this intentionally muddled when it's honestly as clear cut as can be. Keep in mind that I am more than a little biased and please tell me if I get anything wrong or leave out important details so I can correct them.\n\nIt started in October of 2022 when Martin Luiga made a medium post(1) saying the ZAUM cultural association had dissolved. This association is where the ZAUM company was born from, and in that article he makes it clear that neither he, Robert Kurvitz (Lead Writer), Aleksander Rostov (Lead Artist), and Helen Hindpere (writer) are working at ZAUM, and implies they left unwillingly. The next day the claim that they no longer work there is followed up with confirmation by Rostov(2). As of that point in the timeline this was the only statement ZAUM had made on the matter(3). People weren't happy.\n\nRostov makes his own comprehensive statement on Medium(4), giving everyone more detail on the situation. The current majority shareholder and investors of ZAUM fired them unfairly. They believe that they were being intentionally shut out once their old majority shareholder was bought out, as they had begun to get excluded from daily company operations. What's important is Rostov and Kurvitz believe that the two new majority shareholders in ZAUM, Ilmar Kompus and T\u00f5nis Haavel, had obtained their majority share illegally. They did this by buying a majority stake with ZAUM\u2019s own funds, which surprise surprise, is illegal. Kurvitz and Rostov claimed they were fired after asking for financial documents.\n\nIn response, ZAUM claimed that actually Kurvitz and Rostov and Hindpere were all fired for misconduct. Specifically, they were fired for(5):\n\n\u25cf Limited to no engagement in their responsibilities and work \u2013 including not working at all for almost two years while still being paid by the studio \u2013 and forcing colleagues to compensate for their lack of effort.\n\n\u25cf Creating a toxic work environment that is antithetical to the ZA/UM culture and team productivity.\n\n\u25cf Misconduct in interacting with other colleagues that includes verbal abuse and gender discrimination.\n\n\u25cf Attempts to illegally sell to other gaming companies ZA/UM\u2019s intellectual property with the aim of undermining the rest of the team.\n\nObviously they deny all of these claims, but you should read the whole article on this one, it's so clear that they're lying it's almost funny. Rostov and Kurvitz made it clear they are intending to pursue legal action for both the fraud and the unfair termination.\n\nThis is where things get confusing and most fans fall off, I believe this is a result of Kurvitz and Rostov\u2019s general lack of communication with the public due to ongoing litigation combined with ZAUM\u2019s lame attempts to spin the story in their direction.\n\nKarl Kender, who also left ZAUM in August, had filed a suit against Kompus specifically, stating that he believed they cheated him out of millions(6). This was quickly withdrawn, however with the withdrawn lawsuit, Kompus and Haavel quietly repaid 5.1 million dollars to ZAUM (not admitting that they stole it). This left us all confused as we didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening in regards to Kurvitz\u2019s game.\n\nThis exchange was the last real information we got until Tuesday, in which ZAUM suddenly released a statement saying that it was all over. Kender had repaid all the debts he owed to the company (while never directly admitting he stole them). This left everyone in a weird limbo, as we had no idea what would happen from here. All we knew was that Kurvitz\u2019s suit was still ongoing.\n\nWe get no word until this Tuesday, March 14. ZAUM out of the blue claims that everything is now resolved(7). They said that the unfair termination suit by Kurvitz and Rostov was dropped due to lack of evidence, and that Kompus had paid the money back in full, and Kender had paid Kompus for all legal fees for his withdrawn suit back in December, resolving the situation.\n\nIt\u2019s important here to talk about the news cycle. It\u2019s generally important to a company that searching their name on google doesn't bring up hundreds of articles about how fraudulent they are, so for a few days, searches of their name were good for the first time. \u201cDisco Elysium suit resolved, situation over\u201d\n\nThis lasted all of two days, because yesterday on March 16th, Kurvitz and Rostov responded to that claim(8), saying that no they had not withdrawn the suit, and returning stolen money doesn\u2019t fix anything, since he\n\nStill committed the damn crime\n\nStill has majority stake in the company\n\nThis, is when collage mode drops(9). On the exact same day Kurvitz and Rostov respond. Almost as if to lead away a google search for something like \u201cDisco Elysium news\u201d or \u201cDisco Elysium update.\u201d To be literally anything but the fact that they just unabashedly lied to the public. I think the feature is a gross misunderstanding of what DE is about and its general philosophy, but this aspect is what enrages me. It's not \"just a photo mode\" it's a lame diversion tactic, and what saddens me is that it seems to be working. So please, don't let it.\n\nThis ended up being way longer than I thought (so much for short recap), but I might as well close things off with talking about why Kurvitz can\u2019t walk away. People were obsessed with DE for its amazing writing, so why can\u2019t Kurvitz just make Pissco Pelysium 2 and keep going. Because he doesn\u2019t want to write anything but stories in the world he has been crafting for 30 years. Elysium. I can\u2019t explain just how much it means to him better than he can, so I urge you to please read this statement he made to celebrate the final cut release of the game, before it was taken from him(10).\n\nThis story is only going to get more muddled, so please keep following it. I urge all of you to read every article I linked in full, it's a sad story. But they're still fighting, and I believe they'll come out on top in the end. All we can do for now is wait, but let's not forget why we're angry in the meantime.\n\n1) https://medium.com/@martinluiga/the-dissolution-of-the-za-um-cultural-association-779788390a03\n\n2)https://twitter.com/artofrostov/status/1576539500012240897?s=20\n\n3)https://www.instagram.com/p/CjQmqSfqdIq/\n\n4)https://medium.com/@artofrostov/to-fans-of-disco-elysium-concerning-the-situation-at-za-um-3e6bc46ea9c\n\n5)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/disco-elysium-studio-zaum-confirms-former-employees-were-fired-for-misconduct\n\n6)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lawsuit-against-zaum-majority-shareholder-withdrawn\n\n7)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender\n\n8)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender (Check the top of the article)\n\n9)https://twitter.com/discoelysium/status/1636383558779682819\n\n10)https://imgur.com/a/lb3i7J5 arguably the most important link here\n\n:revolutionaryhat:", "timestamp_created": 1679121349, "timestamp_updated": 1679121349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1414, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.954208135604858398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137332931": {"recommendationid": "137332931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282705835", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7497, "last_played": 1681303146}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators.

At that point, it's more to do with how much you care about seeing how you can approach the same puzzles with different skill-sets.\n\nWith that tiny issue out of the way, every other aspect of this game is as near to flawless as it gets. It starts slow with a murder mystery, and just when you start to think to yourself \"this game is cool, but when does it get interesting?\", you get to day 2. After that, mysteries begin building on top of mysteries, and when you start tugging on the threads you're given, the game unfurls like the worlds' most beautiful flower! What's with all the metaphors you ask? It's because I want to do this game justice in this review WITHOUT spoiling a single thing! Even the most seemingly mundane interactions can produce shocking results with lasting consequences!\n\nIf you enjoy point-and-clicks, this is the best one. If you enjoy story, you will be hard pressed to find a more interesting one in a video game. Hell, if you're reading this, and play tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons, this is a MUST PLAY for you! It's one of those rare gems that manages to be nearly perfect yet totally unique at the same time! The only reason it's so unique to begin with is because I have yet to see a single other developer put even one tenth the effort into building their world/story!", "timestamp_created": 1683209676, "timestamp_updated": 1683209676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 448, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928338289260864258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145641801": {"recommendationid": "145641801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123298199", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 3519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "playtime_at_review": 1746, "last_played": 1696082761}, "language": "english", "review": "Instant throbbing boner whenever Kim tells me I did a good job", "timestamp_created": 1693815795, "timestamp_updated": 1693815983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 307, "votes_funny": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925156533718109131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127827283": {"recommendationid": "127827283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399222077", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2282, "last_played": 1670059670}, "language": "english", "review": "[h3]Important Note[/h3]\nBefore I start the review, I feel the need address the issue with ZA/UM. They fired the entire creative team which are behind this game. I was not aware of this until it was brought up in the review section by other players. The game is fun yes however if you are able to, find other means to play this game instead of purchasing it, I will still give it a positive review because of the game itself not because of the publisher.\n\n[h3]Introduction[/h3]\nDisco Elysium is one game that I honestly didn't expect would live up to its hype. It seems over hyped and not my kind of game but oh boy did they blend RPG with Mystery elements well. Kudos to the team behind the Disco Elysium project. I picked it up recently when it was on sale and I'm addicted to it. I'm a big sucker for mystery game and combination of mystery and RPG is something that I have been longing for.\n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\nFor starters, the game is mostly dialogue driven kind of like visual novel but distinctive enough that it is different from visual novel. The game allows you to move around investigate the area of Martinaise and do whatever you like. From time to time there will also be \"Red Checks\" and \"White Checks\" which you will need to unlock. You can either level up your stats or equip better clothing/tools to clear the locks on it. The \"White Checks\" can be redo as many times as you want granted that you didn't progress too far into the story which will sometimes eliminate the checks entirely. To unlock the checks its basically like \"gacha\" system where you will roll the dice and hope you get equivalent or higher value than the checks. I won't get too deep into its to prevent spoiler but you should get the gits of it, its basically like gambling and its chance based and the higher level of your \"stats\", the easier it is to clear it. Throughout the story, you will be presented with tons of choices and dialogues which are well written. Some NPCs will even have special remark on your clothing and appearances which is a plus in my opinion which make it a more immersive experience. The game has naturally day and night cycle and some events can only be done on certain time of the day. The game also allows you to tackle the main objective however you like which is investigate the murder that occur there. In my playthrough there's basically minimal to none restriction, you can do whatever you want in any order you want which is a big bonus in my opinion. The side quest of the game is also fun and some of it are even goofy. The wide array of dialogues also makes it interesting to interact with the NPCs. The jokes of the game are not too over, I think it is funny and some choices are just there to throw you off your game. However, if you don't like reading and crave for a lot of action then this is not the game for you. As for the soundtrack, What can I say? The game has HARD CORE! soundtrack and I really like it. The game is overhead perspective type of game which fits the game perfectly accompanying it with great music score. The graphics are wonderful, I really like the art style on this game. The scenery of the game is also something that needs more recognition, It is astonishing and I really like the overall aesthetic they are going for.\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nIn Conclusion I think it is a great game, It might not be everyone's cup of tea but along with its quirky jokes, the scenery and even the music, this is one of my favourite game out there right now but due to what ZA/UM has done. It is really hard to recommend anyone purchasing this game. The only reason it receive positive review was because the creative team behind it did a fantastic job. In my opinion, If you like mystery and don't mind the extensive reading then this game would be suitable for you otherwise I won't recommend this to anyone that is looking for action. The game also have replayable value as I believe each experience will be different from the previous one.", "timestamp_created": 1670062450, "timestamp_updated": 1670062521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 326, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922292947769165039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133394233": {"recommendationid": "133394233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045393707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2324, "last_played": 1676965772}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Game, very HARDCORE\n0/10 Greedy Shareholders\nPlay it, don't purchase it. \nDo as you will.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677121593, "timestamp_updated": 1677121593, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1070, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.916841804981231689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124142397": {"recommendationid": "124142397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049875963", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 9194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9194, "last_played": 1666323628}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever made\n\nThat said, the creative core of the team who created this game and the universe it's set in were forced out of the company last year.

As someone who, much like the protagonist of this game, deals with a lifetime of brain damaging activities and experiences it\u2019s rare I remember any kind of quote.  For people like us, namely those that concurrently fear and crave nostalgia, there must be something comforting in the thought that though we may forget there is a reason for why we are who we are.  Call it the first law of existence: reality cannot be created or destroyed, only transmuted from one form to another.  \n\tOur shared hobby dear reader, the playing and enjoyment of video games, is not an example but the example of the first law.  When we sit down in front of the screen and load up a game, we leave our reality for another.  We transmogrify our money, our time, our being, and everything in the physical realm into the digital.  For many its entertainment, but in the time I\u2019ve been interacting with the Steam community I have come to realize its also escapism.  Video games are just the latest and greatest escape but there have been many others before it: books, movies, songs, paintings, sculpture, poems, dirty limericks.?. there\u2019s probably more I\u2019m overlooking\u2026\n\tBut the common theme that all \u201cgreat\u201d versions of those things have is that they touch something, inside of you (no not like that...well maybe sometimes\u2026).  It is as though you\u2019re giving off some frequency throughout life and you\u2019re just searching for something, anything, that\u2019s on that same frequency.  It\u2019s an instinctual need to be connected and know you are not just on your own, wandering the pale.  And when you do finally come across that same frequency, it acts as a lighthouse or a beacon.  A guide that casts out across the void to guide you towards something.  Something that you are missing.  Something that you need.  What that something is can be different for everyone.  Abstractly though, the goal of that thing is to lead you towards yourself.  Who you are. Why you\u2019re here. What you mean and what it means to be you.  It is both purpose incarnate and the conceptual realization that purpose is a fantasy.    \n\tFatalism can be deadly in this quest.  Not because nothing matters, or that everything matters.  But because both are true and untrue.  This abstraction can be so decohering for some that they just lean on lying to themselves as a defense mechanism.  They use tools like blaming others, ostracism, denial and delusion.  The tools actuate actions like hate, disgust, and pushing others away.  That last one can be especially devastating.  Some will take all that vitriol and isolate themselves on some remote island, physical or metaphorical, and stew in it for 43 years.  Other forms are more insidious. Running on maniacal autopilot as you destroy your own life with your eyes closed. Until one day you realize six years have passed and you find yourself begging those that left you to give you just one. More. Chance. Only to discover you\u2019re pleading with echoes of memories long since past\u2026\n\n\u201cHey that\u2019s great and all Pyro, but hOw WAs thE GaME?!\u201d Keep your pants, on I\u2019m getting there.  \n\nDisco Elysium is on my frequency.  My life is more complete having played it than it was before I played it.  It makes me appreciative that there are people in the world whom I will never meet but they still have created something that touched a part of me that made me feel less alone in the pale.  It is not just a fun, well made, and entertaining game but it is quite possibly one of the greatest games ever made.  The fact that there are people out in the world who have not played it makes me sad.  Everyone that plays video games, hell everyone with a computer should get to experience this game.  \n\nI have been doing this review thing for a few years now.  If you\u2019re a regular reader of them and have come to trust my judgement or taste, please do yourself a favor and buy this game.

It will keep you company as you wait without power for a glorious future that will never come \u2014 and even if it did, would end up being stupid.\"\n\nCharacters full of life, internal and external complexity make the nominally isometric but truthfully ceaseless world of Elysium into a real part of your life, revealing more dimensions than a single 140-hour playthrough could ever hope to meaningfully explore. No, the streets of Revachol West, of Martinaise, will live in your heart, your mind, the very depths of your soul: All 24 components of your being (in addition to your Limbic System and Ancient Reptilian Brain) will be enveloped in the emotional, political, spiritual tensions that are ever-rising in these streets. Long after you last walked through Rue de Saint-Ghislaine or Rue de Saint-Brune, sensed the saltiness of the coast, or heard the haunting themes and thorough, deeply sensitive voices that color the intricate sound palette of each location and situation, you will continue to fixate on every nook and cranny of Elysium's (and by proxy, your own world's) bruised, rugged reality \u2014 the entirety of the \"world-stuff\", so to speak: fictional and tangible, an extension of this Earth, a ghostly limb.\n\nA poet's distant dreams gone sour, yearning with bitterness for lost opportunities that were snuffed out, resulting in failure and death; though perhaps it wasn't a poet, but a tired revolutionary, a symbol of lost hope, lost love? Or maybe it was a rambling drunk. Who knows, the real battle is that which takes place between outrageous hilarity and sadness, between deep meanings and the profound awareness of their ridiculousness, between the desire to communicate and the both literal and metaphorical roll of the dice that takes place whenever you attempt to do so.\n\nThere is a two-millimeter hole in the world that keeps growing and is coming for us all, so how do we fight back, powerless, hopeless and ignorant as we are? Maybe we go on precisely because it is impossible, and this hope-beyond-hope is all that could hold our fractured selves together and drive our collective will to do *some* good.

Because I believe that ZAUM has worked to make this intentionally muddled when it's honestly as clear cut as can be. Keep in mind that I am more than a little biased and please tell me if I get anything wrong or leave out important details so I can correct them.\n\nIt started in October of 2022 when Martin Luiga made a medium post(1) saying the ZAUM cultural association had dissolved. This association is where the ZAUM company was born from, and in that article he makes it clear that neither he, Robert Kurvitz (Lead Writer), Aleksander Rostov (Lead Artist), and Helen Hindpere (writer) are working at ZAUM, and implies they left unwillingly. The next day the claim that they no longer work there is followed up with confirmation by Rostov(2). As of that point in the timeline this was the only statement ZAUM had made on the matter(3). People weren't happy.\n\nRostov makes his own comprehensive statement on Medium(4), giving everyone more detail on the situation. The current majority shareholder and investors of ZAUM fired them unfairly. They believe that they were being intentionally shut out once their old majority shareholder was bought out, as they had begun to get excluded from daily company operations. What's important is Rostov and Kurvitz believe that the two new majority shareholders in ZAUM, Ilmar Kompus and T\u00f5nis Haavel, had obtained their majority share illegally. They did this by buying a majority stake with ZAUM\u2019s own funds, which surprise surprise, is illegal. Kurvitz and Rostov claimed they were fired after asking for financial documents.\n\nIn response, ZAUM claimed that actually Kurvitz and Rostov and Hindpere were all fired for misconduct. Specifically, they were fired for(5):\n\n\u25cf Limited to no engagement in their responsibilities and work \u2013 including not working at all for almost two years while still being paid by the studio \u2013 and forcing colleagues to compensate for their lack of effort.\n\n\u25cf Creating a toxic work environment that is antithetical to the ZA/UM culture and team productivity.\n\n\u25cf Misconduct in interacting with other colleagues that includes verbal abuse and gender discrimination.\n\n\u25cf Attempts to illegally sell to other gaming companies ZA/UM\u2019s intellectual property with the aim of undermining the rest of the team.\n\nObviously they deny all of these claims, but you should read the whole article on this one, it's so clear that they're lying it's almost funny. Rostov and Kurvitz made it clear they are intending to pursue legal action for both the fraud and the unfair termination.\n\nThis is where things get confusing and most fans fall off, I believe this is a result of Kurvitz and Rostov\u2019s general lack of communication with the public due to ongoing litigation combined with ZAUM\u2019s lame attempts to spin the story in their direction.\n\nKarl Kender, who also left ZAUM in August, had filed a suit against Kompus specifically, stating that he believed they cheated him out of millions(6). This was quickly withdrawn, however with the withdrawn lawsuit, Kompus and Haavel quietly repaid 5.1 million dollars to ZAUM (not admitting that they stole it). This left us all confused as we didn\u2019t know exactly what was happening in regards to Kurvitz\u2019s game.\n\nThis exchange was the last real information we got until Tuesday, in which ZAUM suddenly released a statement saying that it was all over. Kender had repaid all the debts he owed to the company (while never directly admitting he stole them). This left everyone in a weird limbo, as we had no idea what would happen from here. All we knew was that Kurvitz\u2019s suit was still ongoing.\n\nWe get no word until this Tuesday, March 14. ZAUM out of the blue claims that everything is now resolved(7). They said that the unfair termination suit by Kurvitz and Rostov was dropped due to lack of evidence, and that Kompus had paid the money back in full, and Kender had paid Kompus for all legal fees for his withdrawn suit back in December, resolving the situation.\n\nIt\u2019s important here to talk about the news cycle. It\u2019s generally important to a company that searching their name on google doesn't bring up hundreds of articles about how fraudulent they are, so for a few days, searches of their name were good for the first time. \u201cDisco Elysium suit resolved, situation over\u201d\n\nThis lasted all of two days, because yesterday on March 16th, Kurvitz and Rostov responded to that claim(8), saying that no they had not withdrawn the suit, and returning stolen money doesn\u2019t fix anything, since he\n\nStill committed the damn crime\n\nStill has majority stake in the company\n\nThis, is when collage mode drops(9). On the exact same day Kurvitz and Rostov respond. Almost as if to lead away a google search for something like \u201cDisco Elysium news\u201d or \u201cDisco Elysium update.\u201d To be literally anything but the fact that they just unabashedly lied to the public. I think the feature is a gross misunderstanding of what DE is about and its general philosophy, but this aspect is what enrages me. It's not \"just a photo mode\" it's a lame diversion tactic, and what saddens me is that it seems to be working. So please, don't let it.\n\nThis ended up being way longer than I thought (so much for short recap), but I might as well close things off with talking about why Kurvitz can\u2019t walk away. People were obsessed with DE for its amazing writing, so why can\u2019t Kurvitz just make Pissco Pelysium 2 and keep going. Because he doesn\u2019t want to write anything but stories in the world he has been crafting for 30 years. Elysium. I can\u2019t explain just how much it means to him better than he can, so I urge you to please read this statement he made to celebrate the final cut release of the game, before it was taken from him(10).\n\nThis story is only going to get more muddled, so please keep following it. I urge all of you to read every article I linked in full, it's a sad story. But they're still fighting, and I believe they'll come out on top in the end. All we can do for now is wait, but let's not forget why we're angry in the meantime.\n\n1) https://medium.com/@martinluiga/the-dissolution-of-the-za-um-cultural-association-779788390a03\n\n2)https://twitter.com/artofrostov/status/1576539500012240897?s=20\n\n3)https://www.instagram.com/p/CjQmqSfqdIq/\n\n4)https://medium.com/@artofrostov/to-fans-of-disco-elysium-concerning-the-situation-at-za-um-3e6bc46ea9c\n\n5)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/disco-elysium-studio-zaum-confirms-former-employees-were-fired-for-misconduct\n\n6)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lawsuit-against-zaum-majority-shareholder-withdrawn\n\n7)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender\n\n8)https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zaum-resolves-legal-dispute-with-disco-elysium-producer-kaur-kender (Check the top of the article)\n\n9)https://twitter.com/discoelysium/status/1636383558779682819\n\n10)https://imgur.com/a/lb3i7J5 arguably the most important link here", "timestamp_created": 1682679943, "timestamp_updated": 1682679943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792614281177520752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140997061": {"recommendationid": "140997061", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999938428", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1696570369}, "language": "english", "review": "A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best.

Your character wakes up without his memory and has to try to solve a local murder with little information about himself or the case. \n\nAt first, the game can feel like a lot. It was hard for me to get into it because it was so text-heavy and the dice rolling mechanic confused me. But, having more experience now with the mechanics, I tried replaying it again recently and it was AMAZING.\n\nThe style of the game is truly artistic and beautiful. Even the sound design is so detailed and on point. The writing is incredibly detailed as well. Since it is VERY text/dialogue-heavy (like legit paragraphs at a time), there is so much depth to the characters. You can truly see the amount of time and effort that was put into this game just based on the writing. \n\nThere are so many different skills and paths your character can take, and you have full control over it. There is a lot of freedom that comes from controlling a character who lost his memory lol. It took me 36 hours for my first playthrough and I know there was a lot of stuff I missed. And not just stuff missed, but also different paths and options.\n\nWhile the game is fully voiced, I found myself just mostly reading the text because it was faster. If you don't like reading, you'll definitely find this game slow and boring. It just isn't for everyone and that's okay.\nSo, if you love slower, text-heavy games, I highly recommend this game because it truly is art.", "timestamp_created": 1694033692, "timestamp_updated": 1694033692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780567049980163574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143741303": {"recommendationid": "143741303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079643877", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1689466745}, "language": "english", "review": "Super secret Kim sex scene 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691615342, "timestamp_updated": 1691615342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778636515140533447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133517654": {"recommendationid": "133517654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151146185", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 225, "playtime_forever": 1853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1853, "last_played": 1673032866}, "language": "english", "review": "she disco on my elysium till I final cut", "timestamp_created": 1677266649, "timestamp_updated": 1677266649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 226, "votes_funny": 104, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777890503406524658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131276976": {"recommendationid": "131276976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034315837", "num_games_owned": 7300, "num_reviews": 653, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1674324830}, "language": "english", "review": "An honest to goodness role playing game. \n\nThe term is so bastardized that it can mean anything nowadays but it's good to see there's still some games that actually lets you role play through discourse and dialogue primarily.

You can read it all here : https://gameworldobserver.com/2022/11/23/disco-elysium-za-um-takeover-4-8-million-sketches-resold . This is quite an interesting read.\nHowever, there's still hope for the creators to get some money back, so I was ok to pay for my copy. Your mileage may vary, so act in your own conscience.\n\n[h1]=== My Opinion ===[/h1]\nDisco Elysium is a great game, an exceptional game. It's an RPG from before RPG meant combats, loot & raising skills.\nThe writing is chiseled, the world captivating, the characters memorable, the life lessons & thoughts uncountable.\n\nIt's a mature game, and has a lot of political interrogations. Its roots are clearly from the East block : the post-USSR world, eaten away by capitalism.\nFor my western-world eyes, it felt \"exotic\" while hitting home so many times.\n\nThere is a _lot_ of reading (or listening, as everything is voiced over), and some running around. And no combat.\n\nThe game isn't without noticeable flaws, though : the inventory management is tedious, especially as you're encouraged to often switch clothes to get different bonuses for different situations. Other quirks come into the way here & there. Nothing too bad, but it slightly impairs the overall experience.\n\nA more serious matter : it feels like the game misses a final chapter. (see the Spoiler section below)\n\nMoreover, you may be missing a few parts of the game because they'll get locked away without a proper warning.\n\nDespite these little things, the game is still a masterpiece and if it just slightly attracts you, you should really give it a try ; just know that it's more about the journey & the experience than anything else.\n\n\n[h1]+++ Pros +++[/h1]\n- Unique enticing world : a district devastated from an old war, with a feel from the post-communist era, where capitalism is not the announced savior\n- The main character is an anti-hero that will grow on you, probably pretty quickly\n- The sidekick (no need for explanation, you'll see)\n- The skill system, to unlock dialog options and world challenges, is pretty well thought\n- Failing some challenges actually lead to good or interesting consequences\n- Very convincing voice-over for all characters\n\n\n[h1]--- Cons ---[/h1]\n- The world isn't that big, especially the [spoiler]port[/spoiler] side could have been bigger\n- A good part of the world & its stories don't feel connected enough to the main story (you can almost completely ignore it and still beat the game, without missing any really valuable information, except a possible reason for our [spoiler]hero's memory loss[/spoiler])\n- The game proposes you to dismiss thoughts, but there's no reason to do so (so say \"yes\" every time, and you can decide later on if you want to actually do the thought research or not)\n- Painful inventory management, especially once you have many clothes\n- A few dice challenges really make you want to save scum to succeed in them\n- I got stuck in the middle of the adventure because it was very not clear how to achieve a goal ; I found out what to do in the end, but it was a big mood breaker\n- One quest couldn't be done because of a bug ; I had to save scum to succeed the super hard dice challenge instead\n\n\n[h1]~~~ Major Spoilers ~~~[/h1]\nNow, you can go to play the game, but I'd like to expose some thoughts here ; you can come back once you'll have beat it... ;-)\n\n1) The whole central point of the murder resolution is illogical. If you carefully analyze what happened, and what the characters have said, you'll see it doesn't make sense and there are a couple of contradictions that cannot be solved.\n\nMy own theory is that the game should have had a final chapter, but it wasn't done. I couldn't find any online article supporting this though.\n\nHowever, the writers clearly give hints as to what really happened when we talk to the final suspect. Although, it's hard to get it all out of him, so maybe that's why most players didn't bring that up as they just didn't get the clues.\n\nSo all in all, I was very surprised by the abrupt ending. Even one of the ending dialogs hinted I had missed something... I had to check the game wiki to be sure I hadn't actually missed anything in the game.\n\n2) One somewhat important part of the game requires a key. Once the \"event that locks out the port\" happened, you cannot see the key anymore in the room, although it should still be there as there's no reason for it to go away. I had to use an old saved game to check what I had missed.\n\n3) I really cried (a bit) when I saw the insect ; I thought I went crazy (I mean more than usual :steammocking: ), but actually I found out that some other people felt the same : it's a beautiful and kinda magic moment in the game.\n\n4) Our hero seems to have done nothing during the 3 days before the game start (except fucking up big time), while on one hand it feels in contradiction with what Kim exposed, and on the other hand, walking in our own steps could have been better exploited.", "timestamp_created": 1678717477, "timestamp_updated": 1678717477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766230106353759766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140815594": {"recommendationid": "140815594", "author": {"steamid": "76561199065408862", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 21571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21571, "last_played": 1687469782}, "language": "english", "review": "Disco Elysium is a narrative-driven role-playing game that is filled with dark humor and adult themes.

So I played, and it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe story unfolds in some surreal manner, with different areas of your body speaking to you, helping you make decisions about the Murder Mystery you're tasked with solving. There's also your stalwart partner, Kim, who is a rock and a beacon and helps you make sense of the brave new world you're investigating.

You're a detective and, utilizing a unique skill system, will crack down on murders taking place across a city block that you can freely carve your path across. Interrogate, take bribes, and become a hero...or a horrific human being...as you have the freedom to choose how you make your mark. Disco Elysium also had a final cut upgrade which added new quests, controller support, language switching, and full voice acting! Trust me, this is probably one of the greatest story-driven RPG games ever made, but can you really enjoy it on the Steam Deck?\n\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nWhen it comes to max settings, Disco Elysium can almost hit it throughout the entire game, but it isn't consistent. In the game, there are two main scenes you can be in, inside and outside. Inside rooms or buildings, the game doesn't slow down at all with max settings hitting around 13W battery drain and a solid 60 FPS. But as soon as you step outside, the drain spikes to 21W with a 53-55 FPS range. What we need to do is optimize the game for outside scenes, and luckily, it isn't hard to do.\n\nBecause of the type of game Disco Elysium is, I felt hitting 60 FPS wouldn't be hard to do and I was kind of right. Hitting 60 FPS is very do-able, but as soon as you step outside into the open world, the game can easily slow down noticeably. To fix this, I turned off anti-aliasing, which helped a little, and dynamic shadows, which helped a lot. This brought down a 20W drain outside to under 13W, increasing battery life from 1.75 hours to 3+ while keeping a stable 60.\n\nDynamic Shadow Quality is the biggest change in the settings that really affect the game visually and performance wise. While some scenes are affected heavily by it, a lot of them aren't and can save on performance. Below, we are providing 2 examples of scenes, one where it isn't a huge change and one where it is:\n\nI also understand that these shadows can be huge graphically and some will want it regardless, so I elected to create a max quality build that sets TDP to 10, turns on dynamic shadows and anti-aliasing, and sets FPS to 55. While this may not seem like a huge downgrade compared to the recommended build, there are some issues I have.\n\nWhen testing any framerate below 60, there was a lot of stuttering. 30 FPS was ok, but 40 FPS and even 50 were very obvious. I found 55 to be the least noticeable while helping to keep any performance drops in check. It is still there if you look closely, but if you aren't actively looking for it, you should be fine. There are still some drops to 54 and 53 outside, but they aren't noticeable.\n\nThere is some frame drops I noticed in Disco Elysium regardless of the build. This was most prevalent when going into the skill menu and would regularly drop a little. It also happened when going into the open areas with the camera zoomed all the way out, but it wasn't impactful on the game itself.\n\nSomething I believe Disco Elysium should be praised for is their accessibility features. Not only do they have keyboard remapping and easy language switching, they have an option for a dyslexic-friendly font and the ability to resize text of the menus and dialog. This is extremely helpful on a small screen and will keep reading dialog easy without any eye strain.\n\nDisco Elysium is an incredible game in its own right and so worth the time to invest and put into it. The writing is fantastic, the world is invigorating, and the skill system and freedom you have is wonderful. On top of that, with those minor tweaks, it becomes a fantastic game to play on the Steam Deck. And again, props to the developers who added in text resizing, thank you!\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1667675554, "timestamp_updated": 1667675609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684629201889038086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137661462": {"recommendationid": "137661462", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989912770", "num_games_owned": 1130, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 1288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1191, "last_played": 1690530728}, "language": "english", "review": "The writers made a story about how Capitalism is bad, then had their masterpiece stolen by greedy investors via hostile takeover.

On any other occasion i would wholeheartedly recommend this, and ive even gotten a few people into the game. \n\nBut given recent events with the behind the scenes at the ZA/UM development team i cannot recommend this game. Investors behind ZA/UM forced the games lead writer/designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere and lead artist Aleksander Rostov out of the company in late 2021 and has since been slowly replacing the Estonian and Finnish team with designers from London, Brighton, New york, etc. Any cultural influence or background these original designers brought to the game will be missing and void in whatever ZA/UM releases next, and it genuinely sucks to see. Not to mention that in February of 2022, only a few months after booting the trio from the company, the investors struck a deal with Amazon for a Disco Elysium amazon series. all i can really do is laugh at the absurdity of it.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that this new ZA/UM team are hiring people with a goal to turn the next ZA/UM product into a game with microtransactions, DLC, and live-service features in order to \"maximise revenue\". Joyce Messier, a character from Disco Elysium, literally says [b] \"Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead\" [/b]. The utter irony that this is the path ZA/UM has taken. \n\nThere is outrage on places like twitter and reddit in full support of Kurvitz, Hindpere and Rostov and an almost unanimous opinion that whatever comes next from the studio will be soulless and lacking in vision or originality. After all of this I cannot recommend that you buy this game because it would mean supporting a company that does not respect its own creative direction and lacks self awareness. If you really want to play it, just pirate it. Nor would I recommend spending any money on future products, start thinking with your wallets about what you are comfortable with supporting.

Our stake in the game exists in the form of minority shareholdings in an Estonian company called Zaum Studio O\u00dc, which owns everything related to the game. The majority of this company\u2019s shares were initially held by Margus Linnam\u00e4e, an Estonian businessman and investor who provided the initial capital. In 2021, Linnam\u00e4e was bought out by another minority shareholder, an Estonian company T\u00fctreke O\u00dc. T\u00fctreke O\u00dc is a vehicle for two Estonian businessmen \u2014 Ilmar Kompus and T\u00f5nis Haavel.\n\nAs minority shareholders our rights are limited. As long as Linnam\u00e4e remained the majority shareholder, we were confident that the company\u2019s financials were in order and that all shareholders were being treated equally. The same can not be said for Kompus and Haavel. As soon as they became majority shareholders, we were quickly excluded from daily operations, our employment was terminated and our access to the company\u2019s information was shut off. Our firing came weeks after we started asking for documents and financial data, which is still being kept from us.\n\nWe have now learned that T\u00fctreke O\u00dc must have obtained control over Zaum Studio O\u00dc by fraud. We believe the money used by T\u00fctreke O\u00dc to buy the majority stake was taken illegally from Zaum Studio O\u00dc itself, money that belonged to the studio and all shareholders but was used for the benefit of one. Money that should have gone towards making the sequel. We believe that these actions \u2014 which in our view, and the view of our lawyers, amount to criminal wrongdoing punishable by up to three years imprisonment \u2014 were perpetrated by Ilmar Kompus and T\u00f5nis Haavel with support from Kaur Kender, another minority shareholder. This is hardly surprising given that T\u00f5nis Haavel, who we believe to be the ringleader, has been convicted for defrauding investors on a different matter in 2007 [https://www.riigiteataja.ee/kohtulahendid/fail.html?fid=303963621].\n\nWe are now in the process of reviewing our legal options. Both civil claims and criminal charges are on the table \u2014 in Estonia and the United Kingdom.\n\nNeedless to say, it has been a very difficult time for us. After five years of gruelling work we released Disco Elysium, a game beloved by millions. As our reward, we were summarily fired and cut off from our life\u2019s work \u2014 the world of Elysium. The company we built has been looted, while our own earnings are insufficient even to cover legal fees.\n\nUntil now, we\u2019ve refrained from speaking out. This has been entirely voluntary, out of consideration for the people still working at ZA/UM \u2014 and for our own mental health. But given the severity of our suspicions \u2014 and the seriousness of the evidence we have \u2014 we think it\u2019s time people knew what has transpired at the company.\n\nWe remain eternally thankful to all the fans of Disco Elysium, who have offered us invaluable moral support. We still believe in games, we still believe in ourselves \u2014 and we still believe in you. Millions of RPG fans have proven that games like Disco Elysium have a mass audience. This is a truly wonderous thing. No one can take that from us.\n\nWe also believe in what Harrier du Bois calls \u201cthe law\u201d.

We talked the man who delivered it to the public.\n\nOn October 1, 2022, the co-founder of the former ZA/UM Cultural Association and editor of Disco Elysium, Martin Luiga, announced the dissolution of said association. Reasons? Loss of values and ethos by ZA/UM studio somewhere along the way. He also recalled that other originators of the Elysium universe (and the cRPG created inside it) \u2013 namely, Robert Kurvitz, Helen Hindpere and Alexander Rostov \u2013 were pushed out of the studio in late 2021. [/quote] \n\n[hr][/hr] \n[i]For us, Elysium was that idea. It kept us together and gave us something to work on. We couldn't say someone else can do this. The object was unique and we its guardians. We felt otherworldy promise in that interisolary mass, connected by invisible lines through the pale. Seol, Khasht-Kor, Innu NR, Marel-\u00d6ver-V\u00e4rlden... 4.6 billion people, after all, are not easily let down. \n\nElysium is a collection of ideas into which we poured all of our love of the world. And its history. It's what we think is worthwhile in all this - recollected, resequenced, and reconceptualized. Its people are heroic even when they're jokes. Its failures are majesty and terror. It's large. It is a geopolitical dream seen by non-entities. Nobodies from nowhere. Its value is inversely proportionate to our own size.\n\nSo far we've only managed to show you a tiny, insignificant corner of it: the district of Martinaise in Revachol West, on  Insulinde. I can not begin to tell you how introductory it is. (\"Disco Elysium\" means \"I learn Elysium\") It's small. A matchbox world. It's all we had money for.\n\nYet because of You - you angel, you legend, our comrade in arms- because of your interest in our idea, we get to see more of it. Jamrock, I hope. And then to other isolas.\n\nThank you. We hope you enjoy the Final Cut.\n\nRobert Kurvitz, lead designer / lead writer\nBrighton, England\nDecember 2020[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr] \n[*][b] [url=https://twitter.com/KatiKnitt/status/1578107445162885121?s=20&t=KkYCJmOk5QDrC4hvF_6ThA] \"I wondered, how many writers credited on Disco Elysium DO still work at ZA/UM?

Imagine a detective story that starts simple but spirals into a mesmerizing maze of weirdness. It's like mixing Dungeons & Dragons with a grim narrative of violence, poverty, and societal collapse. And it's wrapped up in unique gameplay mechanics, like arguing with different sections of your own brain. Trust me, it's as crazy and captivating as it sounds.\n\nIn Disco Elysium, you're a detective in a rundown city, trying to solve a murder mystery while battling your own amnesia and inner demons. The game's mix of dialogue and its brilliantly crafted world turn solving crimes into a journey that's as personal as it is societal. And somehow, it's all blended with humor, making even the darkest moments oddly funny.\n\nNow, with The Final Cut, the game's been upgraded with voice acting and more side quests. And let me tell you, it's taken an already amazing game and made it even better.\n\nThe gameplay is like nothing else. At the start, you pick a detective style, which shapes your abilities. You can be smart, sensitive, or tough, affecting how you approach problems. The game's skill system is brilliant, with each skill being a unique voice in your detective's head, guiding you in conversations and challenges.\n\nAnd there's no traditional combat here. It's all about dialogue and skill checks. Solving problems is about picking the right words and using your skills effectively. It's more engaging than any sword fight, and it gives the game a refreshing edge.\n\nThe world of Disco Elysium is a beautifully grim place. It's a city on the brink, filled with characters as intriguing as they are flawed. Each face you encounter tells a story, and you'll uncover secrets through careful exploration and conversations.\n\nThe game's story isn't just about solving a murder. It's a journey into the minds of the characters and the city itself. The dialogue is sharp, darkly funny, and it delves deep into serious themes. It's a detective fantasy that also prompts you to think about your own beliefs.\n\nDisco Elysium's cast of characters is diverse and memorable. You'll connect with them as you navigate the gritty streets of Martinaise. One of the highlights is your partner, Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi. He's a dry-humored, analytic companion who adds depth to the story.\n\nThe Final Cut's addition of fully voiced characters enhances the experience even further. It's like hearing the characters you imagined in your head come to life. The dialogue remains masterfully written, making each conversation a delight.\n\nDisco Elysium's world is dense but not overwhelming. It encourages you to explore and absorb every detail. The city of Revachol is as much a character as anyone else, with its snow-covered streets and crumbling buildings. It's a setting that sucks you in, making every moment worth savoring.\n\nTo wrap it up, Disco Elysium is a masterpiece that mixes detective noir with philosophical musings. The Final Cut takes an already outstanding game and turns it into an even more captivating experience. If you're up for a mind-bending journey that's both weird and wonderful, Disco Elysium is an absolute must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1693121873, "timestamp_updated": 1693121873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616684854030609131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127774942": {"recommendationid": "127774942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139365601", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1669450235}, "language": "english", "review": "Here I will leave the cat, friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up <3\n\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\ud83c\udf38\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064", "timestamp_created": 1669999991, "timestamp_updated": 1689519223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615862250328063965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123369261": {"recommendationid": "123369261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384379066", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1877, "last_played": 1626146261}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I have never played a game for this small amount of hours that has this much world depth. There is so much knowledge you can squeeze out of this game.\n\nThe game is purely dialogue driven which concerned me at first, but it really surprised me at how it works. Different \"personalities\" of your brain can chip in with their own opinions, basically as if each personality trait is its own person over your shoulder. Whether one is reliable or not in the current situation, that is up to you to decide - that makes dialogue so much more interesting. I also like how this game doesn't encourage you to minmax your skills so that you get to experience a wide array of thoughts, emotions and outcomes.\n\nThis game understands the fact that human brains are very complex and offers a good portrayal of how the brain thinks. In fact, sometimes your thoughts are so meta that it actually makes me think that the game is playing me instead of the other way around.\n\nHowever, the game is heavy on politics so be aware of what you are getting yourself into. Either way, if you wanted to know where you lean politically, I guess this game will help you find out.\n\nI would really give this game a go if you want a great RPG experience (unless you are not into heavy dialogue or you have the attention span of a goldfish).", "timestamp_created": 1667643550, "timestamp_updated": 1667643550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614838123321533203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135377361": {"recommendationid": "135377361", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089197339", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4995, "last_played": 1679743987}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, just a really bad company.

There was rumoured to be a fraudulent takeover of the studio (ZA/UM) who develop and produce this, using money stolen from them in the first place, and following this, writer and lead designer, Robert Kurvitz, and art director, Alexander Rostov, were sacked, and another employee, Kaur Kender, Estonian novelist and executive producer of Disco Elysium, filed a lawsuit against the company who fraudulently took over ZA/UM, only to withdraw this when the stolen money was paid back.

But that faded after about 7 hours and at times was replaced by the feeling of pure boredom with what was being said. That said, there is still some intrigue in the story and figuring out how to solve the case. The voice acting is still very good and there are still dialogue that make me laugh and lots of funny choices for you to select for your character. I just feel a lot of the dialogue tends to be very log winded and boring at times.\n\nIt was a little daunting at first when I started playing and then the tasks started piling up, the many menu screens with no real explanation on what each card or attribute is for. I played for near 10 hours, no achievements popped, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was even getting anywhere. I followed instructions in my tasks list and proceeded to buy some alcohol and drink it to cure the hangover, but then my moral plummeted and then I died! \n\nI\u2019d never played a point and click game where I could die by doing what I thought was following the tasks required, or by just inspecting an item in my inventory. This game is different. Sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, sometimes frustrating at how you can spend a whole day, in game and in real life, and not feel like you have gotten hardly anywhere. The game feels very unrewarding and when it is, this comes in small rations.\n\nI can\u2019t say if I will complete this game or if it will get better the further I progress. \nBut it doesn\u2019t really matter, thanks to the publisher, it\u2019s all a big waste of time anyway. Don\u2019t buy, don\u2019t support the publisher as those who created this will never see any royalties for this. Don\u2019t buy the sequel (if it\u2019s made by ZA/UM). \n\nI\u2019m seriously sceptical of the metacritic score this has been given as well, 97?

Particularly as I quickly learnt autosaves are infrequent and meant you had to save spam or keep doing conversations over again. Which are walls of text. A literal black wall of it. Ominously framing the side of the screen for 90% of my brief experience with it. \n\nRather than looking forward to this popping up, I actively dreaded it every time I clicked anything or did anything in this world, distracting the entirety of my attention from the beautiful painted city I was supposed to be living in, exploring and deciphering. The screenshots and videos show you predominantly exploring and being in this wondrously dank place most of the time. Not so. The black tombstone of words is there. Demanding you engage with it and devolving that world into little more than a point and click painting that also conveniently highlights the limited things you can engage with. That almost certainly leads to your dark overlord taskmaster.\n\nWhile there are plenty of choices to select for this character, they are ultimately just painful as you can't make effective plans with your choices. Decide to not pay your bill; your character could just walk out for a consequence to come up later, right? This game; no. He's going to 180-no-scope-flip-the-double-bird-off to the manager and leap backwards into an elderly woman, have an existential crisis and game over. Initially I genuinely laughed at the absurdity of it. Upon second thought I realised I felt like I had absolutely no agency over that decision. How could I possibly have known the character I've spent little more than 30 mins with that I'm intending to embody would do that and have such extreme consequences that quickly?  How about explore this dumpster? I've found my notebook, lets browse through it (more text rather than an actual notebook to explore...). Ooo a secret compartment. I should read what's in it, maybe I'll learn something good...Nope...existential crisis upon learning a truth. Game Over. Better make sure you had a decent save to go back to!\n\nThis game actively punishes exploration and curiosity to force you into something it wants you to. If that's the case, just don't give me these other options to explore that's just going to waste my limited personal time.

A lot of work has obviously gone into world-building here, but I found this world less than intriguing because it is such an obvious parallel to the real world, complete with all our real world social issues (unions vs corporations, racist nationalism, poverty, alcoholism, etc.). The alternate universe setting doesn't add much to the story and only serves to add linguistic confusion.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, and the voice acting is fantastic, but the gameplay is just not fun.

The writing is thorough (to the point I bet we all skimmed a fair amount of sections) and you can certainly miss some fun plot lines by not exploring everything.

Your choices in the game and where you spend your skill points do change this character, but by and large you're playing the character. The game is ABOUT this character. It's not a blank space to be whomever you want to be, you are assuredly him. But you can develop him in unique ways. The game does have a central plot, but you'd do well to note that the game is more about the character than the plot. You may solve the plot. You may not. But the game is not really about that, not entirely. \n\nThe character, plot, and world building feel like they're building up to a crescendo. When the end of the game finally rolled around I felt, honestly, a bit let down. Because saying goodbye to this character is the let-down. This isn't a complaint about the ending because I can't say that I would have wanted my game to end any other way (there are multiple endings), but rather that you dive so deeply into this one person, into one character, and at the end, the game wrenches you back out to remind you how small you are compared to some of the larger machinations.

However, that is not even close to all this game has to offer. It seriously knocks everything out of the park:\n\nSTORY - Layers upon layers. Very mysterious and extremely interesting. Touches on topics such as love and politics beautifully.\nCHARACTERS - There is an amazing variety of personalities. You'll meet war criminals, mob bosses, cryptozoologists, unapologetic racists, a pageant queen, and many other sorts of eccentrics.\nWORLD BUILDING/ATMOSPHERE - They really crafted something special here, this is an unforgettable setting. Characters casually name drop all of these new fictional corporations, countries, and races. You have to connect them all together and figure out where you stand. Traces of science fiction and the supernatural are present.\nGAMEPLAY - There isn't any \"combat\". You lose health/morale by making bad dialogue choices or failing certain skill checks, lose enough and you die. You improve skills by leveling them up, wearing certain clothes, or doing certain drugs. It's all pretty simple and accessible, and for this game I think it's perfect. \nVISUALS - Art style is beautiful, with charming oil painting character portraits. The landscape looks amazing as well. UI works and looks good.\nAUDIO - Soundtrack is very solid, with some standout tracks. The voice acting sounds amazing, especially the narrator.\n\nCan't praise this game enough, it is flawless.

You have yet the chance to be born into the Disco world, with all it's glorious misery, suffering and a tiny, may-bell coloured speck of... hope? Setting your foot on an untouched snow, blazing a trail of your own making.\n\nThis game is very hard to describe. Is it an RPG? In a way, yes. Is it a visual novel? Most certainly. Is it a detective? Of course. A puzzle? Maybe. A psychological manifest? Indeed. A political agenda? Heck, yeah! A madman rambling? It is! And at the same time it's none of that. It's a gaming singularity that takes many things upon itself and emerges as something absolutely unprecedented and unheard of. Disco Elysium is a story, your own unique story of depravity, redemption, madness and stoicism - it's really up to you how it will unfold. \n\nBut there is one thing that i can say for certain - in my whole gaming life i have not encountered anything like this one game. The word \"masterpiece\" is too shallow to describe this game, because it's so, so much deeper than that. Disco Elysium is a product of a very particular time, place and, of course, people - that could only happen once in a generation and it will not repeat itself ever again, even if the others would try to copy or imitate it. And if it is still somehow unclear - yes, I recommend this game, I more than recommend it - I kneel in awe before this granite slab of pure genius.\n\nBut there is one small caveat, that i have to warn you before you consider buying it. No matter how brilliant this game is, but the story of a drunk, depressed, deranged, regretting his life choices cop - it's not something that can hit a deep chord with a younger audience. So the younger you are, the higher the chance that this game will not \"hit\" you. I'd say that to truly appreciate it - you have to be at least over 25y.o. or even better - 30. It's hard to imagine a teen enjoying this kind of story. But well, if you can - good for you (is it?), welcome to the world of adults, lad. It's dark, depressing, smells of piss, regrets and alcohol. But despite the weight of the world, you still will have to press forward, because no one else will...\n\n\nPS: Usually i don't pay a lot of attention to this aspect of many games, but here i just have to mention it specifically and separately - Disco Elysium voice acting (eng. ver) is absolutely GODLY. INSANE. SHIVERS INDUCING. Playing the whole game only to HEAR IT'S VOICE - is a reward in itself. It's just this good, belive me.

And because \"Amnesia\", you can shape him however you want and deal with said trauma in whichever way you want.\n\nI'll briefly mention technical aspects, as the game has options that it doesn't actually need (since it's already optimised so well) and doesn't shit the bed in 2K144fps. Usually even CRPGs can struggle to hit that mark, but this game works like a charm at high resolutions, settings and framerates. The UI scales with resolution too, so, nothing is going to be too big or too small. I've seen games that look worse get even lower framerates. Not that the graphics are next level, but the art style allows it to be somewhat simplistic and still look very visually appealing. And this I very much appreciate.\n\nI can't say there's much to talk about other than having several voices in his head fighting to be the main protagonist, as the game itself is more comprised of rolling those checks and internalising thoughts. Even racism, communism, and other delightful concepts. All of the goodness in the game is story-based, and since I don't want to spoil it, all I can say is that it has genuine messages and stories to tell in such a small amount of time, in a way that is heartily deep...or maybe not so deep depending on who your character is.\nAnd if you're like me, you'll find the most absolute joy with a little voice in your head coaxing you to not only preach communism, but become a full debate-lord to literally everyone you meet. And that itself is hilarious to watch. And choosing that route, the game [i]does[/i] go deep into the political connotations of each ideology it presents. Of course, every other personality is somehow still fleshed out as a character too (even though they're all voices in the main character's head) but I apparently got a kick out of the communism mind gremlin so much that my character's evaluation consisted of being a \"free-market/ultraliberal communist\", with the balancing of said ideas being completely unknown. Gave me a good laugh considering the entire game makes a point to not only split certain ideologies, but oppose them in many ways, with everyone around you being confused as to how you can do more than that.\nI also made my character apologise a lot. A LOT. He was Literally The Sorriest Cop. And that was also amusing.\n\nDespite having so much humour, it also has classic trauma that cuts deep to the point where it could explain any of your psychotic actions, and yet the game still somehow makes me laugh and feel deeply pitiful for our main character at the same time. Very clever story writing indeed.\nI liked the story enough that I didn't want to go get a bad ending like I usually do. There wasn't much more to see, it would be a completely different character and experience. Though I definitely did experiment with other builds just to see the extent of the character building and how important it is, and also may have punched a child. The game made me feel bad for it too. Which is another reason I didn't want to go a bad route, since I usually don't feel bad being 'evil', this game will really make you feel bad.\nAnd with all that, I couldn't recommend the game more.\n\nBriefly mentioning the controversy that you've no doubt seen from other reviews, I don't need to mention it in-depth, other people have already said what I think about it.

In this case, I ran into a bug where I waited till it was dark by reading inside my room with my partner with me, and I went to leave, my partner said goodbye, and unbeknownst to me, this caused the game to glitch meaning I could no longer save, or get autosaves.

Maybe the few moments where the game feels and plays like a point'n click, to the point that it is possible to wander / not know what to do (tip: passing time -by reading books for instance- can help move the story forward). I think that's all. There is some linearity to the story overall, but this was to be expected. Entirely \"dynamic\" narration come with too much complexity. Also replayability is good thanks to the skill system (read below).\n\nEverything else has blown me away.\n\nThe background is a welcome change to the classic sci-fi or heroic fantasy, and there is a lot of lore to get acquainted with through dialog.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively basic: your character comes with attributes + 24 skills (to level up later). Some skill checks are automatic, others are manual (on demand: roll a dice, using the dialog system). The nice thing about this system is that the game feels very balanced. Moreover, you can play almost any kind of character, which will open different solutions and change outcomes. As I mentioned before, although there is linearity to the story, replayability is very high.\n\nThere is more to the skill system I mentioned before: there are researchable passive skills + characterization points that get awarded depending on the choices you make. Over time you can lean towards being a communist or a fascist, a \"sorry cop\" or an \"apocalypse cop\", etc. etc.\nThese points add up over time and make your character somewhat unique.\nI have nothing special to say about graphics/sound/music, they are good and fit the setting.\n\nWhat stands out the most is the top-tier writing. The icing on the cake is complete voice overs for all characters (+ narrator / inner voice).\n\nSo, what character do you want to be ? Good cop ? Sorry cop ? Bad cop ? The choice is yours !

Set in its own universe with many fantastical elements and phenomena, Disco Elysium puts emphasis on its application of 24 \"Furies\"; internal monologues of its protagonist's mental and physical capacities, as you are set to solve a seemingly innocuous lynching. Alongside these 24 skills, which may be increased once per level to help you better pass skill checks that help you to uncover the workings of Martinaise, the game's setting, you find yourself learning its history just as much as your own due to your character's alcohol-induced amnesia. I can't recommend Disco Elysium enough, it's a masterfully written story-driven title that combines stellar wit with genuine emotion and poignant political sentiment, alongside an atmosphere with heart and soul baked into its DNA.\n\nDisco Elysium defies a lot of contemporary RPG hangups by disregarding the all-too-common medium of RPGs that prioritize shooting hordes of enemies; This isn't a game where you find yourself regularly shooting up a town only to throw down a cool [Speech 75] at its final boss to spare him and end the quest \"peacefully\", it's a game where you're going to roll the dice to [b]not[/b] have a mid-life-crisis panic attack because somebody told you to fuck your hat.\n\nDisco earns its hilarity and realism by establishing a world that is down to earth for better or worse; it doesn't feel like a world where real beliefs or cynicism towards those beliefs have been muted to appeal to publishers, wider markets, or to artificially create an alternative human history. Instead, it's able to relish in its political commentaries and ethoses quite literally, and without much metaphor, instead saving analogies of the sort for the world's more supernatural qualities, where it speaks to real-world themes and ideas even more [i]because[/i] it's not literally using a real-world equivalent. Disco Elysium is a world where people say fuck instead of empty made-up slang, and when it [i]does[/i] swear, it doesn't spend any time bragging about it for how radical it is for making its characters say grownup words. Instead, it just feels like a natural utterance, for better or worse. It's a world where people say [i]Communism[/i], [i]Fascism[/i], [i]Centrism[/i], [i]State Monopoly on Violence[/i], [i]Scab[/i] and more, and it earns every usage, because this is a title that is proud and confident in its message, themes, and analyses. It's earnestly refreshing to play a title that just gets it. It's a script with enough confidence to say that its story is what it is, without aspiring to be a heroic narrative where the player faces off against the world, but instead deals with deeply personal and real problems of addiction, loss, and failure in a city that the world (and you) forgot.\n\nDisco Elysium is easily one of the best games in the past decade, disregarding the contemporary tendency for mass amounts of violence being necessary for a roleplaying title to be enjoyable, and instead relying on the strength of its writing, the depth of its world, and an all-consuming wit to portray itself.

It's definitely on the weird end of the spectrum, with the game even telling you that it's OK to be a bit \"out there\" sometimes as you can get away with saying weirder-than-usual things because you're a cop. \n[*]Graphics are okay, nothing really stood out to me but it wasn't bad at all. \n[*]The skill tree isn't your usual set of skills, rather an enourmous set of traits that you can further develop, such as \"Logic\", \"Empathy\" or \"Hand-eye-coordination\". \n[*]There's an \"inner dialogue\" going on all the time which, based on your skills, gives you information about the situation. Sometimes you can deduce something because your rhethoric skill is high enough, but you'd have missed it if you hadn't invested into the skill. This effect counts for all the skills which are very distinct and allows you to build a different main character every playthrough, and you'll get into very different situations.\n[*]Initially the game didn't have voice acting. That was added later and it's incredibly good. It really makes the characters come to life and kept me interested as you can relate to the characters a lot better because of it. \n[*]Throughout the game you're constantly being questioned on your political stance (sometimes in a subtle way, sometimes you're literally being asked) and what \"copotype\" you are, defining the type of cop you are. It's really intriguing becuase it's basically your inner dialogue reflecting onto your virtual (or actual) self, and you can make adjustments in your behaviour if you want to steer your character development elsewhere.\n[/list]\n\n[b]\u274c Cons \u274c[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The emphasis of this game is on it's text. Constantly situations, people and items are being described, as are your own thoughts. Sometimes discussions were so strange that my mind just wandered and skipped through it more than I would have wanted. Not every single dialogue is as interesting as the next one. \n[*]Some decisions are based on the roll of a dice, further affected by context (for example, did you find out something about someone?) and your skills. But when you inevitably fail a roll you can easily revert back to a quicksave and roll the dice again until you win. It feels a little too easy to cheat that way, though the game is best played if you just accept a failed dice roll (you'll never truly get stuck even if you fail in a situation)\n[*]This is a detective game but NOT a puzzle game. Often times these games have puzzle minigames in some way or form embedded into them, but this one does not. I didn't mind that much but I would expect a lot of people that enjoy this genre to expect a puzzle sprinkled in as well. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b]\nDisco Elysium is weird but definitely a game that you'll want to at least experience once. The inner dialogue is amazingly interesting and the story is great. If you can handle a lot of dialogue, definitely consider giving this game a shot!!\n\nWas this review useful to you?

I enjoyed the rpg elements of building my own character with a lot of unique traits, this was an amazing system and I really loved how different it felt, but for me the overall bleakness and heavy political storylines really put me off, especially because I didn't connect with many of the characters so didn't care about various outcomes.

What exactly are you doing with all that time alone, anyway? What is the point? Does any of it add up, or matter? Does it shape who you are, or make you better? Does it make you think?\n\nI've played most of the best-written games you can think of. I was engrossed by Fallout: New Vegas and its factions. I was moved by Kratos as he learned to be a father and real man, a better example of what a man can be. I was absorbed in Pathologic 2, and felt the pain of its message through me. I was drawn in by the search for a daughter in the Witcher 3. And too many more to recount here. Indeed, for the longest time, these games fought in a sort of uneasy tie for my 'favorite game.' \n\nDisco Elysium--which I put off playing for years, in part because I somehow knew it would be a special, truly quality experience--stands head and shoulders above every narrative and mechanical-storytelling accomplishment in any other game I've ever played (and as a nice bonus, it is also, without any close competitors, the [i] funniest game [/i] I've ever played). \n\nI don't think there is another game like Disco Elysium. Disco Elysium is finally seeing the hobby you grew up with growing up with you. It's finally seeing games truly stand among fine literature or great films, with themes that speak to the experience of living as an adult in a complicated world full of conflicting ideologies, all of them vying for you to identify with them.\n\nIt speaks to the confusion and disappointment of living in a world that has so collectively let us down. A haunted world, full of failed promises, the world Mark Fisher succumbed to his own ruin in, and so many others.\n\nMost of all, it spoke to real heartbreak. To feel like you messed up so badly and were so far gone that you might as well take on a new identity. Start over.\n\nOnly you can't, of course. You have to move on from the ruin of whatever has happened to you. Remember the voice of Volition: \"It's not too late. You don't have to do this. You can get through this.\" \n\nAnd, look out for the Kim Kitsuragis in your life, if you're lucky enough to have any (easily one of the best and most endearingly written characters in any game, ever): \"I'm on your side.\"\n\nThese themes all came together to form something so personal it often felt as if it could have been written for me. I suspect the power of this game, however, is that I'm far from the only one who felt that strongly about it. Indeed, it suggests that I was one of very, very many.\n\nI was growing tired of games, struggling to enjoy them like I once did, and increasingly, it didn't feel like the issue was just that I was getting older and had less time for them; I felt like I had just seen and played most all of it, that every tired trope and weary plot beat and gameplay convention had worn themselves out over and over, and again, so many games today come with such a huge time commitment, and for what?\n\nDisco Elysium takes dozens of hours, but every hour is worth it. I don't 'question' my time with this game, don't feel the slightest tinge of guilt for the life poured into it. \n\nIn brief, this is the most important and personally profound game I have ever played, with no peers. \n\nI know I will play it again, and even perhaps again, and again as my life goes on, like revisiting a film that moved you, or a great novel that stirred you--seeing how its shapes and colors reflect in you anew as the days have passed, as you have changed while it awaited your return.\n\nYou can keep coming back to it because it's time spent engaged with art.

When you start, you will pick your main attributes and during your playthrough these attributes and the choices you make will affect future events and what you need to do to progress in the story.\n\nThe graphics and visual style reminded me of a visual novel, the scenarios and environments give the impression of being hand painted, and the in-game art for the characters and abilities have an even more evident artistic flair, and both look great and very original.\n\nThe story and writing were groundbreaking and set a new standard in the industry. The game has a lot of text to read, or listen, since all text is narrated in the final cut of the game, but all of it is interesting and the tone varies from serious and deep considerations about the world and lighter funny comments and situations created by picking the sillier text line. The main quest has a lot of turns and will surprise you, but the side stories are also interesting and give you an idea of how that fantasy world works and a glimpse of the very complex historic events that took place and shaped that world into what you see in the present.\n\nThe sound and voice acting is also top notch and elevate the brilliant writing even more. Some voices in particular are really memorable and will stay with you even after you finish the game. The soundtrack of the game is also phenomenal, meditative and haunting at the same time, and sets the mood of the game, more cheerful in the beginning and more somber afterwards. If you\u2019re curious you can [u][url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7G5nEyQTeA/] check a slowed down version of the OST here[/url][/u].\n\nThe gameplay of the game revolves mostly around two key aspects: the choices you made during the dialog and the skill checks that will allow or block some conversation options, and force you to take a longer route to solve a certain task. Regarding the skill checks, the game has a very complex attribute map with 24 different ones, divided in 4 groups. As you gain experience you'll have points to spend on these skills, but also on concepts that can be internalized in the thought cabinet, which are similar to perks, but keep in mind some are more useful than others, and need to [b]spend points to remove them too.[/b]\n\nThe items you can collect are pieces of clothing that will also increase and decrease your attributes, money to buy new clothing and other things, and medicine that can restore your health and morale if you pick terrible conversation choices. The clothing in particular is essential in raising the success percentage in the skill checks.\n\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b]  \n[b]How many:[/b] 45 Achievements.\n[b]How much time:[/b] Around 40 hours, with a guide for the side quests.\n[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Easy, since you can quicksave and reload as often as you need. The first playthrough will be intimidating but after you learn what are the best attributes and choices, it becomes much easier. Getting [spoiler] the Actual Art Degree perk in the first will give you a boost in experience that makes even Hardcore mode easy.[/spoiler]  There are guides available.\n[b]Achievements\u2019 Difficulty:[/b] Medium. There are a lot of achievements to get and some require raising attributes to very high values, so you need to stock a lot of skill points. The others that might take some effort are the political vision ones. Trying to remain politically balanced and saving skill points until day 3 and making a manual save then will save you some time. In any case, you\u2019ll probably need a guide for some of the more obscure achievements.\n\n\n[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  \nDisco Elysium is one of the best RPGs ever released and it\u2019s a fantastic experience: the story, the world building and OST are phenomenal, but you need to read and/or listen to a lot of text. Even if you don\u2019t want to 100% the game and see every side story the game offers, the main quest alone is worth finishing.\n\n\n[b]Join and follow my group [u][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/42556190-Ribbon-Hunters/] Ribbon Hunters[/url][/u] for more suggestions and reviews of easy indie games to get all the achievements.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1693160192, "timestamp_updated": 1693609539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544642865657806396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124750106": {"recommendationid": "124750106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994013400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2177, "last_played": 1669645537}, "language": "english", "review": "shame for what you've done", "timestamp_created": 1667267143, "timestamp_updated": 1667267143, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544600844383239746", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139844700": {"recommendationid": "139844700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018793570", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1235, "last_played": 1687337567}, "language": "english", "review": "Broke my neck in a nodding contest. 10\\10", "timestamp_created": 1686415538, "timestamp_updated": 1686415538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544569849967956543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137296041": {"recommendationid": "137296041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040986943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3341, "last_played": 1652326181}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, however do not buy it to avoid supporting the fraud scum who are stealing money from the rightful developers.", "timestamp_created": 1682458613, "timestamp_updated": 1682458613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544445335865020752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124774866": {"recommendationid": "124774866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072676272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1171, "last_played": 1672179169}, "language": "english", "review": "A true masterpiece.

But this game even has a ton of voice acting which is just *Chef's kiss*. Almost everything a character says in this game is quotable, either for being funny or just plain weird... and also funny. \n\nThe overall theme is dark and I have no idea what kind of people I want to side with. I have ADD (Attention Deficit Syndrome), so I cannot remember anything anyone says. I instantly forget things, it just goes in my mind, gets processed, but then gets flushed out. Or sometimes it doesn't even get processed. So trying to understand all the political stuff in this game is very hard. Different NPCs have different opinions. Some people are obsessed with what I would consider communism - everyone working hard and being equal - while other people seem to be more interested in a democracy system.\n\nThe characters are very well made and all very memorable. I love Garte and the voice for him sounds very familiar. Cuno and the other children are just annoying demonspawn. I am not religious, but I think Cuno is definitely the antichrist. An absolute waste of sperm and a living mistake. The children remind me of stereotypes of youth in England (Like almost everyone in the game, they have an English accent and talk like English youth stereotypes). \n\nThe gameplay is very nice. I'm not sure if there's a time limit. I sure as hell hope not - I like taking my time. I love just interacting with everything and getting an infinite supply of lore just everywhere and trying to use every dialogue option. I love that you can create a build for yourself in the beginning and there's funny descriptions of every kind of personality traits. This game is dark, interesting and also funny.\n\nAlright, the only thing I dislike is some of the UI (menus, not in game) is not great on my eyes. It hurts to look at some of the menus - not all of them, generally the UI is actually good but it's not that pleasant to look through the menus and it causes me to not really know what I'm doing. So I just think it needs to look more pleasant somehow. \n\nThere is also not enough autosaves. I completed and accepted a lot of missions and then died from looking deep into the mouth of some dead guy.\n[hr][/hr]\nTLDR: This is an amazing isometric detective game with cool mechanics including a chance system, selectable and upgradable personality traits and different choices to make. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691543991, "timestamp_updated": 1691559276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543521225452423096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138163193": {"recommendationid": "138163193", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978376856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1683952197}, "language": "english", "review": "NO BUY, ONLY PLAY", "timestamp_created": 1683852997, "timestamp_updated": 1683852997, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543379008769989014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135017793": {"recommendationid": "135017793", "author": {"steamid": "76561199182983973", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2394, "last_played": 1677801759}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.

Why? Because it proves the modern era does not have to abandon quality of writing, and it proves this with abundance.\n\nI don't frankly care about combat, so for me it sits at #2 with Planescape sitting at #1. This game really isn't even worse than Planescape, it just doesn't have the strength of setting (and not for lack of trying, it's just hard to compete with quite literally the most profoundly weird yet thematically relevant setting ever crafted)\n\nIt's hard to even quantify what this game gets right. Philosophically it is drenched. It allows room to ask just about every question, and lets you as the player pick which of the questions you want to ask. And I don't just mean dialogue relevant questions, I mean existential, political, overwhelming questions. It allows you to establish any flag of politics you like, or none at all. It allows you to look inwardly, or reject the inner dogma and remain external. It allows you so, so, SO much room as a player.\n\nI frankly hate that it exists. As a writer and prospective game dev of my own making, this game existing is an affront. It is simply without flaw in a lot of ways, and yet it does so while constantly pushing the envelope. Most of the time when you create something so beautiful you avoid the profound because profundities are difficult, opaque, covered in bramble. But that didn't matter, dive in and hold on. The very first sentences of the game are an internal monologue set against your organs, against your psyche, against your schemas of self. They did not fear an ounce of what they wrote. And that is the most powerful statement any writer could ever make.\n\nA lot of the dissent on this game (what little there is but it is there) isn't totally invalid. There is no combat, some hate that fact. It is NOT however a visual novel, anyone who says otherwise conflates interactivity with \"Can I combat\" which is reductive and stupid. The RPG mechanics on this game are extremely intentional and thorough. You will not have the same playthrough with the same dialogue choices but with a different set of skills. It may not be readily apparent, but there are tons and tons of skill checking under and over the hood. This game rewards multiple playthroughs so heavily that it laughs and spits at developers who make two dialogue options lead to the same result. One playthrough is not long, so it may surprise you how much is actually written in this game until you understand that fact. If you desperately need to click or press the murder button(s) then look elsewhere. But if you think there isn't gameplay to be had here, then I don't think the meat of this game is for you anyway. I hate to be a \"You're too dumb\" type of person, but seriously this viewpoint is so stupidly shortsighted.\n\nThis game is not for everyone. Naturally. It's a specific, niche game no matter how good it is. But to say the game itself is flawed because of incorrect perceptions is just frustrating beyond belief.\n\nThe politics of this game are unfortunate, as the other reviews say pirate the game where possible.

I loved every moment of it! Discovering the world and learning about its vast history with Harry kept me awestruck; learning about it from multiple biased sources, as well as the voices inside my head, kept me questioning everything at all times.

I could sit here on a soap box preaching my beliefs all day, but those are my beliefs. I love this game, but what ZA/UM did to Robert Kurvitz and his team deeply saddens me. A part of me hopes the rumors of a sequel are false, and ZA/UM lets the game rot away, its memory to fade away to be overtaken by the ever-encroaching Pale. But recent events tell me otherwise.

Also, I don't intend to give spoilers for those who haven't tried the game.\n\nFirst, it will be a sad classic, but Disco Elysium is a must-try masterpiece. Even if you don't want to support the company because of the recent drama, find a alternative way to play it.\n\nAs for my comments about the game: It's more like an interactive novel than a game. With its endless options, \nYou will find yourself in a sad? but soulful world that draws you in. Each character in the game, especially the main character, has a unique structure that attracts people. To be honest, some of the characters were so original that I was very eager to interact with them more, but i must say, the game let me down with that. Each character is so empathetic that you can't love any of them purely or hate any of them to death. (There are one or two cute exceptions.) Every character has an opinion about life, a story from life, an ideology to defend one way or another, things they like, and fears. While some characters allow you to touch their souls due to their characters (and of course they touch your soul too), some cannot even tolerate you watching from afar. Hell, Even the uncommunicative characters who only stand to be crowded can attract attention. It has more successful characters than I have seen in any game for a long time. In fact, Don't be fooled by the thing that the game is a detective game. Yes, the game is really about detective work, but the main focus of the game is about characters. I'm not even talking about the protagonist. Even though the character is shaped according to your decisions, he has unchangeable features from the past and these things make the character so magical that I don't know how to describe it. As someone who has never had a drink for religious reasons in his life, it was a unique experience for me to go on a journey in the inner world of an alcoholic who is fed up with life.\n\nSpeaking of the protagonist, the character's skill tree and abilities' functions have a uniqueness to the dnd style that I haven't personally experienced before. (I just got a little tabletop dnd experience) According to the skill points you give, the character almost puts another person into your soul, understands what is going on around him in different ways, and speaks with this new view in the form of internal dialogue. Sometimes, if you've upgraded a few abilities too much, several different abilities may argue among themselves. The real people around you also notice the situations you are in and react to you. The functions of abilities are so deep that after finishing the Game for the first time, I played it once again to see what I would encounter with other abilities. What brings the game to that special place in my heart is definitely the unique characters brought by this skill system.\n\nI really like the map design. They have definitely succeeded in giving the city they want to give their soul to. There are many things to discover, witness, help, and enjoy. Not to mention that each venue has its own special music. When you sit down and dive into the music and the visuals of the game, you find yourself in a different world. Of course, the game's unique visual scheme should also be praised. It's Graphic design is an absolute joyful thing that really reflects the emotions that the game is trying to make you feel.\n\nIf you think you will enjoy experiencing a good psychological novel, please give this game a try. It will change your perspective on life at some point.\n\nSunrise, Parabellum.", "timestamp_created": 1671339336, "timestamp_updated": 1671363018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

'game' is /certainly/ a revolutionary work of art. As in, somehow this 'game' itself deserves its own entire real museum, dedicated to the story of how it was created, the players who played it and their stories... this... this 'game' is barely within my capability to describe.\n\nIt forces me to entirely reconsider ... literal basic assumptions I have about /grammar/ itself.\n\nThe... quite literally the only previous works of art in my own personal life that have caused this level of radical and systemic reassessment of everything that I /think/ that I know to be how ... to describe how literally anything works?\n\nThis game to me is the equivalent of something like \"Everyone, before they reach age 16, should read 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451.\"\n\nThis game is as fundamentally transformational of the entire concept of /what even actually is a video game/ as ... literally Deus Ex.\n\nEvery single piece of in game art is a lovingly crafted impressionistic brilliant achievement. The contextual usage of these art pieces is ... sublime. Perfect? Not sure if I /can ever be ok with using that word seriously, but I apparently lack any other word to describe this./\n\nRight, to me, this game ... just ... the art style alone, is as beautiful as the scene in Doctor Who... where literally Van Gogh himself... a tortured soul in his own life, never given any credit and in fact mocked and laughed at in his own life time... The Doctor brings him into our time, where he ... essentially is incapable of understanding that simply a few centuries later, it is the common understanding that he himself was one of the most influential, most studied, most inspired and inspiring artists in all of the entire history of Western Europe.\n\n/That scene where the Doctor explains this is just the same reality he is from, but forward in time a bit... and ... Van Gogh finally experiences actual happiness?/\n\nThat is the only way I can even attempt to describe /the art direction of this game alone/.\n\nI do not currently have the mental capacity to adequately describe the beyond masterful use of words, dialogue, perspective framing and shifting, subject/object anarchy as a functional tool of the narrative and the gameplay itself...\n\nThis game is literally revolutionary. In essentially every way you can possibly interpret that sentence.\n\nSimply outstanding.\n\nIMMEDIATE UPDATE:\n\nNo sooner had I wrote these words obviously celebrating the literal genuis of the actual creators... than I read the review of the game by Kaithe.\n\nHorrifically perfect.

Also, the English voice acting is top notch.\n\nFinally, the game mechanics are interesting and a mixture of point and click mechanics and randomised dice throw mechanics, for which your stats are important (hence the rpg element).\n\nI would absolutely recommend this gem to everyone who likes a thrilling story and lively characters!\n\nMy final score is 96 %.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677618664, "timestamp_updated": 1677618664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130871233": {"recommendationid": "130871233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071938048", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1440, "last_played": 1673748371}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best 'unique' games I've played in a while.\n\nDisco Elysium is a game purely based on stellar voice acting, interesting characters and an engaging mystery to unravel.\nThere is zero, and i mean it, zero action in this game. It is all done through clicking around the game world to move and reading/listening to character dialogue.\n\nBut all of that was perfect.\n\nOne of the few games where I've actually just sat back and listened to character dialogue instead of reading the text and skipping. I cannot think of a game that rivals this one in its voice acting prowess. My best advice would be to take your time. Enjoy the world and story unravelling in front of you. Do not rush anything. You can achieve it all.\n\nThe RPG aspect of this game is very unique. I can confidently say for the first time about any game that there truly is no 'wrong build'. A lot of games advertise that their game is *truly* free form and that any skill is viable but none of those hold a candle to the DiscoElysium style. It's hard to describe but it becomes very straightforward after a few hours of levelling up.\n\nIt can get a bit tedious after getting presented with walls of text after walls of text but thats why i think this game is best played in short bursts, spaced out over a long period; not too dissimilar to a book.\n\nI think thats the best way to describe this game, an interactive book. The amount of exposition, character development and world building is sometime i've not seen in other games, ever. \n\nDisco Elysium has truly captured lightning in a bottle in its perfect little niche. Its funny, quirky, charismatic, sad and introspective. You'd be a fool to give it a miss. If only I could wipe my brain and do it all again\n\np.s you can roleplay as your favourite political ideology too!\n\n\n\nEDIT: It's been a good few months since I finished this game and I can't stop thinking about it. I wake up in cold sweats with the foreboding fear that no game, no other art medium will be able to capture the feeling I had when playing this game.\n\nSo the thing I keep thinking about is, was it worth it to be happy for a little bit, even though it ended up sad?\n\n Is it better to have love and lost than to never have loved at all?\n\nHarrier Du Bois.

I cannot exaggerate the impressiveness and the depth of the storyline, characters and setting that make up this incredible title. It is a benchmark for excellence as far as world-building is concerned, and the agency it affords the player in sculpting the protagonist is extremely refreshing.\n\nAn extremely-dialogue driven RPG set in the fictional city of Revachol, Disco Elysium sees you as a disgraced police detective seemingly arousing from the worst day of his life. With no memory of his identity, no recollection of his mission, and no context to the world around him, it is up to the player to decide who this man is and what he will become as he attempts to solve a murder in a lawless ghetto besieged by imminent class war.\n\nEvery single question could have consequence, every action can concern a potential ally. Submit to every vice around you and stumble through the case as a broken detective spiralling into madness, or go cold-turkey and turn this mystery around as a super-cop rising from the ashes of your old life like a phoenix?

I played it mostly after work, a few hours here and there, and found it only mildly addicting. What kept me going, was my brain not letting go of my detective\u2019s quests and my fear that I'd get unnecessarily stuck if I returned to the game after a longer break.\n\nThe biggest advantage of the game is the complex storytelling, the biggest weakness - it's mechanics. The mechanics boil down to a [b]point-and-click adventure with miles of (very well written) dialogue[/b]. In its simplicity, the game could have been released on mobile and its gaming experience would not fall short. I played it with a game controller, but a keyboard is an equally good choice. Disco Elysium could probably even be played on an e-book reader, was it ever released on one.\n\nThe storytelling is hugely impressive from the very beginning of the game when you pick your character. You can pick between predefined characters - either \"brainiac\", \"heart driven\" or \"muscle\" - or design your own by choosing between 4 skill sets. Each skill has its own story that describes it in a [b]playfully scientific, kind of poetic and refreshingly entertaining way[/b]. Every skill has a disadvantage! So choose wisely, if you want that sober logic, that will detach you from human emotions. Fun fact: certain skills will give you contradicting clues later in the game.\n\nAnother fun but not entirely thought through game aspect is the thought cabinet. It allows you to boost certain skills or unlock new abilities - but it doesn't tell you which ones. Considering the big costs of each thought (precious experience point & long game time), the [b]thoughts are kept unnecessarily vague[/b], which tempts the player to search for a solution online, rather than in game. I find it very disappointing that for the thought cabinet the game creators chose a highly obfuscated storytelling, that makes it impossible to guess what each thought changes about my character.\n\nI designed my detective as an \u201cdexterous brainiac\u201d and set out to [b]solve the mystery of a hanged man[/b]. It didn't take me long to die of my first heart attack (after looking at a postcard \ud83d\udc94). I lost one partner \ud83d\ude3f but recruited another one!\ud83e\udee1 I conversed with a praying mantis like monster, a goddess, and a corpse. I failed all my flirtation attempts, but investigated a hole in the universe and provided a business plan to a light bending billionaire. You get the gist \ud83d\ude02 Your detective\u2019s path could be quite different though, and that's ok. \n\nWhen you progress in the game, your quest log will accumulate more and more entries that are only organized by in-game days of the week. This was mildly annoying, as I couldn't distinguish between the main and side quests and keep track of the details I needed to investigate. Towards the end of the game, however, I realized that [b]all quests are \"main\" \ud83d\udcad[/b] Depending on which quests you choose to solve and how, you will steer the game towards one of many endings.\n\nOn a personal note, kudos to the creators for placing a good bunch of Polish references in the game.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who wants to intellectually explore a new world at their own pace. The game can be played with limited hand-eye-coordination, without haste or tension. [b]It will be as fun as you allow it to be[/b] - choose neutral dialogue options, get boring answers. Choose silly dialogues, expect silly outcomes.

Don't really know anything about it, so I guess pirate away or whatever. Definitely, gonna add and edit to this later on.\n\nI think anyone at all who is an avid reader or just wants to try something plain different from the typical menu of games like an FPS should play Disco Elysium. A lot of games talk about the \"experience\" of the game and the like, but this game? Disco Elysium really is an experience.\n\n-Edit: Disco Elysium aims to emulate a quintessential human experience. The game can be at times not all realistic all the way through, deeply surreal even, but the emotion and the people feel nonetheless real. The game depicts understandable loss and poverty, people struggle, the socioeconomic situation is pretty bad, yet there are plenty of weird funnies sprinkled across the confusing shit show. There are moments of reprieve, extreme stress, sadness, hilarity, amazing awe. Nothing feels forced, nothing feels out of place. In fact, the game doesn't force you to do anything really. If you fail to do something or you forget, then whoops, that's done and you just carry on (unless you go to a different save). Because that's life, that's real, the game is all about the Protagonist character trying to figure it all out as he goes and desperately trying to understand and not mess it all up.\n\nThe game is extremely well written and accompanied by the voice acting, its not at all difficult to be immersed in the full sensory experience in your mind. Not to mention, the protagonist's thoughts and senses are constantly talking to him so you can really feel like you're seeing everything through his eyes. Great sound design and music as well, there are lots of little rustic noises and sounds from analogue machines. The visuals of the game make it feel like your walking around on a water coloured painting world, which is quite cool and really adds to the ambience of the game's time period. It's like things are becoming watered down and smudged, or that the world is more like a memory of a world than it is one. \n\nAdmittedly, the game is quite short, but this is all about the quality over quantity on this one plus you can always replay it with different strategies and choices. The only two problems I had with the game were one, I could never figure out how to toggle on for my character to run. Sometimes, if I clicked he'd run and other times I'd have to hold shift. It wasn't too much of a problem, but definitely annoying. The second was a small bug where it was really difficult to use consumable items placed in your hands. You'd have to move your cursor around pixel hunting to see the button light up. There are occasionally moments where the game's dialogue programming fails and some of the audio doesn't play or a different dialogue is used but I think I only encountered those moments a handful of times.", "timestamp_created": 1678974308, "timestamp_updated": 1682176408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528971970081329346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131159725": {"recommendationid": "131159725", "author": {"steamid": "76561199002786824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1322, "last_played": 1674150012}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a rather grudging thumbs up from me.

I'm happy to change that stance as and when it's fixed, but there's currently an issue that makes you \"locked\" into conversations after an npc moves and you cannot move/do anything - Even quit. It's not too bad on it's own, but throw in a game that uses die-rolls and chance as it's primary mechanic and it gets very frustrating when you pass a check, only to have it crash, and then only work when you've unfortunately loaded for the 8th time but this one is failed. It's irritating, and took me out of the experience often. I also dislike some other quality of life bugs I've seen - for example, the white check skill passes in your journal being there long after the interaction is gone (for example, the warded door physical check when you've already opened it with a key from the bookpeddler). These issues aren't game-ruining so far and haven't caused me to stop playing, and that's entirely because the game itself is brilliant, and is in my opinion worth the hassle of the bugs. But they've been here a long time according to the forums, and I feel a piece of media you pay money for shouldn't have these issues in the \"final cut\" and assumedly very end product for a game that's been out 3 years. \n\nAdding to this, personal-opinion wise, I entered this game in the wrong mindset. I didn't expect it to be so heavy on politics, and the game sometimes forces you to pick a side (trust me, there's some without the \"boring cop\" prompt listed, forcing you to have an opinion on it). And I largely play games for escapism as a break from our own real-world politics being garbage.

The crumpled, exposition-dumping, ex machina-esque, none-of-your decisions-or-actions-actually-mattered-type ending was a bit of a letdown, but it was still okay. \n\n2. The decision to create a completely fictional world for the game was a mistake. The writers clearly had absolutely no idea how physics, chemistry, history or evolution work, so they inserted a near-facsimile of real-world human society into a fictional world with rules that make such a society -- heck, even our species -- utterly impossible. The technobabble, if you're not a complete moron, will hurt your brains.\n\nThose two are probably my biggest gripes with the game. Also, as the list of cons says, the game has no replay value. You can quite easily cover maybe 97% of the content in a single playthrough, albeit it will be a lengthy one, well over 50 hours, if you reload at a few key moments and also play with all dialogue voiced and listen to everything, which I highly recommend. Not a problem in my book, but given the game's unique role-playing mechanics, seems like a design failure.\n\nTo summarize, do get it. And DO give it an honest go.

Just need to get this out of my head. This is not going to be a detailed review into Disco Elysium's themes and political statements nor will it discuss it's systems in any detail. This is just a raw review of my feelings after playing. \n\nAt a glance, Disco Elysium is definitely not a game for someone like me. I hate politics and hate the thought of not completing or \"missing out\" on something in anything, including videogames. Looking back on it, I still feel an immense sense of missing out when I look at all the branches of the story that I missed... But that's OK. Disco Elysium is not about completing everything in a single playthrough, you simply can't. It's, as cheesy at it sounds, about the journey you as a character goes on based on the choices you make. It's about the adventures you have and characters you make friends with along the way. Your choices reflect your experience and what you missed. \n\nThe world of Disco Elysium is malincholic and beaten down, an aftermath of war and corruption, much like our own world and that's what makes it so intriguing. It mirrors our own struggles and makes us empathetic to the world's characters. It's a world I definitely would not want to be in but can't take my mind off of.\n\nThe visuals of the game are charming and unique, looking like a Renaissance painting. The mese en scene of the game is absolutely perfect and precise at doing it's job of putting you into this world and making you believe in it. The games weather system adds to this realism as well as adds atmosphere and drama to the world. This world, much like our own, might be dull and malincholic at times but if you explore, you'll experience it's true beauty. The lighting, in particular, of this game adds breathtaking beauty and awe to the world at times. \n\nThe characters of the game are all realistic and alive with personality. They are all a result of the world around them which makes the whole world and all the characters feel real. They are not all the same as they all have their own quirks and ways of dealing with the depressing world around them. The dialoge you find yourself having with them is witty, funny, and sad. It's believable which is something I will keep stressing. You'll value every little interaction you have. The occupants of this world will make you care for and believe in this malincholic, hopeful, and beautiful beaten down world of Disco Elysium.\n\nThe music of the game is simply hypnotizing and really draws you into the world. Each track is carefully placed to illicit certain emotions at just the right time and without you really realizing it... You begin to associate certain feelings with certain areas of the world. From the calm respite of the whirling in rags interior music to the malincholic and defeated recesses of your characters mind, the music serves to guide your emotions and increase them tenfold. There's a moment, where the music really gives you the feeling of the world, that stuck with me.  You step outside of the whirling in rags for the first time... experiencing the world you will be living in for the next 20 or so hours... And the song \"Instrument of Surrender\" hits you. It sums up this entire, depressing world full of its beaten down yet hopeful occupants. The beautiful trumpets drone on and a beautifuly sad violen comes in. That's what the city of Revachol is really. It's beautiful... beautiful and sad, yet full of hope...and you almost immediately want to save it. The music in this game will stick with me more than anything else. \n\nThere's so much more I still want to talk about. But like the game and life itself.. I'm going to be satisfied with the experience and closure of writing what I can. Disco Elysium tells the story of a man that has failed himself and who the world has failed as well. As the player you most likely put yourself in his shoes and want to take this second chance he is given and make a success out of it. What you choose might not change the ending much but your experience in getting to the inevitable end will differ. This game along with it's ingenious systems asks you things about yourself - the way you think and choose what your actions are, that you would never have asked and, as a result it changes you. It's not about \"gaming\" the world and \"completing\" everything. It's about how you deal with the world and it's characters, and everything upto what aspect of your character you choose to put points into determines your experiences. It's about looking back and seeing yourself reflected in the face of your character. So when the title of the game stares you in the face and the credits roll you should ask yourself. \n\nWhat kind of cop was I?", "timestamp_created": 1683525958, "timestamp_updated": 1683569005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134131243": {"recommendationid": "134131243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050726837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1539, "last_played": 1678032669}, "language": "english", "review": "HARDCORE!", "timestamp_created": 1678032987, "timestamp_updated": 1678032987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133681964": {"recommendationid": "133681964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003309096", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1622, "last_played": 1687924097}, "language": "english", "review": "CODE 31 OFFICER IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE ON THE DANCE FLOOR", "timestamp_created": 1677432695, "timestamp_updated": 1677432695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559101581573486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133600006": {"recommendationid": "133600006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057344186", "num_games_owned": 492, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 4107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4091, "last_played": 1679069011}, "language": "english", "review": "YeaaaaaaaaaaaaH Hardcore to the MAX!\n\nEDIT: Fucking Collage mode update ...

The game also deals with some heavy real-world topics such as class struggles, racism, drug use, etc.\n\nThe gameplay is quite light on traditional CRPG elements which makes this game easy to pickup. There are a number of base attributes that add to dialogue checks, as well as which provide situational insights that can aid you in interrogation or analysing clues. Your character can also think about different topics which provide passive bonuses to these attributes over time and further shape the character's opinion of various subjects.\n\nThe game has a memorable soundtrack, with certain tracks that could become ear worms that would play in your mind on loop even after you quit the game.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a must try for any RPG fans.", "timestamp_created": 1696196595, "timestamp_updated": 1696196595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146733047": {"recommendationid": "146733047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048979596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4443, "last_played": 1646606462}, "language": "english", "review": "It's absolutly masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1695325861, "timestamp_updated": 1695325861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145289762": {"recommendationid": "145289762", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996185240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1678, "last_played": 1693351366}, "language": "english", "review": "\u00c9s mel!", "timestamp_created": 1693351454, "timestamp_updated": 1693351454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144998154": {"recommendationid": "144998154", "author": {"steamid": "76561199151427179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3155, "last_played": 1669246663}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1692980665, "timestamp_updated": 1692980665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143408486": {"recommendationid": "143408486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149537307", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3230, "last_played": 1677284868}, "language": "english", "review": "Unpopular political opinion: My man Harry fuckin' Yoinky Sploinky on that Stage!", "timestamp_created": 1691177887, "timestamp_updated": 1691177887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143239020": {"recommendationid": "143239020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119258726", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1691087125}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Ah, fuck it.

If the politics annoy you, grow up. If dying to something funny annoys you, grow up. Don't spoil your chances of playing a genre-defining, genre-reviving masterpiece just because you're annoyed that the game doesn't agree with all of your opinions. This is a once in a generation spark of genius - don't waste it because you're so up yourself with your own political opinions. This game lambasted me for my politics from 5 mins in all the way until the end, but being older than 12 - I'm willing to have my beliefs challenged.\n\nIn a post-Skyrim world where Bethesda released an action game masquerading as an RPG so popular that it changed what people think an RPG is, this game is the Jesus figure to show us all the light. Bethesda brought in a new and twisted crowd to the RPG scene who expect RPGs to be heavy on the action and with absolutely no option for actual character progression, conflict, interesting dialogue or the genre-titular \"Role Playing\". \nWhile a few good RPGs have come out in the last 15 years, they have never been commercially successful and for the most part they are either remakes, reimaginings, sequels or spiritual sequels to 90's games. (Except the excellent work coming from Larian - keep trucking my dudes).\n\nDisco Elysium is a game that could only have started with the developers stepping back and asking what people actual like in an RPG. What makes RPGs different from other games. Why is it that Skyrim feels like you are inhabiting the soul of a god whose destiny and every action is predetermined and without consequence, but Shadowrun - Dragonfall feels like you are playing the life of a character whose life you can mould to your liking.\n\nThis is pretty much the only game that had me changing my playstyle not because of my character build or a tough boss or some youtube strategy. I changed my playstyle gradually through the game because the game was developing the character of the main character, your partner, the city you explore and inescapably developing you as you play. \n\nIf you are a fan of RPGs and those RPGs include something not developed by Bethesda, EA or CDPR, buy this game. You will love it. And if you don't love it, then at least you have found out that you don't like RPGs as much as you like aRPGs with a story - in which case go play Divine Divinity.\n\nWhile not flawless, this is one of the very few games I can give a 10/10. The attention to detail in the design of this game is absolutely phenomenal. Not only did they deconstruct the cop story and the amnesia opening, they deconstructed the entire concept of an RPG, and using that they have built one of the most complex RPGs every created and which will take possibly another decade for another game to even come close.", "timestamp_created": 1690625017, "timestamp_updated": 1690625017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547444820404053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139881279": {"recommendationid": "139881279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441446694", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 958, "last_played": 1686574492}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10, never played a game before that made me rethink the way I act in the world.

The text you will encounter matches the literary quality of actual novels, so it\u2019ll feel pretty different from your everyday visual novel.\n\nAt its core, the story surrounds one mystery surrounding a hanging body but make no mistake, this is no whodunit. The journey is every bit if not more important than the destination. Again, it\u2019s well-written, and does a good job of introducing crucial, yet seemingly irrelevant details that get contextualized over time. There\u2019s quite a bit that\u2019s not blatantly obvious, and it\u2019s refreshing to read.\n\nThe game, if it can be called that, is merely walking around and interacting with various people and objects. You have stats that you can allocate to make your character more adept in different ways of collecting information. One thing that should be made clear is that just because it\u2019s a mystery game, doesn\u2019t mean that full sending in intelligence is necessarily the best way of going through the game. There are a ton of hidden stat checks that can offer a surprising amount of info depending on what you\u2019ve specced into. Basically, follow your heart and pick what you want.\n\nOne final point is that the game can often be political, heavy, and sometimes controversial. There may be characters you vehemently despise because of how they act and what they believe in, but in a way it makes the world feel more real. Society is full of people that clash in every way possible, yet somehow we make it work. It\u2019s clear that the game is encouraging you to at least hear everyone out, no matter who they are.\n\nIf you had the attention span to read the entirety of this or other long reviews, you\u2019ll likely be fine with the amount of text the game has. It\u2019s also fully voiced, and voice acting is top notch. Disco Elysium uses the freedom given by the medium of games to give us one hell of a story.

Not quite a retro parallel world, nor a dystopian retro-future, nor a near fantasy. No. Disco Elysium is very much its own world. Inhabited by people very much like people here, in situations not unlike some faced by millions around the real world. It is a political commentary that doesn\u2019t say anything, an adventure where you don\u2019t explore, a complex pattern of interwoven threads that is blank and simple. Though what DE is, at its heart, is a detective story where you both solve the mystery, and decide who the detective is through your actions. \n\nYou play the detective. A genius, a bruiser, a megastar super cop, a drug taking walking corruption, or just a regular detective out to solve cases and go home for the night\u2026 you chose. The world is enough like our own you\u2019ll be at home, and is a pot set to boil over with political turmoil, the centre of which, as far as you are concerned, is the murder in the midst of a strike.  \n\nThe game is laid out in a topdown isometric RPG, original baldurs gate style, the character can be equipped with various items which affect the many skills used to interact with people and objects around the world. The game also has a unique \u2018ideas tree\u2019 which can internalise lessons learned around the game for extra effects. These ideas can also be forgotten with skill points. \n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] An interesting range of options based on political philosophy and world views. Which offers some interesting replayability options to see what changes in the world and how that might alter the outcome. \n[*] An unflinching and interesting world. The world in DE is rich and complicated. Good people can do bad things for ambiguous or contradictory reasons, and bad people can do good things to further their own ambitions, but they\u2019re all very [i]human[/i]. Sad, desperate, or driven, and so very, very, human. It is also very much its own, with a rich history, interesting lore, and very different struggles to our own. I sincerely hope that they build more games in this world. \n[*] A mostly well written story, or at the very least an interesting tapestry woven from the threads of the different characters. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] While they\u2019ve done the best that they can, the dialogue system just isn\u2019t designed to express the range and breadth of human emotions and intentions. I found myself needing to save before every conversation, because I could never tell if the sentences I picked were delivered as intended. For example I read several sections to be quite dry and possibly sarcastic or entrapping, but they were intended seriously.  \n[*] The game has trouble tracking what I did, when, and with whom, as at the end I was reported to have been drinking and chain smoking throughout the game, while I had had precisely one drink and one cigarette, both outside of the presence of the time I was with Kim. \n[*] Conversations were also servery bugged, with new options not appearing, answers leading to different follow-up\u2019s, hanging with options not appearing at all (crashing the game), and situations where a conversation byte just repeated over and over until the conversation ended. It was MOST annoying.\n[*] DE [i]requires[/i] you to do specific things. Which is most irritating. For example I did not wish to work with either of the political factions, but doing so is a prerequisite for other things to occur, as those involve characters which cannot be encountered without the faction\u2019s specific input. This lack of \u2018space\u2019 to solve the case as I wished irritated me, and forced me down specific quest paths I had previously not intended to follow. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] More map points, and the ability to use the map from inside locations. Seriously. Why no points at lands\u2019 end, or the ruins, or the end of the docks, or the various other buildings? Why bother with the map at all if it\u2019s going to be so restrictive?\n[*] Story mode. The urge to save-scum is huge in this game, especially on the first play through, a story mode without checks to progress (but keep them as raw targets for additional dialogue etc) and get the \u2018best possible\u2019 outcomes for everything would make the skill based system more interesting in subsequent playthroughs, in my opinion. \n[*] Alternative ways to get things, go to places, stay in places. The game feels very directed at points and very open in others. \n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]\n\nThis game is super targeted at me. Strong narrative, interesting characters, fascinating options, murky and morally grey problems, all set in a very understandable world a little too like our own for comfort.\n\nThis game may not be for people who are sensitive, especially people sensitive to the implied effects of assault (both physical and sexual), child abuse/neglect, corruption, substance abuse, or the morale choices faced by desperate and angry people. This game will make people of strong political affiliation face morale questions that are counter to their paradigm, which may cause discomfort. This goes for both left and right, though I didn\u2019t see much in the way of authoritarian vs democratic orientation discussion.\nThis game is for walking simulator/decision simulator people, as there are no combat mechanics. It is aimed at, and very much for, people who enjoy complex worlds and difficult questions, though it is oversimplified. This game is for people who enjoy the morally grey, and exploring and investigating. \n\nThis game could be for people who are suffering depression, the bleak world and the bleak options sing to me, a character waking up from a drug and booze filled binge he used to literally wipe his own memory, who has to \u2018face the music\u2019 afterwards reminds me such pursuits are holdovers and temporary escapes that could make things so much worse. There is always space to spiral downwards. It was cathartic to play through. But that is very much my own subjective experience. \n\nSo yeah, I recommend, but maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m just that disco.", "timestamp_created": 1695146441, "timestamp_updated": 1695205407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146523099": {"recommendationid": "146523099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063795978", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 32, "playtime_at_review": 1857, "last_played": 1695449408}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best and most memorable games I have ever played.

And he\u2019s chill as balls.\"\n\nOr, um, maybe not. That was probably my slightly overactive savoire faire talking. Or possibly the booze and drugs. Sadly, the rest of what's left of my fractured personality keeps telling me that \"You really dropped the ball mate. Four point six billion people - and you failed every single one of them. You really *fucked up*.\" \n\nWell, it was a nice dream while it lasted...\n\nThe important thing to understand about DE is that it's basically a point and click adventure game, just with stat checks rather than puzzles. It is, to be fair, a very good point and click adventure game, with great world building, great writing and great voice acting. Play your cards right and you'll not only be a superstar cop, but many many other things. A crypto fascist race theorist.... A pseudo communist philosopher of the people. Or even an connoisseur, a critic and an... *art* cop. Who talks and trades art with people so rich they... bend light. \n\nBut, yeah, you basically click on the map to make your character walk to a point, click on items to inspect them, and then click on NPCs to talk to them. At which point you click on different lines of text. A lot of different lines of text. Like, a huge amount... Occasionally, there's a dice roll, pitting your statistics against a difficulty check. But that's about it. Well, that and a lot of political theory, philosophising and entroponetic science.\n\nAlthough it's billed as a \"ground breaking RPG\" don't expect it to play like an \"rpg\" in the sense of a traditional, isometric crpg where you level your character up, equip them with shiny gear and go solve quests by smacking stuff over the head with it. Even one like Planescape Torment. There's no combat or anything like that. You walk around (a lot), read descriptions of things and engage in dialogue. Or, indeed, internal dialogue. \n\nIf you like point and click adventure games or you want to try something a bit different, it's a great game. I felt it probably would have been better with a bit more... mystery - it felt more Guybrush Threepwood than Gabriel Knight at times if that means anything to you. But there's enough depth to the crime to keep you wanting to probe and probably way more background and world building than you'll ever want. \n\nIf you don't though, you may get bored. These sorts of games were huge in the 1990s but the world's moved on a bit since then. Indeed, I couldnt help but wonder as I played it that maybe I had too. I just want a bit more... \"gameplay\" in my game now. While I enjoyed it, I had to be in the right mood. It was the sort of thing I could play for a couple of hours on a  wet Sunday afternoon or in the evenings with a glass of wine in one hand and the mouse in the other. Other times, I found myself getting restless and wanted something a bit more... active to do. It takes a long time to get places and you have to plough through a lot of irrelevant dialogue. It's probably best played alongside something else.\n\nI'm really one the fence about the whole thumbs up / thumbs down thing. Like I say, I not only liked it, but respected the... craft that had gone into it. It definitely deserved its \"critics awards.\" But the question Steam asks is \"Would you recommend this to another player?\" And it doesn't give you a \"Well, maybe, it depends...\" option. Ultimately, DE is definitely different and, very possibly, a classic... It's just a classic of a genre I'm not sure *that* many people are into nowadays - it might have been mainstream twenty years ago but it feels rather more niche now. \n\nTLDR - It's good, it's just not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Indeed, I'm not sure it's going to be most people's cup of tea. Watch some gameplay videos before you take the plunge and be sure you're up for doing a *lot* of reading / listening.

Choose your pick.\nThis is a game that embodied all of my thoughts about RPGs, and at the same time, defined my new understanding of this genre.\nDisco Elysium is an RPG. RPG \u2014\u00a0is Disco Elysium.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Well, when the game only came out, people described it as \"an RPG without tactical combat\". For me, this was baffling. Tactical combat is one type of game system, and role-playing is a completely different type. But for many, these things go hand in hand, as such was a role-playing history. It first was developed on the basis of tabletop wargames, and combat and tactics still linger in the public conscience as a part of the genre's definition. Like some sort of rudiment organ, left from the ancient prehistoric progenitor.\nBut the thing is, the role-playing game has evolved. Like a species, absorbing a genetic material of many different ancestors, all whirling and mixing in a stream that composes a deep genetic pool... Okay, this metaphor is getting out of hand now.\nBut there are many RPGs now if we're talking tabletop. Drama games, narrative games, conceptual games, systems games, psyche games, some strange abstract Nordic games... A person can play RPGs for their entire life, having diverse experiences, and never once engage in turn-based combat.\n\nBut what does compose role-play game system? To be honest, that's a harder question. Especially when we're talking digital games. Is this the part that happens in your psyche? Is this the choices that you make, or relationships you create? Is it about the words you use, the image you create? \nI would say yes, and yes, and yes. But it's hard to quantify, to analyse. It's hard to put an artistic image someone creates in their head into a design document. To analyse this you had to always pick up things that were heavily mixed, in the Cinderella-esque task of sorting beans from lentils. There is always an RPG with turn-based combat or with action combat or some other exploration.\nBut Disco Elysium, it seems to provide the experience that is the closest to pure role-playing. And this is what I come to RPGs for. I want more of it.\nStill, what does that mean? First, you have a role \u2014 a person you embody in this fictional world, and of whom you control parts of their identity \u2014 physical appearance, psychological state, social standing.\nIn this fictional world, there is a fiction going on, a narrative, that is influenced by you but not entirely controlled. You can choose to say something, but you don't control the reaction of other characters. You may try to accomplish something, but sometimes your efforts are not enough. That's where the skill system comes in \u2014 it emulates the irregularity, the unpredictability of the world, and also gives meaning to your ability to pick one aspect of the identity over the others. Your decisions have consequences, and sometimes they are in nobody's control.\n\nIn strict mechanical terms, the game supports its core gameplay. Thought cabinet lets you equip thoughts, abstract concepts and observations that emerge in the character's during interactions with the world, to gain mechanical benefit \u2014 and some lore/character exploration bits.\nUnique skill system influences who Harry is not only on a mechanical but on a personal level. It determines, who he is, not only what he can do. This is an ingenious concept. Skills determine your thoughts and influence your experiences and your opinions. Like different facets of one identity, some are more prominent than others.\n\nIn narrative terms, this is a story with one of the main themes of discovering or determining who you are. Who you are, what you believe, are the questions that will pop up in many conversations throughout the game, prompting you to express yourself, to think about the role you're choosing to play. \n\nThat's one of the things that I like in Disco Elysium. That it's about the role, the identity \u2014 the way that you act and interact with it. One could say that it puts the \"role\" back into \"roleplaying game\", but I won't. It's too cheesy.\nBut, as I said, it's hard to find words to describe this game.\n\nYeah, duh \u2014 my imaginary critic might say. But why is it fun? \n\nWell, expressing yourself and exploring an identity is fun in itself. Who are you? What does it mean? What consequences will being such a person have? What will you have to do and sacrifice to be the person you're trying to be?\n\nThen, there's the detecting. Detective work, exploring, finding clues, making conclusions. These things are separate from the identity stuff, but it's super satisfying. The game constantly throws questions at you, gives you leads, and promises an exciting answer. You are drawn to it, like wealth to extreme net-worth individuals, and it's near impossible to refuse the call. The pacing of opening and closing tasks, containers, leads, and questions is so, so good. This is a game, where detective work becomes that \"one more turn\" pull of strategy games.\n\nAlso, everything else. The soundtrack \u2014 absolutely gorgeous. It's one of the ingredients that make you fall in love with the run-down hole that is Martiniese at first sight. Or hearing.\nArt \u2014 from expressive and experimental character portraits to the last floorboard of the background \u2014 holds your attention with its details and mood. \nThe sensory experience is so pleasing, so mesmerising, that it's hard to avert your gaze. This makes the game stand out from many that came before and are coming after it. Disco Elysium asks a lot of you \u2014\u00a0a lot of reading, mastering unfamiliar systems, thinking sometimes uncomfortable thoughts \u2014 but it makes the experience as smooth as possible. And extraordinarily rewarding.\n\nAnd writing. The star of the show. Character voices? Check. Absolute interactivity? Check. From past events to your skills, to your thoughts, to your \"party\", to your equipment \u2014\u00a0all of it can modify the flow of the narrative, making it seem like an absolutely emergent and natural experience. World-building \u2014 double check. Insane mastery of foreshadowing? Love did him in, and communism killed him.\nThis is like a cake that reveals more and more layers the deeper you cut.\n\nIt's hard to find words to describe this game.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. Inventory management becomes tedium in the second half. I've encountered quite a few bugs, with equipment just vanishing from my inventory, and characters remembering the events not as they unfolded. Nothing critical, but I always had spare saves ready, just in case. \nThought cabinet might become unwieldy, you may be left with more skill points than you'll have the use for, lead creators of the game may become conned out of the IP rights that can leave a sequel hanging, and the lead writer that wrote a protagonist to be extremely competent but terrible to work under, might have been extremely competent but terrible to work under.\n\nOh yeah. Disco. Disco is the word.\n\nBut this \u2014 this game is an extraordinary work of art. It influences and will influence innumerable games that will come after it.

With its unparalleled depth, thought-provoking themes, and exceptional writing, this game demands the attention of every player seeking a unique and immersive experience. Disco Elysium is undoubtedly a title that deserves widespread acclaim and a solid 4.5-star rating.\n\nOne of the standout features of Disco Elysium is its exceptional narrative. The game presents a richly layered and thought-provoking story set in the city of Revachol, a decaying world filled with political intrigue and societal struggles. The writing is truly remarkable, offering a level of complexity and nuance rarely seen in video games. The dialogue is sharp, intelligent, and filled with biting social commentary, allowing players to explore a wide range of topics and perspectives.\n\nThe game's protagonist, a troubled detective with a shattered memory, further adds to the narrative brilliance of Disco Elysium. Players are tasked with shaping the character's personality, moral compass, and approach to investigations, resulting in a truly unique and personalized experience. The depth of the protagonist's inner thoughts, emotions, and internal conflicts is masterfully crafted, creating a profound and engaging character study.\n\nVisually, Disco Elysium embraces a distinct art style that complements its gritty noir setting. The hand-painted backgrounds, stylish character designs, and atmospheric lighting contribute to the game's immersive and atmospheric world. The attention to detail in the environmental design adds depth to the city of Revachol, making it feel alive and deeply rooted in its own history and lore.\n\nGameplay in Disco Elysium is predominantly focused on dialogue interactions and decision-making. The game encourages exploration, investigation, and thoughtful decision-making, with each choice carrying significant weight and consequences. The character development system, based on skill checks and dialogues, allows players to tailor their detective's abilities to suit their preferred playstyle, adding depth and replay value.\n\nDespite its many strengths, Disco Elysium may not appeal to everyone due to its heavily dialogue-driven nature. Some players seeking more action-oriented gameplay or fast-paced narratives may find the game's slow pacing and extensive dialogue sequences less engaging. However, for those willing to immerse themselves in the world of Disco Elysium, the rewards are immeasurable.\n\nIn conclusion, Disco Elysium is an absolute masterpiece that demands the attention of every player seeking a deeply immersive and thought-provoking experience. Its exceptional narrative, complex characters, and remarkable writing make it a standout title in the gaming industry. While its dialogue-heavy nature may not resonate with all players, the game's unparalleled depth and narrative excellence warrant a solid 4.5-star rating. Disco Elysium is a must-play for anyone who appreciates storytelling at its finest and is eager to explore the boundaries of what video games can achieve as an artistic medium.", "timestamp_created": 1689633921, "timestamp_updated": 1689633921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142184853": {"recommendationid": "142184853", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067668536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 240, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1695656085}, "language": "english", "review": "soft locked myself out of my first run because my character didn't have the willpower to refuse to sit in a chair that was so uncomfortable it killed him. 10/10 game", "timestamp_created": 1689495178, "timestamp_updated": 1689495178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142125249": {"recommendationid": "142125249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084522086", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1691118074}, "language": "english", "review": "As an adult that started to think I was getting bored of games, this game helped me realize that modern games just suck. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1689422080, "timestamp_updated": 1689422080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142081471": {"recommendationid": "142081471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169140841", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1693504644}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally I can experience my life as a sad alcoholic man who spits out inappropriate quips at other people... shit.", "timestamp_created": 1689363405, "timestamp_updated": 1689363405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142070462": {"recommendationid": "142070462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314195321", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 230, "playtime_at_review": 5526, "last_played": 1695630691}, "language": "english", "review": "Disco Elysium is an absolute masterpiece, every hour I have spent in this game was an amazing experience, simply put it is one of the most in depth and incredible RPGs I have ever played and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nEverything about this game and its world is truly mesmerising, it features an amazing story with some of the best writing I have ever experienced, so many moments in this game have me laughing my head off, or on the verge of tears.

Although all the dialogue in the game is voiced, and by a quirky selection of voice actors, there is a ton of reading to get through in this game. Disco is an odd combination of an RPG and a Point and Click adventure, set in a unique, and surprisingly deep setting. Although not immediately clear, the setting is an alternate universe with different, but familiar technology and history. The title of the game is most likely a reference to the Latin, Disco - to learn or acquire knowledge, and Elysium - which can be a state or a place of bliss. The player in the game awakes with no memory, and a ton of problems, so the whole game is a search for knowledge and either resolving or ignoring your problems.\n\nPresenting with a very cool art style, the game is essentially a point and click adventure game, with the player investigating a murder that has taken place during a labour action at a port in the city of Revachol. \nThe unique, (but probably not for long), addition to this is some very strong RPG elements. While you cannot choose the gender or appearance of your Detective, you do decide what kinda of detective he is. Is he Sherlock Holmes type creature of pure logic and deduction? A tough guy that gets what he wants by roughing suspects up? A smooth social animal that could trick a confession from a rock? All your characters skills form a sort of brain that provides your inner monologue, noticing or not noticing things in the world around you. Opposing skills will often come into conflict, \"Rhetoric\" may advise you to confess your situation to a person,  while \"Half-Light\" will say - \"Don't tell anyone anything!\". \n\nJust because your skills suggest something, doesn't mean it's the correct choice, your skills just determine the options available to you in conversations. The police procedural parts of the game are fun, especially if your character has high \"Logic\" and \"Visual Calculus\". There are a few skills checks in the game that must be passed for the game to advance, so while failing skill checks is often irrelevant, and pretty common, some must be passed, which caused me to get stuck at one point, until I googled my way forward. Once failed, most checks can be reattempted once you increase that skill a point, so generally, if you go do something else for a bit, get some xp, you can take another crack, or just resort to saving and reloading until you can get past. \n\nThe story is interesting, and has a lot of odd characters for you to meet and interrogate. The pacing is a little strange, so don't feel bad if you feel lost and confused. Two or three game days in, I had barely even scratched the murder investigation, and was feeling pretty lost, but once I found that there was a \"must pass\" skill check I was ignoring, (because it had like a 12% chance of success), the murder case blew open, and was quickly wrapped up.\n\nBugs: I encountered two major issues in my playthrough, firstly the icons for using held items, (like eating and drinking), no longer map to the clickable area for the buttons, needing you to click below and left of the button to drink. The second issue was a timed NPC, who I was supposed to meet between 22:00 and 02:00 failed to spawn, and I wasted a bit of time looking for them until finding that saving and reloading the game made them pop into existence. Both issues were overcome with some google searches, but it seems issues like this aren't getting patched out at this point.", "timestamp_created": 1688991733, "timestamp_updated": 1688992806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141651840": {"recommendationid": "141651840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156786354", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2757, "last_played": 1688875481}, "language": "english", "review": "HAAARDCOOOREEE YEEAAAAAAGHHHHH", "timestamp_created": 1688876029, "timestamp_updated": 1688876029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141642885": {"recommendationid": "141642885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010337618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2994, "last_played": 1688864762}, "language": "english", "review": "It's, like, 95% dialogue about communism and art.

You can follow in the footsteps of Harrier Du Bois or make your own, all of which can lead to more than a couple humorous, tense or just fascinating encounters and events. The skill system is very unique, and adds a great sense of style and flair to the game's overall presentation, I just don't think their are enough single or overlapping skill checks in this game, and when there is they lead to little. The game's atmosphere, style, writing and music is bar none some of the best I have seen in a video game, and I would say that is where this game really shines. It's not the most fun or interactive game I ever have played, but its ability to meld the mediums of traditional art, music, and writing seamlessly into the video game format must be commended.

With it, I played a series of games by MAXIM: Sims Bustin' Out and Sims The Urbz. They were isometric world exploration games with quests and character progression. As simple and retrospectively juvenile these products were - they held a solid core that I felt a unique connection with. Disco Elysium is a masterwork that takes this novel and niche idea and detonates it into a fantastic display; it tickles a very specific nerve of mine - and I'm sure there are more out there that will find this to be a refined, deliberate experience for some.\n\nYou play as a nameless amnesiac and have to piece your life - you are accompanied by many different personalities and idioms that dwell inside of your head. With all of your sensibilities and different inner voices, you are tasked with re-learning the world around you, piecing together why events have happened, and solving numerous mysteries as the story unfolds. The majority of the game is conveyed through dialogue trees with some very light exploration through an isometric medium. The unique interaction between your character and his inner voices is infinitely fascinating, and becomes the core of this experience that will carry you through. Playing the game is a practice of allotting points to increase these aspects of yourself to further improve (And change) the nature of your interactions as you act as a gumshoe, applying yourself to mysteries ranging from simple to metaphysical in nature.\n\nThe game, while endlessly creative, harbors a very dry pallet. No flashy set pieces, no adrenaline fueled episodes, it is a comprehensively arid product. I'm the guy who opens up the codex in Mass Effect and Dragon Age titles and reads through the glossary for fun. I'm the kind of person that makes spread sheets in my free time. I like to read. If you're not keen on reading vast quantities of text and trying to learn everything about a new fictional setting - this game is probably going to lose you quickly. It requires a lot of focus and drive to digest, so if you're less interested in reading and better drawn to this year's Call Of Duty shooty-shooty dross, this is a pass for you.\n\nThis game is, ostensibly, a text based adventure with a very pretty 3D UI. The isometric world is not so much a definitive aspect of the game itself - but a medium to allow players to freely move from one text prompt to the next. This is less of a 3D game from yesteryear as much as a modern, detective version of ZORK or something abouts.\n\nThe interfacing is a massive highlight. The art, the sound, it is sublime. This is an aspect of the game where there are no true faults. 10/10 in this area. Hearing the moving music from the simple beats to the dramatic swells is flavorful - and the voice acting is second to none. I honestly think that this game rivals Darkest Dungeon for the best narrator, and I'm looking forward to getting an OST now that I've finished it. An Artbook would be an excellent addition to my coffee table - because every portrait and every aspect of the world is a feast for the eyes.\n\nThis game, in many respects, reminds me of a AA version of some overly-ambitious flash title back in the early 2010's. The mechanics are simple, the methods are rudimentary, and the bulk of the content is through 'cheap' text. There were titles similar to this back on ArmorGames or MiniClip (Last Stand Union City, Sonny, etc.) And it gives off this vibe in spades. It doesn't feel like corpo shovel ware designed to placate and milk the customer by lulling them into an over-stimulated dopamine stupor... it feels like a well crafted passion project that requires the smallest bit of effort to interface with.\n\nThe game has a lot of benefits that will be enjoyed when you boot it up:\n-The world weeps with richness, every interaction is compelling and aspects of the world unfold before you as a miasma of charismatic ploys.\n-Choices determine the type of character that you grow to play - you can be a drug addict communist, a sober professional, a violent egotist, or anything in between.\n-You WILL get what you paid for - tickets for movies will run you double digits for an hour or two... Disco Elysium was engaging to me for 30+ hours!\n-Characters are masterfully written and feel like they belong.\n-You can play through more than once to create new approaches and different kinds of characters - the random mechanics of the game encourage trying again with differing methods.\n-It is hilarious - I laughed to the point of tears more than once.\n-The voice acting is premium and unforgettable - the writing and the acting breathe LIFE into the game... it is far from a wooden experience.\n-A PAGE TURNER - I hardly got out of my chair and have been contantly trying to steal time away from my real-life responsibilities to keep playing - it's like a book that you want to read and re-read.\n\nIt has its fair share of drawbacks, though. Such as:\n-Percentage based randomness means that you can fail at something you spent hours preparing for, while also encouraging you to save-scum and spam attempts to save yourself the hassle.\n-If you want to get the most out of your playthrough, you will save-scum to pass checks, and that's boring as all hell.\n-You will be woefully undeveloped at the beginning of the game and constantly struggling to pass checks, and you never really get to a place where you are happy... the game is a journey towards getting better, but it feels like it ends before you truly get comfortable with who you are.\n-Replays are dulled because mysteries can only be solved once - and a lot of the flair and comedy lose their luster the second time around.\n-The ending is abrupt and there is no falling action; a lot of loose ends and character dynamics sit unresolved.\n-Characters will get built up and become incredibly interesting - but once they become outside the scope of the core game, they become useless.\n-Interrogations and detective work start out strong and grow sadly less as difficult with time, and it is not due to skillchecks or points.\n-Numerous bugs and glitches.\n-Your inventory is going to be 99% useless clothes that you don't want and cannot get rid of. There's also no penalty to swapping, so clothing turns from a fun customization option into a boring exploit that weighs down your pocket space\n-Impossible Skill checks can ruin your game if you don't save-scum them.\n-No New Game + or any post-game rewards. If you want to experience all that this game has to offer, prepare to pull your own teeth out and grind your bones for broth. Instead of being encouraged to make different approaches and explore, you're going to have to do things the hard way for repeat visits to the title.\n\nI understand that there's a lot of controversy going on surrounding the ownership of this game, and if the property holders are scumbags or truly \"worthy\" of your money. But at the end of the day, you have to choose if you play the game or don't. If the game's worth buying, it's worth buying - don't get wrapped up in legal battles or moral high ground.\n\nAlso - I will never forget this game for the stick bugs alone.\n\n~\n\nTL;DR\n9.5/10\nDisco Elysium is an Exceptional game.\nIt builds upon a solid base with an ever widening scope that produces a potent experience - delivered directly to the pallet of particular enthusiasts that share the same affections.\nWhile the methods are simple and older than anticipated, the true splendor of the experience lies in wait between the ocean waves and the crime scenes - something truly beautiful, shining in the reeds.", "timestamp_created": 1688142170, "timestamp_updated": 1688142170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140905151": {"recommendationid": "140905151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104785078", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3679, "last_played": 1690423421}, "language": "english", "review": "Mr.Evrart is helping me find my lost gun.", "timestamp_created": 1688046106, "timestamp_updated": 1688046106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140659800": {"recommendationid": "140659800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880340319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3320, "last_played": 1689302338}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, no jokes just pure love for this game and it's writing.

overwhelming detail of its story and world and characters, found out so much about it all, laughed, cried, and felt fully satisfied with its gameplay loop and narrative arc and yet STILL i feel as though i'm just scratching the surface of it. i won't get into too much of the specifics of what happens in this game, those who have played it already get it and those who haven't shouldn't have it spelled out for them, but suffice to say this scratches just about every itch i've ever had. i've mentioned southland tales before on this site, and this definitely has those vibes in SPADES, but other films it reminded me of are things like the long goodbye, inherent vice, the doom generation, twin peaks: the return (and mullholland dr. fr that matter), miami vice (2006), and strange days, all these wide sweeping neo-noirs who's simple mystery concepts bely a much more wide reaching thematic breadth about the nature of humanity, society, and our very own existence. it's a gorgeous and devastating piece of fiction, who's utter nihilism is cut by it's brief moments of stunning humanity and kindness.\nbut that's the thing, that is how it feels in this permutation of the game. while the developers obviously guide their players into specific play styles and modes of interacting with its characters, and there's no way that the game can really be COMPLETELY different on each subsequent playthrough. the way that the game is written, and the way that it is structured fully around your own choices in what to say with no combat mechanics of any sort, allows you to feel like every encounter could go any number of different ways. at the same time, because it is all structured around your own choices, it makes each dialogue decision feel monumental, it keeps the player so invested with what each word means, fully engaging you in harry's psyche while also never just making him feel like a player insert. much like every character in the game, harry feels fully formed in many ways. your decisions help shape him yes, but his dialogue is written so well that the choices do not just feel like you are putting yourself into him but that you two are inhabiting the same mortality, working together to help solve these cases. you are just another voice in his brain, hoping to make the most of dire situations.\nanyway, i've gone on for long enough, the ending i got made

barely ever got through the first day but i decided to actually give it a play recently an found that it was an absolute master piece of a game that is both emotionally involving and genuine in a lot of ways, the way it tells its story and how the parts of the main protagonists mind have differing personalities that you can choose to listen to or ignore really drives the main characters characterization and lets you become engrossed in his past and how you choose to make him who you want to be, and it is in that sense that i think the game really hits home with a protagonist that both has backstory but also is up to the player to create who they are and who they will become. I give this game a definite 10 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good rpg to play.

The skills are basically voices in your head that give you insights and even argue with each other, which I thought was creative and entertaining.\nI was worried I'd lose interest in this game eventually, but this game hooked me within the first 10 minutes and never let go until the end.\n\nThere are only a few downsides or problems I can think of and they're nothing major either:\n1. In the latter half of the game, it's clear that while the dialogue was written to adapt based on your choices, it wasn't always voiced. Basically, if you make some obscure choices, the text will say X, but the voice actor will say Y.\n2. The game introduces some supernatural elements towards the end. I personally thought this didn't really fit the otherwise realistic and gritty world too well and just felt unnecessary.\n3. The game gets pretty political. This isn't an issue by itself, but the fact that the game gives you the choice between 4 political affiliations and then mocks you for picking one that isn't communism is a bit weird.\n4. You need to level uip your stats to retry checks. This means you can softlock yourself out of side quests if you have reached the maximum threshold in a skill or are near a point of no return with no way to get EXP and level up. This could've easily been fixed if either starting a new day or increasing your stats via gear or some other means allowed you to retry skill checks.\n5. The game leaves you without your sidekick for a day at some point because he has to take care of something. This just feels unnecessary and weird, because the sidekick will talk about things that happened in his absence as if he had been there. It also means you will miss out on your sidekicks commentary and help for anything you do within that day. Since I felt pressured to use my time wisely and make progress quickly, this means I missed out on a lot of dialogue. His absence adds nothing and shouldn't have happened. \n\nLike I mentioned, these five points don't really detract from the experience much at all though, so you should definitely give this game a try whether you like these types of games or want to try something new.", "timestamp_created": 1682109796, "timestamp_updated": 1682109796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137066190": {"recommendationid": "137066190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419026270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1694807448}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it", "timestamp_created": 1682099883, "timestamp_updated": 1682099883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136833624": {"recommendationid": "136833624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004579604", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4660, "last_played": 1617497181}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game, hate the company that stole it out from under its creator.

There has been some pretty nasty controversy with the game\u2019s parent company, and long story short, a lot of the people who spearheaded this game won\u2019t be seeing any of the money you pay for it. Do with this information what you will and I apologise for the cringe-worthy excuse of a review I've posted below. \n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b]\nGiven you enjoy reading and/or audiobooks, this game is a masterpiece you can\u2019t afford to miss. Disco elysium puts you into the skin of a living but amnesia riddled failure who might have once been a police officer. Through brilliant comedy, a compelling, zany world and inhabitants, and a clever approach to political commentary, Disco Elysium weaves a soulful story about finding beauty and friendship in even the toughest of worlds. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\n\n[b]Rhetoric [Challenging: Failure][/b] - Hey, why don\u2019t you write this review in the game\u2019s writing style, it\u2019ll be *Creative* and *High-concept*. You ARE an art-cop, aren\u2019t you? \n\n[b]You[/b] - Why don\u2019t I just write a normal review, this takes too much effort, it\u2019s really not that creative and I won\u2019t emulate the style that well, anyway. \n\n[b]Drama [Medium: Success][/b] - You ran around in Harry\u2019s ugly tie for a week, sire, you practically *are* him. If you\u2019re worried about not being able to think like him, you should get off that pyrholidon. \n\n[b]Authority [Easy: Success][/b] - Screw what other people think. MAKE them like it. MAKE them read it. You\u2019re the one in control here.\n\n[b]You[/b] - All right, I guess so. \n\nDisco Elysium has been on my radar for the longest while, and it was my short encounter with betrayal at club low\u2019s similar gameplay system back in January that finally tipped the scales and made me boot it up. Although initially put off by the sheer amount of text, dialogue and overwhelming skill system, when I finally sat down to play for more than a few minutes, the game rapidly took over my life. \n\n[b]Encyclopaedia [Easy: Success][/b] - At its core, Disco Elysium is a text-centric RPG with some unique and somewhat abstract watercolour visuals, and two six sided dice which are rolled together with some modifiers, whenever you need to make a skill check. These modifiers come from a skill system made up of 24 skills, each of which is given a unique personality and even dialogue. The game takes place within a crappy district of the city Revachol, where you are tasked with solving a murder. The issue: You are an alcoholic, drug addled failure of a police officer. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to really describe how a game which is essentially two dice and a lot of text is able to make the player feel such a wide range of emotions. Although I\u2019d argue that above all else, the game is a pitch-black comedy, the range of themes this game tackles, the feelings it elicits are so broad that it\u2019s nigh on impossible to tie it down within a single genre. Even with the breadth of subject matters tackled, the game manages to exhibit a staggering depth. All of the characters, hell even the ones that seem to just exist for comic relief at first glance, are fleshed out to the point that I found myself getting attached to some unlikely candidates. If a game manages to make me feel sympathetic towards a 12 year old scouser brat who refers to himself in the third person and seems to employ slurs as a form of punctuation, you know the writing has got to be compelling. \n\n[b]Esprit de corps [Easy: Success][/b] - Kim! You\u2019ve *got* to mention Kim. \n\n[b]You[/b] - Yes, getting to it now. \n\nAlthough most of the game\u2019s characters are brilliantly unique, none of them hold a candle to Kim Kitsuragi, your partner, A.K.A. the poor lieutenant who is forced to put up with all of your shit throughout your investigation. For reasons of spoilers, I can\u2019t delve too much into the brilliance with which the game develops your relationship with Kim, but I\u2019ve never felt so attached to a partner since the mystery dungeon games. Harry DuBois, the mess of a person who\u2019s singular shoe you find yourself in at the beginning, is an all too easy character for anyone like me (who\u2019s made some very subpar life choices) to connect with. Kim\u2019s constant support and trust in the face of constant disappointment is so compelling that some of his positivity rubbed off on my real-life self. \n\n[b]Shivers [Heroic: Success][/b] - The world of Elysium spoke to you, tell them what you saw. \n\nYou - Okay, okay. Disco Elysium\u2019s world is unsurprisingly, just as zany and fleshed out as its inhabitants. Video game worldbuilding is hit or miss for me. It\u2019s hard to find a game nowadays without some kind of lore to delve into, but most of the time I find myself ignoring it in the face of more immediate interests. I\u2019m all too glad to say that this isn\u2019t the case here. Disco Elysium\u2019s approach to lore dumping is as creative as it is compelling: The game exploits Harry\u2019s amnesiac nature to have him learn about the rules of the world at the same rate you do. Being able to grow your understanding of the world along with the main character is a compelling tactic that gives lore-reading a deeply personal aspect. Perhaps my only serious critique of the game also stems from its worldbuilding, however - the game sometimes throws so many new words and names at you that it can feel impossible to keep track of everything, which led to a small amount of the dialogue being completely lost on me. \n\nElysium is a strange world in that although it contains a lot of wholly alien concepts, it\u2019s also got a lot of very *real* things too - none more blindingly obvious than the game\u2019s coverage of very real political beliefs. I would go so far as to say that Disco Elysium is the most political game ever made that doesn\u2019t take a blindingly obvious stance on politics (although, don\u2019t get me wrong, it definitely takes a stance). Want to become a raging fascist - erm - [i]Traditionalist[/i], who believes that nothing is above the free market? Well go right ahead - just remember you\u2019ve gotta bear the consequences that brings. Disco Elysium employs its bizarre and pitch black sense of humour to cover some of these topics, giving the player a degree of removal without which many players would certainly put down the game due to it being \u201ctoo political\u201d. The game does this as tastefully as possible, with some topics (e.g. [spoiler]rape[/spoiler]) being treated as seriously as they should. The game has this ability to switch between goofy mode and serious mode on a dime without feeling jarring, which I respect the hell out of. Disco Elysium doesn\u2019t just use humour to cover political issues either: The bizarre situations you will often find yourself in are used as a tool to bring you closer to the game\u2019s characters. Who can say they didn\u2019t feel a little closer to Kim after absolutely demolishing a random pinball game you stumbled upon in a disused corridor. \n\nThrough its use of Zany yet compelling characters, an alien yet familiar world, and tastefully black humour, Disco Elysium is able to paint a beautiful, somewhat abstract watercolour portrait of failure, love and camaraderie. Through its back-handed approach to political commentary, Disco Elysium encourages even the most certain to think on their opinions and beliefs, and above all else to have some empathy for all of those evil apes dukin\u2019 it out on the ball we call home. \n\n[h1]6/6[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/GentleHoovy/recommended/][b]More of my reviews here![/b][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1680818416, "timestamp_updated": 1680818839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136124392": {"recommendationid": "136124392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040332332", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2754, "last_played": 1681272560}, "language": "english", "review": "The most beautiful and well written game I've ever played, the world and setting are so complex, the characters are extremely diverse, fun and unique, and the overall story and messages left such a lasting impact on me, it's clear the writer put an immense amount of love into this world.

Buy it on torrents, or buy it full price, once the devs take back control over this game.\n\nAs for the actual game...\n\nGameplay.\t\n\tWell, the game is very strange indeed. First of all, after completing it for fist time on my second attempt, i can't see why everybody (including mainstream press) praise this game for hard. Gameplay wise, I would say it is kind of disaster. You have a game with lots and lots of long dialogues spiced up by occasional skill check. Seem alright at first, right? Wrong! Everybody says that it is fine to lose skill check, that it is makes the game more \u201cinteresting\u201d. Only in reality, by failing important skill check you can be completely cockblocked from part of the story or side quest. Yes, you can retry \u201cwhite checks\u201d when you level up skill corresponded to the skill check, and yes you can use gear to boost your stats, but are ANYONE actually trued to play it? Or mainstream Journos spend like 2 hours in the game, come as far as day 2, and then write up their articles, praising the game? Because in realty, \u201cgameplay\u201d of this game feels like reading a book, while you need roll a dice before you allowed to read next chapter. And if you cant roll well, game will shrug and say - \u201cWell maybe you can go do something else, and them come back\u201d. Which is equivalent of you, putting down the book you have been reading, so you can go read something else instead, because dice decided so. Very cool experience. In game like that, there should be multiple routs to achieve same results for different character builds. But this is not the case here. So the actual \u201cgameplay\u201d of this game, for anyone who like read the story is \u2013 save the game before difficult skill check, buff up, equip all items for the skill needed, and then reload endlessly. This is bad and disgusting, but at least you get most of the story. And don\u2019t get me wrong, - the idea of certain type of builds doing their own thing, the thing that only they build can do -  is fine. Im totally fine with mine \u201cintellectual/empaty\u201d build, not being able succeed in heavy physical checks, right away. But mind you, those fails, usually lead to less \u201cstory\u201d shown to player, less dialogues open, which is very bad. There MUST be a ways for lets say, physically weak MC to get info about, lets say a gym teacher, without making legendary bench press, in order to impress the gym teacher. But, no. Usually all you can do, is level up, equip gear and go for the save-reload approach. To be fair, there IS some alternative path branching, but mostly for the main story only. Side staff is all about reloading game.\n\nStory.\n\tStory is very strange too. You might hear/read about how this game are being \u201cpolitical\u201d, or \u201cpro-communism\u201d, or critique capitalism? This all an giga-trolling, whole damn thing, lol. I heard somewhere that this game is \u201cpolitical compass test\u201d, what joke lol. Ok, lets me explain. Basically, what writers done, is collected all anti-communist/capitalist memes, and spread it evenly all over the game. If you try to read texts on communism in the game it is all literally about how to best grind the rich people into meat or how communism has never been build before, etc. And if you try to talk with local communists underground, all you will hear from them is how everyone except them is a fascist, lol. It all a one big shitpost. How can anyone, who took time to read dialogues, be offended by it (no matter of political alignment)? What is even more hilarious, is how people saying that this game anti-capitalist, while capitalist dialogues mostly \u201csane\u201d while communist dialogues reads like raving of raging lunatics. More to the point in-game definition of communism/capitalism is very different from real word. For example the Union, which treated by game as \u201ccommunistic\u201d is actually ideal depiction of \u201cno guys, corporation IS your friends, we will work alongside them in unison\u201d \u2013 typical fascistic dictatorship. No need to mention funny mustache man, you can just look/read up on modern day Amazon warehouses, or on Chinese electronic manufacturers plants \u2013 the ones with nets around roofs for the jumpers, because it is frequent occurrence there. Basically the political \u201csides\u201d in the game do not correspond to the ones with the same name in real life. And if you get offended by it \u2013 it mean, that you as a player, know jack shit about the real word politics. That is the joke, I suspect. I mean, alright yeah, there is SOME reasonable points presented, about every politic side -  communism/capitalism/traditionalism(named Moralism in this game), but there is much more just batshit insane dialogues. To illustrate this, -  in-game \u201cfascism\u201d is\u2026 I don\u2019t know what exactly\u2026 Wive-beatism? Bear-under-tv ism? Because it is basically what is it to it in the game\u2019s terms. Every fascism dialogue or perk is about how you hate womans (the Man of Wo!), and how they must sit in the kitchen and tend to children, I dunno, its very very strange take of fascism. Maybe that the joke too? What im trying to say, that if you will try to play this game as Serious Gamer, with Serious Political Views, using real-live political compass, you probably will end up in \u201claughable centrist\u201d. Because, I suspect, all in-game politic sides is \u201cfake\u201d and incoherent with the real word politics, so you supposed to just turn your braid off and ride it on \u2013 discussing how revolutionary turnips grow better under communistic leadership, because of revolutionary plasma which is produced by communistic people just by being communistic (also by lore of the game, the plasma allows extra communistic mans have sex, nonstop, up to 10 hours in one go). Or observing how difference in income, might produce light bending effects around extra rich persons.\n\n\tIn conclusion, bad game-play, weird story, but you not gonna regret playing it, probably.

The playable area, while small, is so fleshed out and full of character that it honestly felt much, much larger. The way that both the protagonist and his police partner Kim are characterized throughout the course of the game is both funny and charming, and still manages to give the player a surprising amount of agency and flexibility in choosing the kind of personality that their character and his story goes. The political angles of the gameplay and world are also handled well, albeit with every faction having their tongue-in-cheek jabs thrown at them, from communists being either aging war veterans or snobby hipsters to \"individualists\" being sterotypical wannabe hustler-types to literal self-proclaimed radical centrists who want to do nothing but maintain balance. I have to commend the devs for not being preachy and letting the player take whatever side they want while still poking fun at them no matter what. \n\nAs for the flaws...there are about two that really bug me a bit.\n\nA large portion of the choices provided are made via skill checks, and while this is usually the game's strength, there are two of these checks that I absolutely HATED.\n\nThe first was in the middle of the game and involved a certain vigilante group. You're supposed to be able to try it twice, and if you fail both times Kim will just pass it instead. However, depending on how you played, you may only be able to access the check once or twice. Why is this bad?  Because its a difficult check and you need to be able to try it multiple times to get past it, but it locks after each attempt until you do a task that relates to it and opens it up again with a slight bonus applied, meaning that you can get soft locked if you run out of options or don't attempt it enough, requiring the player to load their save and just keep trying. \n\nThe second of these is just blatantly bad. While the first was tough, but simple and fair when you understand what it wants, the final check near the very end of the game by the mural is AWFUL. You need to pass a check that is based on the Shivers skill, but its also a hard to pass check AND there's no other way around it. Not only that, but the tasks that you have to do to re-attempt it or get bonuses are only vaguely related, often times simply being in the same area as the sole connection. This is dumb, my character was a pure Logic and Rhetoric intellectual build, so why is he using instincts and intuition to determine the way into the endgame segment? Why no other options? Hell Kim literally enters the final building THROUGH A LOWER DOOR YOU COULDN'T SEE OR ACCESS. These aren't big issues at all, but they really were a drag and felt out of place in such an otherwise flawless game.\n\nOverall, I'd highly reccomend the game to anyone who wants a fun story-based RPG.

just the sheer fear of anybody dying, three huge people in full on plate armor pointing guns at you, that soundtrack, everybody being afraid, even titus, and in that one beautiful scene, all of your inner thoughts, after bickering together through the entire game, come together to try and save you in this one scene, to protect you. and after harry is shot, hearing titus yell \"protect the cop!\" and kim coming to your aid, and seeing that horrific red check mark where you have to warn kim before he gets shot \"the lieutenant REALLY trusts you.\" my god it was beautiful. kim, titus, and garte all showing genuine concern for harry. it was beautiful.\n\nand then, there's the ending. you finally discovered the killer and it turns out it's just some old man who's stuck in the past and cant let go of how life once was, and killed out of pure hate for the way others are enjoying, or at least trying to enjoy the existence they lead on the new revachol. and just when you think that's it, you reached the ultimate conclusion, the most unexpected thing ever happens.\n\nthe phasmid that the cryptozoologists were hunting and wanted to see so badly comes out of hiding, it was there the whole time, camouflaged in the reeds. the most beautiful part of that scene for me, was the fact that, even with how grounded in reality this game was, it always flirted with the paranormal, like if harry was actually a psychic and could talk to the dead, or the \"spirit\" in the bookstore that turned out to be a regular woman, or \"teleporting\" up the ladder only to find out that harry just closed his eyes and climbed it really fast. point is, it always hit you with seemingly supernatural elements, then revealed that whatever transpired isn't real. and you were thinking that would be the case with this phasmid as well, and then... kim hits you with the magic words. \"I see it too.\" \n\nmy god. getting those words of confirmation from KIM, made me break down. harry wasn't crazy. and that conversation with the phasmid, you feel such a heavy weight lifted off of harry's shoulders. almost like he has purpose anew. the phasmid reminded him of the beauty of the world, that it's worth to continue to live to fight another day, the phasmid reminded harry that he has a place in the world, and that he's not alone. which is all harry wanted from the world at that point. and before the phasmid left, she gave harry the parting words he needed so badly: \n\nHarry: out of all the creatures I've met, you are the most beautiful.\nPhasmid: thank you. I also have one final thing to say to you: that woman - turn from the ruin. Turn and go *forward*.\nHarry: what woman?\nPhasmid: you cannot lie to me. behind you it smells of fires. so awfully far you were prepared to go in her presence. end it.\n\nand the phasmid takes off. harry can move on now, he can continue to fight the good fight and even has kim by his side, who doesn't understand him completely, but acknowledges him as a great detective and fully willing to look past his problems and support him and work with him. just as we have grown to appreciate harry, so has he.\n\ni love harry. whether he's Harrier Du Bois, or Rapha\u00ebl Ambrosius Costeau, or Tequila Sunset, or Dick Mullen, or Shitkid as jean calls him. he's probably the most human protagonist i've ever played. and as Limbic System said, \"*He* is the infernal engine.

Thin, purple-blue lips cover a razor-sharp beak of black bone with which they frequently tear each other to shreds in fights over clients. These creatures secrete an addicting fluid from their erect penises which prolongs life by slowing metabolism. Addicts of Mugwump fluid are known as Reptiles. A number of these flow over chairs with their flexible bones and black-pink flesh.

I hated the character I was playing from the get go, and a lot of the dialogue choices seemed to be pretty stupid. Then I decided to say \"F*^k it, let's role play as a hopeless alcoholic who hasn't a clue about how the world works\" and persisted with the story, and it got much better. The plot is pretty decent, even though I felt some dialogue and backtracking was over wrought. Like most murder mysteries though, I don't think it is worth a second playthrough as the main plot beats are already known and there is no gameplay here other than the story choices you make (especially for me as I didn't like the main character and his life choices, lol). Dialogues often come with dice rolls, which are fairly annoying, and it seems that the developers are railroading you to repeat playthroughs with different character attributes so that you can check out what the other possibilities could have led to. But like I said before, the way to play it is to just accept whatever randomness the game throws at you and go ahead with the story.

"review": "Haven't played any RPG since KOTOR2. Not really a fan of the genre. However, this game came recommended by a friend back when it came out and I kept it on my wishlist and bought it when it went low enough. Have to say it's been quite fun. I love that most of the RPG elements have seemed like more traditional point and click adventure style elements (which I enjoy) and so far, combat is entirely non-existent (my least favorite part of RPG games because they are very jarring to realism and pull me out of the game just like QTEs - just a personal preference). In any case, the dialogue and story is quite rich - far more involved than I can do justice to right now (which really hurts because in another life, I would have drowned myself in the rich lore instead of just skimming for the gist and clicking through the amazingly well done voice acting). Still, I like so far that the game appears to be tolerant of a less than in-depth playthrough and has not penalized me (beyond the high level sense of missing out on deeper clues and inability to munchkin my way through because I have no experience with modern-day RPGs). Many thanks to the devs for making it possible for a weekend warrior to still enjoy this quite well - the journal and map is a major gift for me in this regard! \nIf you like RPGs, this is a can't miss game (though likely everyone already knows this by now :p). If you don't like RPGs, I would encourage you to give it a shot - seems like a great way to discover the genre (though I would recommend KOTOR 1 and 2 if you also have a passing fancy for Star Wars :)). \nA final note - the dialogue is dense but worth the wade through. So much philosophy (mostly economic ideologies so far - I heard somewhere the devs thanked Karl Marx in an award acceptance speech lol) that is very well done and the surreal sense of something eerie lurking in your mind and some supernatural stuff that may or may not be complete BS (and just our drinking problem manifesting itself) is fun and tantalizing.

I would rather not be given the choice to play it a certain way in the first place if that's the case. \n\nWhen I tried to play it straight as a detective or tried to make amends for some questionable stuff the main character gets into, it felt a lot like playing with a DM who wanted to seem chill but is actually hellbent on railroading PCs and will punish you for doing the 'wrong' thing.\n\nLooking up the Wikipedia article on Disco Elysium, it looks like the creators fell into a years-long depression and that they were struggling with alcoholism when their initial attempt at writing a book based on Disco Elysium's setting failed. It wasn't until a couple years after that they attempted to make this game. I think that really contextualises the negativity of the game itself.\n\nThat's not to say characters should not undergo difficulties or experience hardship.

It's a fascinating character study that explores the human condition in the most profound way. And yes, you have a crime story to solve, but I would even say the crime story itself is just something in the background, and the real focus is on the shattered personality of its troubled protagonist and the discussions around political theory.\n\nThe narrative is unparalleled and brought to life by the game's stunning art style, which perfectly matches the somber tone of the story. The voice actors breathe life into each character, infusing them with personality and emotion. Some may find the dialogues verbose and pretentious, but listening to the conversations unfold is actually a joy. They add depth and authenticity to the game's world.\n\nThe game is also quite original, and this is reflected in its mechanics. The skill system, for example, brilliantly replicates the fragmented persona of the main character, and the Thoughts the character develops over time need to be internalized before they are incorporated into the character. Also, the game is designed to limit minmaxing, so it cannot be played like a typical RPG.\n\nIt is hard to find a flaw in such a refined game; the only one that comes to mind is the lack of a proper tutorial. This can lead to an early, sudden death of the protagonist, which may discourage new players. It's a minor blemish on an otherwise perfect masterpiece, but it's worth noting for those who are going to play it for the first time. Taking this into account, I would also suggest new players to approach Disco Elysium differently from your typical RPG. Instead of feeling compelled to explore all dialogue options, take your time and choose your options carefully. Remember that you are embodying someone with a fragile, troubled, recovering personality.\n\nIn conclusion, the game's impressive narrative, art style, voice acting, and sheer originality all contribute to an immersive, introspective, unforgettable experience that is still unparalleled to date. It is a must-play for those seeking a unique and introspective journey into the human psyche.

A great democracy of creatures...\"\n\nOne of the most beautiful explorations of loss and human growth ever put to a piece of art, Disco Elysium stands on it's own as a truly meaningful work of art in a sea of copy and paste mediocrity, effortlessly moving from 360 spin-kicking a two metre tall racist into a truly insightful view of the main character's grief and turmoil. Harry Du Bois is Communism, an ideology most have given up on years ago, one that has been tried and tried again to failure, his strongest supporters lost and hateful of him and yet somehow a belief holds in some that he can return to greatness past his self indulgent episodes, more than Tequila Sunset. Something to build.\n\nIdeology in this game serves not as a belief on how countries should be run but instead as an insight on how the characters view not only the world around them but themselves. Evrart Claire is introduced as perhaps the defining Socialist of the game, leading the working class union against the bourgeois corporation they campaign against. However, the man we meet is a bloated, corrupt narcissist who is willing to crush the only working class village in Martinaise so as to develop his own (particularly un-socialist) view of what Martinaise should be, routinely attempting to bribe and manipulate the police so as to further his own goals; his only real source of fondness for Socialism is the power it gives him to rule as a tyrant. Joyce Messier on the other hand is introduced as an opposing force to Evrart, representing the capitalist corporation that seeks to destroy the striking union. However upon further dialogue with her we realise her as one of the only meaningfully class conscious characters in the game, providing consistent critiques on capital and the system she was sent to uphold. She exists as one of the few characters who appear to show any meaningful empathy for Harry and his pitiful condition. Despite this she still maintains her mission to stop the strike and uphold the very system she is critiquing, routinely using Harry for labour and enjoying the products of her wealth. She knows the system is a failure, she even mentions a past life as a disco-loving communist, she simply benefits too much to care. Through this lens we gain a deeper understanding of the characters we meet, Communism is not an ideology for any of these characters but merely a tool for their own self interests, a sentiment echoed in one of the final conversations of the game with a man who has truly lost faith not only in Communism, but the world that it could inhabit.\n\nAt the heart of the game lies the tragedy of our main character, Harry Du Bois. He isn't defined by his ideology like most other characters but by his grief. The game begins with him being awoken with an ambiguously caused amnesia, implied to be at least somewhat resultant of the excessive drinking and drug use caused by the loss of his wife six years ago. Since then he has lived his life by creating a wall of intense narcissism (or superstardom as he likes to call it) and substance abuse, only being kept around by his co-workers due to his incredible skills as a detective (largely aided by the aforementioned substance abuse). He cannot escape from his coping methods, we see his humour and superstardom being utilised in a run in with his ex-wife in some deranged attempt to win her back. He cannot escape from her either, on the first in-game day chances are that Harry will find and read a note written by her that he's kept all these years despite the pain it clearly causes him, reading it results in Harry completely passing out and requiring to be aided by his partner Kim. It hurts him but he cannot bring himself to let it go. Every trait we hear of Harry before his amnesia is a result of his loss, he's allowed himself to become it. In one interaction in the game we hear of Harry right before his total wipe, he tells others that his name is Tequila Sunset, he slips into a new identity, the logical end of his coping mechanisms; a man so consumed by his need to escape his grief that he becomes the embodiment of it. And yet hope remains, when he becomes Tequila Sunset it isn't sustainable and wakes up anew. Through this Harry is given the opportunity to rebuild himself as decided by the player's actions, it's only through his grief is he granted this mercy to define his new identity.\n\nThe game shows a man rising from the ashes, with a clean slate Harry is given the ability to reinvent himself. He\u2019s still guided by his thoughts, each of his 24 attributes being represented by separate characters, delivering some of the wittiest and most insightful quotes of the game as well as serving as the relevant stats for the multitude of classic RPG-like stat checks throughout the game. Harry is given the opportunity to better himself via the input of the player, however he can just as easily slip back into his old vices that put him where he is now thanks to his Electrochemistry skill constantly pushing on him to pick up a cigarette and a beer. The plot of Disco Elysium may be trying to solve the mystery of a hanged man, but it\u2019s a story of rebirth. Harry may never give up on the eccentricities central to his character but he can leave behind what was killing him, allowing him to reconnect with those he pushed away and connect with his new partner, Kim Kitsuragi. He may never love the same way he did with his wife but his happiness can still remain. This is perhaps most powerfully told in the quote, \u201cIn the dark times, should the stars also go out?\u201d. \n\nDisco Elysium is a fiercely intelligent, effortlessly beautiful game that holds your emotions in a death grip at the start of the game and never lets go. It works simultaneously as a statement on the modern political landscape but also as a tale of a man trying to do better.  These themes are not forced to remain separate, instead intertwined in an almost impossibly natural way. Just as Harry can rebuild himself, so too can the world he inhabits.\n\n\"All the gifts your parents gave you, all the love and patience of your friends, you drowned in a neurotoxin. You let misery win. And it will keep on winning till you die -- or overcome it.\"  [/spoiler]\n\nActual review notes about the game because my attempted paragraph became an essay:\n\n-music is amazing and sets the tone perfectly\n-moment to moment gameplay is fun even if getting around the map manages to be a slog\n-kim kitsuragi pls marry me\n-literally 0 bad characters even if cuno did actually almost drive me insane\n-the actual mystery is always entertaining with a satisfying payoff that ties in nicely into the games themes (maybe shouldve been looked over in the wall of text)\n-this game is fr funnier than most actual comedies", "timestamp_created": 1684801568, "timestamp_updated": 1684801614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138614631": {"recommendationid": "138614631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199838401", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3933, "last_played": 1666771651}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the greatest game I have ever played in my life.", "timestamp_created": 1684592359, "timestamp_updated": 1684592359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138450355": {"recommendationid": "138450355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308506257", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 3097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1690079444}, "language": "english", "review": "Has to be one of the top 10 rpgs of all time.

All adds to it: the music, level design and especially the narrative. Very stylish, very disco. \n- As mentioned, all the narrative part of things, the game is very creative. \n- \u0421haracters design, quests design. \n- RPG system and directions - technically not great, but in terms of immersion quite interesting. \n- The approach is more original than most of the detective games. \n\nCONS: \n- Technical system and game design. You can easily bypass the white checks with enough points for a try. F5, reload, and you've passed the check. \n- Game balance: picking clothing (which you have a lot by the end of the game), affects some metrics a lot with no need to invest points in some directions. Also see the previous note. \n- You're basically going through the story in a relatively linear manner and it's hard to miss in the end \"who's the killer\", diminishing the whole detective part. The game is however more about \"how to feel as a detective\", not really being a detective like in games from Frogwares. \n\n=>\nWant to actually solve crime - play Frogwares games. \nWant to feel like a very stylish disco RPG detective - try out Disco Elisium. \n", "timestamp_created": 1677154292, "timestamp_updated": 1677154292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133386906": {"recommendationid": "133386906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080583119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 2505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2505, "last_played": 1673995184}, "language": "english", "review": "Disco Elysium is one of the more tricky games I've ever had to talk about in any length. It's an immeasurably complex game with conversations, characters, and plot points that react to EVERYTHING you do or say. It's one of the few games I can truthfully say there is no [i]wrong[/i] way to play. The game frequently lets you say and do such incredibly stupid things that it can derail the entire game. Yet there is some comfort in this. Since Disco Elysium will respond to, and likely make fun of you no matter what you do; players are encouraged to take risks, say strange things, and interact with the world in any way they wish.\n\nThe world of Disco Elysium is daunting. There's an entire world's worth of nations, continents, history, and political movements that will be rattled off as basic fact. It's impressive the amount of care put into the game's world, but some conversations can get reallllllly wordy and will likely leave you confused. That's probably the point, but I'd only ever recommend this game to someone who doesn't mind a lot of reading.\n\nIf you can get past the obtuse structure of Disco Elysium, then you'll find yourself in a rich and vast story that ties everything you do together into a detective mystery with real stakes and a powerful message that I find myself still reflecting on.

And almost no future. [/h1]\n\nThey said disco was long dead, when I've been assigned this case, nothing unusual really, just some murder investigation, but it got quite out of hand before I could even start. [b] [ANCIENT REPTILIAN BRAIN] -  You still don't remember everything, remember? Oh, right, you DON'T! [LIMBIC SYSTEM] - Yes, Harry-boy or do you still think yourself that guy Rapha\u00ebl Ambrosius Costeau? [LOGIC] - Cut him some slack you guys, the case's been solved, at least he didn't loose his mind. [/b] Apparently I started this investigation by celebrating. I partied and didn't remember a single thing the next morning down to the world I was in. How one can party so hard you might ask, that must've been indeed some bonkers transmigrationary shindig. [b] [ENCYCLOPEDIA] - I got you, transmigration - Latin transmigrare \"to wander, move, to migrate.\" [INLAND EMPIRE] - INTO THE NETHERWORLD! [/b] And oh boy I better have not learned about it. [b] [RHETHORIC] - Envelope of matter surrounding the darkened disc of our planet. That is, if we are still living on a planet.  [/b] Knock at my mind-door brought me back to life, a mastodon, beast of prey's call to hunt. 'twas Kitsuragi's motor carriage, little did I know I had one myself, damn Jacob Irw sank it in across the canal. [b] [HAND/EYE COORDINATION] - It wasn't you was it? [/b] Helped out my brother-in-distress Garte, who's been cock-carouseled by a wily vile w\u00f6man on my way downstairs.\n\nAnd there I met him, behind Whirling In Rags hanging from a bough, the subject of examination, decomposing, reeking, being thrown rocks at, stripped of clothes, I felt sorry for him. [b] [THE HANGED MAN] - Don't pity me, coppodromo, look at you, you're practically decaying yourself. [/b] After preliminary examination and a little chit-chat with drugged kids [b] [ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY] - NOW we're talking. [VOLITION] - You're stronger than that. [/b] I proceeded to the harbor gates to get help from the self-governing authority of Evrart Claire. But before that I had to beleaguer the bulwark, bastion of a man, the measurehead. Now, I've met lotta racists in my time of service, but this one takes the cake. [b] [PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT - FORMIDABLE:FAILURE] Knock him out. [/b] Tried to grind my way past him, got humiliated and called homoerotic degenerate alcoholic instead. So I had to solve this great race enigma of his. Ever heard about cauldron of pederasty? Al Gul ridden chimeric experiments and mal-adaptations? Neither did I, overall much spicier stuff than you would hear from a fascist. So as I was saying... Evrart Claire, corpulent, sedentary mountain, who has his container moved whenever he needs to go somewhere. Said he's gonna help, find my gun, [b] -1 Morale [DRAMA] - Someone's killin' right now coppo-style. [/b] help with the case, only thing is have to do a few solids in return. Seemed like a sleazebag-kind to me, had no choice but to cooperate with him.\n\nAnd then it kinda forked from there. Moralintern, communism, elysium, cryptids, mega-rich-light-bending guy, commerce ghosts, revolutions and evolutions, you name it Revachol has and has had it all [b] [DRAMA] - FOR REVAKOL! [/b] Met heck of a lot of people there, take for example, middle-class woman, who's apparently lost her middle-class man or superstitious bookseller believing there to be a ghost of bankruptcy in her building, tried talking sense into her, she was hell-bent on that one. [b] [SHIVERS] - IT'S REAL, BEWARE OF SNAKE OIL SELLERS AND SPAMMERS! [LOGIC] - Also of a baby pale growing at your doorstep. [/b] Idiot Doom Spiral, imagine messing up your keys one day and well.. life spirals... and here you are out on a street telling stories for rotgut, no more high-concept stuff for you. Cuno, king by no choice, who DOESNT GIVE A SHIT about anythin, well his girlfriend there behind a fence may give just a little. Did I say he was baked? Kid gotta find something to focus on while zippin' high and built himself a city. [b] [REACTION SPEED] - Here in NIGHT CITY! [SUGGESTION] - The city of dre... locusts. [/b] The pigs lady - done stole my gun and fancied herself Lady Lawman from then on, lacking in hardcore though, unlike speedfreaks that I met inside a tent. Needed help setting up dance club inside a Church. Rhapsodized her innocence Dolorec Dei, made van Eyck's jam harder-core with egg-head, [b] [PERCEPTION - HEARING] - Hardcore to the mega! [/b] synched sines with Noid and ruminated a couple of his theories, and then I finally cut a rug with Andre. So I readied those old bones of mine and busted a move. He with his soft-core gyrating stood there slack-jawed admiring the master, was helluva dancing that night, even gotten lieutenant in on that. \n\nAfter all those and many other shenanigans, it was about time I returned to the case. Followed the thread like a real Dick Mullen detective I did with many a mystery yet to be tied. Still was not enough, Lely's friends caught up with us, when we met on the plaza. Lemme tell you straightaway I'm usually not the one to chicken out, but those ceramic clad mercs really put some dread into me. [b] [HORRIFIC NECKTIE] - Bratushka! You've naught to fear! Just squeeze me smack-dab into that 98.7% alcohol medicinal spirit and let's light the SHOW! [/b] No other way to solve the contretemps, but with blood, hardie boys on one side, mercenaries on another and two poor cops wedged in between. Well, squarely into his armoured chest my self-made molotov goes, [b] [PERCEPTION - VISION] - Hey, HEY TO YOUR RIGHT! [/b] turning at once I dodge the bullet by mere millimeter, double fire rings piercingly in my ears, inning of a slit in his helmet gushes out red, out of the corner of my eye I see leutenant's gun steaming; then I meet the bloodshot eyes of the first one, drunk, mad, unbelieving of his own mortality, if I'm to die I'm gonna take you with myself his gaze says. The last thing I remember, warning Kim about third one readying for the shot. [b] [ANCIENT REPTILLIAN BRAIN] - Oh no... You've just died didn't you? Look at yourself all splattered there on the Whirling's pavement, no more dancing for you, at last. [LIMBIC SYSTEM] - But what's that? The door is open and he does not take it. [PAIN THRESHOLD] - It will hurt really bad. [/b]\n\n[i] After life, death; after death, life again. [/i] Case hasn't been cracked yet and it meant only one thing - sailing to the island, the only lead we had left, that at first seemed quite implausible. Heaved boombox on my pained shoulders and sallied out along with lieutanant under saddest rock song you've ever heard. Made it to the old revolutionary flak tower and finally rested a bit. [i] The loop after loop after loop, sequence is beginning to repeat itself again, Harry. [/i] [b] [VOLITION] - You shouldn't have made that call, just forget her. [/b] [i] But he can't, his soul's hellfire's been kindled anew and thrice a week torture awaits him now. As queen regnant, Dolores Dei I ask of you to omit platitudes; let me leave, Harry I know how aggravating it is for the both of us. [/i] [b] [SUGGESTION] - No, NO! You win her back! Kiss her, she wouldn't be able to resist and you'll become a happy cop again. [/b] I'm sorry, but I can't keep go on like that, people need to move on. [/i] [b] [VOLITION] - Now what you've done? [SUGGESTION] - It's on me, I'm to blame. [/b] [i] I have a new life now Harry and you will too, joyful and affectionate, look I really need to go... [/i] You know those sorts of people who devote their entire lives to some kind of ideal and when dream breaks into smithereens, there's just nothing to replace it? Pure hatred is all that remains; well, it was this kind of patient sitting by the extinguished bonfire. [b] [INSULINDIAN PHASMID] - It must be like the highest of hells, a kaleidoscope of fire and writhing glass. Eternal damnation.

Initially, I was overwhelmed by the amount of information and tasks; the amount of location names being thrown at you all the time was an element I hated, but that is also just me and my preference. Everything else is great! I appreciate the \"point build\" system; it basically \"systemizes\" being a person (as does many other things in the game), but it also is alike D&D in that way.

This games world reflects our reality with a crazy amount of nuance but is also something with its own reality. No point in saying anymore as this game should be played blind and has a world too complex to describe anyway. \n\nYou start the game by picking your stats who act as your party and the gameplay is just reading and doing dice rolls. Your party can reveal things to you and for better or worse will give you guidance. Failed dice rolls often mean just going down a different path or seeing something different instead of just being denied something so it\u2019s usually better to keep going. Choices and even failures can pay off much later down the line. Branching paths (even from fails) and the sheer number of \u201cparty\u201d options give the game a lot of replayability. \n\nThis game has a novels worth of reading, but everything except for what your player character themselves say is fully voiced. Literally everything. Most of the credits is just voice actors and they all do an incredible job. Time was also taken to translate all the text into the game into dozens of different languages so that should not be an issue either. \n\nThere is no reason not to play Disco Elysium.

You. me? No not \u201cyou\u201d, him! Your player character, harry, tequila sunshine, detective, du boys, HIM.

That\u2019s up for you to decide, is he going to redeem himself and try to change for the better, does he think he is too far gone and gives up, or does he keep drinking to forget the pain entirely?

It's a game that challenges players to think critically and to engage with the world around them. And through its intricate storytelling and immersive gameplay, it creates a world that is both fantastical and grounded in reality.\n\nIn the end, my story may have had a happy ending, but the world of Disco Elysium is not always so forgiving. It is a world where every decision has consequences, and where the choices you make can lead to both triumph and tragedy.\n\nAs I continued to explore the city and its inhabitants, I encountered people from all walks of life, each with their own stories to tell. From the drug-addicted musician trying to make it big, to the washed-up drunk seeking redemption, to the lonely shopkeeper yearning for connection, each character was unique and complex, with their own desires and motivations.\n\nAnd as I delved deeper into their stories, I began to realize that my own journey was just a small piece of a larger tapestry. The world of Disco Elysium was vast and multifaceted, with its own history, politics, and culture. And every character, no matter how insignificant they may seem, played a role in shaping it.\n\nAs I uncovered more about the city and its people, I also began to confront my own demons. The amnesia that had plagued me since the beginning of the game was not just a plot device, but a metaphor for the struggles we all face in trying to understand ourselves and our place in the world. Through my interactions with the characters of Disco Elysium, I was forced to confront my own biases, fears, and shortcomings, and to make difficult choices that challenged my own morality and sense of self.\n\nBut despite the challenges and the darkness that lurked beneath the surface of Disco Elysium's world, there was also a sense of hope. The city was filled with people who were fighting for something, whether it was justice, freedom, or simply a better life. And even in the face of overwhelming odds, they refused to give up.\n\nPerhaps that was the most important lesson I learned from Disco Elysium: that even in a world full of corruption, injustice, and despair, there is always hope. Hope for change, hope for redemption, and hope for a better future.\n\nAs I finally reached the end of my journey, I felt a sense of accomplishment, but also a sense of longing. I didn't want to leave this world behind, with all its mysteries and complexities. But in a way, that was the beauty of Disco Elysium: it was a game that stayed with you long after the final credits had rolled, a game that made you think, feel, and reflect on the world around you.\n\nAnd so, as I put down my controller and stepped away from the screen, I knew that Disco Elysium would always be a part of me, a reminder of the power of storytelling, the importance of empathy, and the enduring nature of hope.", "timestamp_created": 1676146878, "timestamp_updated": 1685097558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132482009": {"recommendationid": "132482009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891551130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13353, "last_played": 1680396345}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

Your partner Kim is easily one of my favorite companions in any game ever. He makes you feel genuinely cared for. The whole RPG \"thought\" system where your thoughts give you varying degrees of useful advice is fantastic. Hearing your thoughts argue with each other over the best course of action is icing, and the sheer amount of varying dialogue as you proceed through the story along different paths is staggering. And I love how the game embraces failure as much as success. It's a choose-your-own-adventure book where even your slip-ups can have satisfying or even beneficial consequences.\n\nMy only warning is I could see some of this game's themes and dialogue being triggering for some people, such as addicts or the severely depressed. I can't say for sure because I was in a pretty good headspace when I played, but some of the dialogue was hitting a little too close to home at times. Still, some of it feels cathartic or almost healing.

It has a very appealing art style, a great soundtrack, phenomenal writing, hilarious comedy, and a great story with characters that feel like real people. This game is an easy 10/10 and although the gameplay is simple and may seem dull to some people, it is an amazing game that is worth sinking time in to experiencing it. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing the writing of the game is, there is just so much they did right. There is also a great sense of openness while at the same time making the player feel like they are not missing out on anything important. There are so many different ways to approach something in the game, as well as very small changes in the dialogue that are obviously affected by small observations or interactions the player had earlier that seemed pointless at the time. It is very rewarding to players who are thorough and have a wild sense of curiosity and exploration. For example, there was one person who i chose not to talk to a lot, and he ended up having a big role in the end. It does a good job of presenting a large conflict revolving around politics, while making both sides of the spectrum seem wrong, almost like no matter what side the player chooses to side with, they wrong someone. Also, it has an impressive amount of story to it. There is so much history in the world, so many backstories to learn about each and every character, such a complicated political situation going on, as well as an emotional quest of self identification about the main character.

It leans heavily on its dialogue, art direction and style and charm and it pays off in spades for this.\nThe main gripes I have with the game is that if you've done everything you can do in a day you just kind of get stuck talking to people you've already talked to and hearing things you've already heard,\nand that the first time I died I hadn't saved for ages as I didn't know that talking to a racist would nearly kill me.\nBut otherwise every stylistic and story based element of this game is polished to a blinding sheen with art and characters that have stuck into me like shrapnel.\nIts a lovley game and while I wouldn't recommend it to everyone,\nHoly shit do I love talking about and my interactions with this game :)", "timestamp_created": 1672370157, "timestamp_updated": 1672370157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128845744": {"recommendationid": "128845744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041641124", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2772, "last_played": 1671332140}, "language": "english", "review": "A work of art", "timestamp_created": 1671447548, "timestamp_updated": 1671447548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127868998": {"recommendationid": "127868998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846533903", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2546, "last_played": 1673128519}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Disco Elysium and how it affected a struggling artist[/h1]\nNot only is this game a massive plus on my end, but it's worth every single penny\nLemme go through the list\n\n[b] Story 10/10 [/b]\nThe writing is the work a master and the characters actually feel human. They process info and you can picture in your brain what they are doing in the form of the quotes and labelled motions. This entire game feels like a 5000 word book that is interesting to read and figure out every single mystery. All the writing is fantastically detailed and the voice acting is marvelous, with their character portraits and models syncing with the voice acting perfectly, making the characters feel alive and fleshed out into the story. With so many options to choose on how to interact with the characters, the options on how you make your cop are nearly limitless. Some loose ends like The Pale and some optional side characters never do get tied up but that's because the game never tells that story for only one reason\n\nThe story is about a cop named Harrier Du Bois, solving a murder with his partner Kim Kirsuragi\n\nThat's it, and that's the story in the end. You can find all the phasmids, study all the races, become the biggest drunk, the strangest communist or even the sorriest cop, but the end, the overall story through all of it is that you are a police officer on a case to solve murder mystery. But they pad this game so much, it turns 5 hours into 40, and when you finish the game, there's still threads you can tie up and places to find. The game only ends when YOU decide to turn the final page, when YOU decide to do everything you can in this world, and when YOU want it to truly leave you satisfied\n\n[b] Gameplay 9/10 [/b]\nThe game play directly headbutts the story by making it so whatever skills you pick become your actual being. You can choose skills that make you the most intelligent man but your hand eye coordination is dreadful or even a build stack of bricks but dumb as a box in a box of rocks. All the skill have really fun chatter and can really have an impact on how the story pans out.\n\nOutside of all that, the running around can be a bit confusing with some of the pathways. It feels a bit bland with some of the walking and interacting and more walking but trust me when I say, it could have been WAY WAY worse. But then again, walking never hurt no one.\n\n[b] Art 10/10 [/b]\nThe art in this game is beautiful beyond reproach. The every area feels like a painting, all the structures feel like sculptures and the portraits need to be hung in a museum. All its character and skill portraits colors perfectly complements the characters personalities. The art style for things like the [Insuldian Phasmid] and the Title Screen feel almost otherworldly, like its all alien. The beautiful landscapes and industrial feel of the Union/ Revolution feel cold and metallic. The gorgeous views give way to some of the best artistic talent I have seen in a game. There's almost not words to describe how drawable this game really is.\n\nIt is sad to see that the original people who worked on the game won't be returning to ZA/UM but that brings me to a revitalizing conclusion\n\nDisco Elysium 2 can be [i] anything [/i]\n\nCould be a book, a board game, or even an animated series. The concept of Disco Elysium is not defined by the people who made it, its by the people who were truly touched by it. This is a game where the plot can be expanded by virtually anyone. From people who want a more in depth look into Cuno as a character or a more detailed view into The Pale, Disco Elysium leaves untied threads that anyone can tie back up. Not satisfied with the Revolutions sudden conclusion? Make a comic detailing how [The Deserter] and Rene had a rivalry that could start another revolution.\n\nThis game leaves so much to the imagination that an entire WORLD could be made with this one game alone. Endless worlds to be written and countless adventures, phasmid to ghost, can be detailed. As an artist who has once dabbled in wanting to end my existence, this game shows that in the 80-90 years you have on this planet, adventure always finds a way to move you. Skipping class, getting into fights, discovering fossils, to getting married, nothing is not off the table until the world ends. You may not have the power to adjust your fate, but you can always watch and see what happens. Let the world tie your threads, and maybe the people along the way can show you your true path. Now this suicidal talk was years ago but playing this game recently made me realize that suicide can be dripped down into something as simple as pressing STOP...\n\nBut its those who push forwards through the pale and see the tape recorder of life\nThose who reach their hand through the pain\nThose who find that glimmer of hope\nWill press PLAY\nAnd meet this world with new eyes\nThis planet will die and shrivel\nBut that doesn't mean you don't have to watch it thrive", "timestamp_created": 1670103864, "timestamp_updated": 1670103864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126031264": {"recommendationid": "126031264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976385864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1205, "last_played": 1669645967}, "language": "english", "review": "please let me kiss kim in disco boogie 2", "timestamp_created": 1669149442, "timestamp_updated": 1669149442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125961509": {"recommendationid": "125961509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049302966", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6686, "last_played": 1670614657}, "language": "english", "review": "I promise, this is the last time I am playing this game", "timestamp_created": 1669142719, "timestamp_updated": 1669142719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124431443": {"recommendationid": "124431443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171085646", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1666979416}, "language": "english", "review": "less than a dollar", "timestamp_created": 1666810287, "timestamp_updated": 1666810287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123717640": {"recommendationid": "123717640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088465314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 3093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2531, "last_played": 1689762446}, "language": "english", "review": "It's one of those games where you hear about it from your nerdy friend, get sick of hearing about it so you push it aside, and play it half a year later, only to hate on yourself for not starting sooner (thank you my nerdy friends).

I don't know how to put it, but moving on, I didn't even play for two hours.\n\nAfter three months of forcing myself to finish this product, I came back to it.

This is a game for readers, as everything is conveyed through text, though the brilliant voice acting is extremely helpful if you'd rather listen than read. If you can get past the hurdle of reading everything and a slightly frustrating walking speed, I have no other complaints about Disco Elysium. Every character is interesting, the game's visuals are gorgeous, the music is outstanding. There was never a time that I felt lost or that I ran out of things to do, the game is constantly and consistently engaging.

I found that 22 hours strangely satisfying, albeit odd. The dark humor, awkward storyline filled with disturbing characters and long, tragic ramblings of your character aren't for everyone, but they are unique to Disco Elysium. \n\nThere is very little \"gameplay\" per se, as Disco Elysium is more of an experience/graphic novel than a typical game. For that reason, I'm not considering gameplay in my review.\n\nI loved the art style and the ability to meander in a unique, beautiful world without losing progress toward solving the main mystery. I also liked that you can fail or ignore certain quests and still find another way to succeed. This game truly is a mystery solving game as it is almost impossible to guess what's coming next in a first play through. I don't know that I've ever been surprised by the ending in a \"mystery\" game before which is why I typically avoid the genre. Kudos to the writers for finding a way to keep the storyline engrossing with multiple side plots running throughout. \n\nWhile I don't always take artwork and music into consideration when reviewing games, I must in this case. The beautiful, truly-unique artwork set in a world full of the unexpected and odd, combined with exceptional, distinctive music contributes significantly to the enjoyability of the game. \n\nUnfortunately, the first play through is all you really get. While I know some players enjoy subsequent save games, I don't really see how that would be rewarding at all. For me, discovering the world and solving the mysteries were the only truly interesting parts of the game, so I have zero desire to go back and play it again. For this reason, I would only recommend buying this game on a good sale, as I don't feel it's worth the full purchase price.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game while it lasted and loved the unique artwork and concept. If it weren't for the lack of replayability, and consequently, the high price for what you get, I'd give it a 9/10. \n\nGameplay: NA \nStoryline and Quests: 8/10\nWorld: 9/10\nCharacters: 8/10\nArt and Music: 10/10\nReplayability: 1/10\nPrice: 6/10\nOverall: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1692635448, "timestamp_updated": 1692635448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144724038": {"recommendationid": "144724038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239677746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1652, "last_played": 1692597093}, "language": "english", "review": "the first time booting this game up and i tried to grab my tie from the ceiling fan and failed the roll check, my character instantly had a heart attack and died, this was after i spent like 15 minutes making my custom character and i forgot to save at the beginning.", "timestamp_created": 1692633078, "timestamp_updated": 1692633078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143662000": {"recommendationid": "143662000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027044402", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2793, "last_played": 1691020417}, "language": "english", "review": "Do it for the puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1691511166, "timestamp_updated": 1691511166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142111541": {"recommendationid": "142111541", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056041106", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1944, "last_played": 1689402716}, "language": "english", "review": "I was unintentionally a facist, racist, ultranationalist woman hater, and my net worth was 2 billion.

Everything is a dialogue. Talking, exploring, sleeping... even combat. Do you like dialogues? Then this game is for you. And it's one of the best games in existence. Even if you usually skip text in games and \"want to get to the good part\" you should give it a chance.\n\nThe writing is really good. Not video-game good, but plain good. That's not something that happens often. And there's a lot of writing. You will spend 40 hours reading, and you probably won't see everything anyway.\n\nDisco Elysium has pretty interesting approach on stats, which are nothing like in D&D or typical games, where you would get your strength and charisma. Here most of the stats are aspects of your personality, even the more physical oriented ones. You can have Logic, which is part of intellectual block, but also Rhetoric, Drama, Conceptualization and so on. And that's only for Intellect. But you have 4 main stats, each with multiple facets.\n\nIt can be a little overwhelming during character creation, so for the first go I suggest taking one of the prebuilt characters.\n\nThe \"aspects of personality\" thing doesn't end there. During the game all aspects will run background checks to see if they notice something or have something to add. If they do they will appear as thoughts inside your dialogue. Multiple aspects can even talk to each other and argue between themselves. They will sometimes give you clues what to answer (which are not always the best answers). As you invest into different aspects they will become more and more active in your discussions.\n\nMost of the gameplay is focused on traversing dialogue trees. There will often be more than 8 options to choose from. Whole screen of options. And you can go trough them from top to bottom, and ask about everything. Like the good policeman that you are. Sometimes though, you will have more important choices where you can select only one thing, only once. Very often the options you will have will be VERY politically charged. You can go around spewing right wing propaganda, or left wing propaganda, or even be a nationalist, or a communist. And no one will really do much about it, because you have the authority. It's very interesting to see such broad spectrum of possibilities, and not be limited to be a \"goody person\" vs \"most evil human who ever lived\". You can also talk about disco days 20 times a day, or spew out supercop, or boring cop lines. It's up to you.\n\nThe story is about recent hanging murder that you, and your new partner Kim, are trying to solve. There are many tangled threads that lead to the situation at hand. It doesn't help that you went for a drunken stupor for the last week, and you don't remember anything you did... while everyone seems to know you very well from that time. Go figure. The character you play as, despite having stats according to you, has basis of their being predefined. And they are pretty broken person. Very interesting to read.\n\nNow, the game is not perfect. It bases on tests made with 2d6, which can be rather swingy. Every point in the skill also adds a lot in the \"chances to succeed\" category. When you play the game you'll find a lot of the equipment, and each piece of equipment changes your stats a bit. So if you run into important test (they are marked by red color), which cannot be replied, very often you'll say \"bye\" to the person you're talking to, change your clothes to get better scores, and then go back to the test. The further you are the harder tests become, and you might be doing your clothes swapping every few minutes. That gets old fast. Also, it leads to some save scumming, especially if you fail 90% chance test... 7 times in a row.\n\nThere are also white tests, which can be repeated, but you need to increase relevant score to \"unlock\" this test if you failed before. Only increasing the skill by leveling up counts. That means you'll soon find out it's worth not leveling up when you level up. Instead it's good to stock up on points so you can allocate them to pass harder red tests or to have an ability to retry a test. The game actually has few places where you might lock yourself from progressing the game. Fortunately it's rather hard to do.\n\nThere's also a system where you can get some concepts, that your mind will \"process\" in the back of your head while you're doing other things. When the brain is processing you get a debuff, but when the brain finishes you get a buff. But sometimes it's a debuff. Or a buff that does nothing for you. Or a buff you don't want. You can't check what each concept will give you, until you spend hours \"investigating\" it. That's unnecessary obfuscation of information, and I doubt anyone uses this system without consulting a wiki.\n\nFinally there's time passage system. The time passes only while in dialogue. You can walk for miles without a second passing, but then you can bugger an innocent woman for hours on end if she REALLY doesn't have any job for a policeman. The thing is, you also have to pay for your hotel, and if you don't the game promises to give you a game over. I don't know if that's true, but at some point you can get rid of the money problem, and at that point the game gets a lot better.\n\nThis game also allows you to assign a button to switch between two languages. I found it very useful, as English is not my primary language. Disco Elysium has a lot of rare, hard vocabulary, not to mention fictional political scene. Sometimes I would have trouble understanding the game, and being able to switch to my native language with a press of a button was a godsent.\n\nI also have to give kudos to the voice actor who narrates everything. That's some really hypnotizing voice, and man, it gives the game special tone, like no other. Raspy, slow, hypnotizing. \n\nOverall the game is awesome. Unforgettable story and the characters. Could be better with ability to make few equipment presets (to ease up on equipment changes) and some ironing out of the quirks. But where it counts - in the writing - it's just 10/10.

It kinda resonates with my frustration with Baldur's Gate, Pillars of Eternity etc. for their obsession with throwing a huge amount of useless, boring, and meaningless combat against you instead of exploring the narration a bit more. This game doesn't really do combat. Not in the traditional sense anyway.\n\u2714\ufe0f The narrative flow is very engaging, always encouraging you to explore the game's scene a bit further with clear goals that still require to look around a bit, and things you can come back to later to retry a check you have failed.\n\u2714\ufe0f The story itself is intriguing, the starting situation deals very well with the player not knowing much about the universe, and the colorful roster of characters really drags you into the plot.\n\u2714\ufe0f The character progression is very smart, deeply entwined with the narration. There aren't really any \"losing\" builds, and you can progressively adapt your character to the solutions you want to bring to your problems.\n\u2714\ufe0f The ambience focusing on misery, desolation, and discontent, while still leaving some space to people just living their lives is wonderfully transmitted to the player. The game manages to be both bleak and flavorful.\n\u2714\ufe0f The environments are beautiful, the music enjoyable, and the 2D art simply stunning. The game is an actual work of art.\n\n\u274c A few minor bugs (unfitting voicelines, broken camera positions, and the journal not removing some checks you cannot retry anymore).\n\nOverall, that's an absolute, definite, and complete recommendation for anyone with the tiniest speck of love for interactive narration.

I would read up on this and consider it before purchasing this game. Or find alternative means to play this game.\n\n[h1] Main review: [/h1]\nThis is it. This is the one.\nOnce in every few years a game will come along that completely surprises, innovates, and pushes the boundaries of storytelling in interactive media. And this is it.\n\nDisco Elysium is a game set in a fictional almost dystopian or alternative earth type setting with a rich history and compelling characters.\nIt feels real. It feels rough. It\u2019s bizarre yet completely believable.\nLike Tolkien would write the world of Middle earth first and then set a story in it, this too feels like the world was created first, and then a story was settled within it.\nIt\u2019s hard to explain Disco Elysium itself. It\u2019s a videogame but at the same time it\u2019s more than that.\nIt talks about socio-economics, it talks about politics, it talks about failure and the nature of humanity. It goes deep sometimes. Sometimes confusingly deep that you have no idea what dark well you jumped into this time.\nIn the core essence however, it\u2019s a detective game. You are a detective sent out to solve a murder investigation. Your main job is to figure out who did it, how it was done, why it was done. Alongside with you is Kim Kitsuragi, your partner, someone you\u2019ve never met before.\nIt might be good to mention you have Amnesia. Another clich\u00e9 trope in videogame narrative but executed very well within Disco Elysium. It\u2019s an important part of the entire game as you struggle to figure out the sense of everything around you.\nYou progress your investigation with the help of your attributes which are subdivided with skills you can level up. You level up, you put your skillpoints in the skills. The skills however are something completely different than what you\u2019re used to. Some are familiar, others seem completely bizarre. A personal favorite of mine is the \u201cInland Empire\u201d, which checks your inner thoughtspace and questions the bizarre and dreamlike feelings you might have.\nA lot of this doesn\u2019t make sense when explaining it. It\u2019s one of those \u201cYou have to play it to get it\u201d cases.\nYou meet a lot of characters along the way, some grow on you depending on your actions, some don\u2019t. Some are rude, some are too nice. It\u2019s up to you to figure out who might be connected to the case or not. Either way it might not even matter, maybe there\u2019s a bigger point to it all.\n\nAs I mentioned before failure, is a part of this game. You will fail checks, regularly. This is ok. The game will in most cases even the most desperate cases continue even after you fail. Failing is part of life and thus part of you. Learn to accept it if you can. Failing a check also doesn\u2019t mean you cannot try again. White checks allow you to try again later or when you\u2019ve placed a new skillpoint in the skill being checked.\n\nTo put Disco Elysium into words it feels like a dark black ocean.\nIt pulls you under, down the black waves. There\u2019s despair there but also hope and at the very bottom a twisting vortex.\nIt lets you go to momentarily catch your breath but then quickly pulls you down again.\nThe vortex at the bottom beckons. Is it absolution? The end? Or a completely new beginning?\nYou\u2019ll find out.", "timestamp_created": 1672672203, "timestamp_updated": 1672672203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

However, i do believe i got one of the best ending humanly possible for a first run with no scum saving. I even saw the big stick with kimmy! Spoilers ahead [spoiler] My first gripe is about that damned wall. I wish someone would have told me for the boardwalk shot i for some reason need to pass a ridiculously hard shivers check to progress the game. I got stuck for 5 hours before i had to look up how to even advance through the game there are IIRC two other walls with white skill checks that give some dialog. I assumed it was like that. I'm not as mad about the two guarenteed fails, but i would appreciate if it wouldn't give me dice rolls to trick me. And the ending...The actual man who took the shot is not access-able until the very end game. It felt like a punch in the gut to realize that all my detective work and suspect list didnt matter at all since the char who actually did it was tucked away on some island, very eager to admit he's the one who killed the guy. It felt almost like a cop-out. If i read correctly, there are no definite fails either. A few quirky game overs for certain events, but i dont think you can just straight up fail the case, which will give second playthroughs a much more un-urgent feel. It took me three in game days before i basically hit end game at the boardwalk shot. I practically did every quest, even with egg head and them. The only quest i couldn't figure out how to do was get the basement door open and get the boots. Coupled with how you have 10 in game days before you run out of time (The game iirc just asks if you want to load an earlier save) makes me realise how actually redundant the time limit is. The game told me choices mattered alot, but in the grand scheme of things, i only see a handful of dialog options that actually mattered. And again, i do feel very cheated that the guy who actually shot was some nobody tucked away on an island i can only access with 1 hour left before finishing the game. It felt rushed, it felt creatively devoid but most of all it felt lazy. It felt as if the beggining of the game was all the cool ideas and the middle-end game was trying to wrap up what they made. Oh, and he's 100% always the guy who does it. You always have the same convo with him. The only thing that matters if you did some dialog options in the begining of the game. There are 3 major endings from what ive read. None of them too different from each other. [/spoiler] All in all. The game is great. Very fun. I wouldn't go as far as the say intelligence demanding, but oh well. Do not buy at full price, definitely not worth 40 bucks. I picked it up for 10.

Many of the characters are extremely memorable and a lot of the game's humour landed, which is still rare in video games.\nUnfortunately there are a number of flies in the ointment:\nThe actual mechanics of moving your character and interacting with objects feels cumbersome and annoying.\nYour partner, Kim Kitsuragi, follows you around jittering and stuttering as he runs and the overall performance of the game appears unpolished.\nThere were moments where I got soft-locked because the game just didn't load a scene properly.\nEarly on I got a game over for literally no reason and throughout the story random, innocuous decisions led to negative results that couldn't possibly be predicted.\nOne of the central plot devices is the tired old trope of your character having amnesia, which always leaves a bad taste in the mouth.\nTowards the end of the game it piles on new skill points for your character, all of which are completely unnecessary as the game is about to end after endless reams of dialogue which you can barely influence.\nI could go on with the minor gripes...\nBy far the biggest problem with the game is the ending, which is hugely disappointing. It leaves you feeling flat, like a film with an intriguing premise which it squanders and throws away in the final act. Once the final reveal happens it's really just a rush to get the game over with. I'm not going to say any more in case it spoils someone else's enjoyment but having looked online I am not the only person to voice their negative opinion.\nSo, do I really recommend the game? Yeah, I think so. The writing is good, the first two thirds of the game is very compelling and it provokes quite a bit of self reflection.

But this game warrants it.\n\nWith over fifty hours clocked into the Kurvitz's universe of Elysium, among the characters of this game, with all forty achievements unlocked and every combination, path and variation of the story experience, I can only say this: Play this game.\n\nDo whatever you need to play this game, but play it. It doesn't matter if you're not a story-driven game enthusiast. It doesn't even matter if you're a gamer to begin with. This is by far one of the most artistically realised pieces of artwork made for the video game medium, and much like I would urge you to watch the great movies made for film as a way to understand what cinema is, I urge you to play Disco Elysium to understand what video games are, what they can and should be.\n\nThere is no fluff. No B-S. Everything is an intricate piece of an incredibly complex, yet well-oiled story, supported by a previously thought of dead genre, redefined and revamped for the modern audience. Classical RPGs haven't been around for a while, and for good reason. This game changes that. It makes you want more cRPGs, which is a feat all on its own, because they can seriously get repetitive and similar between each of them. The mechanics, the way the game handles, how it presents itself... I can't properly do it justice.\n\nGet it full price if you have the funds. Get it on sale if you want to save money. I would even tell you to get it from a friend, or somewhere else, if it means you can play it. This game -will- go down in history as the precursor to the beginning of an era of greatness, a way for people to experience a narrative in such a polished manner that you don't even notice you're playing a game.\n\nIt's not quite like reading a book.

This game was a delight to play through!\n\nIt has a long list of pros. From its uniquely apt psychological narration, to the ways the skills all interface with dialogue prompts. Nothing is left out, and nothing feels out of place as a unique mechanic versus everything else. It ends up being a very insightful way to handle character progression in an RPG. One of the best I've seen done in the past generation of top-down, Isometric revival.\n\nThe story is also pretty excellent. It's slow burn at a start, but once I hit Day 2, I started running full speed ahead. I did a great deal of digging in what felt like no time at all. Though, the gameplay hours were definitely there, and I enjoyed them all.\n\nThere are some small quibbles. \"Combat\" doesn't have a place like it does in other c-RPGs, and that might let people down. I don't really see it as being too bad. Things are very minimal, and the core gameplay loop never changes. Scrounge for insight in your surroundings, and interact with NPCs to get the job done.\n\nI feel like I had a pretty epic playthrough doing a 4 Int, 3 Psy, 2 Mot, and 1 Fsy custom class. But you REALLY need to be ready to make some decisions and round out.\n\nAlso, the game doesn't really tell you this, but a rating of about 6 in a skill makes it pretty much always possible (if still unlikely for Impossible checks) to get a success. So, I typically di dn't level anything over 8, because at that point, I was gettin some 96-98% checks.\n\nStill, I really think this game touched on something that lots of other games could learn from. It really observed its genre, and it tackled it expertly.\n\nNow, there is something to be said about how the game handles political critiques. If you're sensitive to such, the game will slap you in the face. There's some talk that Communism gets the least criticism in this game, and that tracks. I think the game t ries to balance it by bringing nuance to the table about different Left Wing Thought, but it doesn't really go anywhere beyond that.\n\nEveryone gets made fun of politically though, so, wouldn't be too worried about it.", "timestamp_created": 1676287217, "timestamp_updated": 1676287217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506849288940429688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128410010": {"recommendationid": "128410010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198931532616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1668658982}, "language": "english", "review": "Communism good", "timestamp_created": 1670825071, "timestamp_updated": 1670825071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506849288940429688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135222207": {"recommendationid": "135222207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982206774", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2590, "last_played": 1693677466}, "language": "english", "review": "fucking \u007f\u007fgame ruined my life\ninterested in some gendarme funk? never want to be able to play another game again without comparing it to this one? wanna fall in love with a fictional raging alcoholic and a compulsive liar? who's also mentally ill?

The skill checks are interesting, with the game giving you plenty of opportunities to show off the skills you leveled up (and the ones that you didn't lol). My only minor nitpick is that the interface is sometimes fussy if you try to use drug items (the hitbox to click to use drugs is quite small and makes it look like you can't use the item). Again, you should know that this is mostly a talking game. A LOT of it. I actually like that the game doesn't put you in many fights or violent scenarios because I didn't feel desensitized to violence like I would be in a first-person-shooter. When a character could get seriously hurt or die, my heart was genuinely pounding.

First up it's a visual novel so if you are not into visual novels or dialogue heavy games, the game is not for you, if you are into them I can't recommend it more, and if you just wanna try out the genre then you'll not be disappointed.\n\nDisco's unique character creation process is by far my most favorite thing about this game. you make your character (who starts out as an amnesic cop that's trying to solve a murder mystery) by assigning points in different aspects and traits of your character, like his authority, empathy, logic, endurance, and so many other traits that are usual and others that are absolute bat shit crazy, depending on which aspects you invested in you get prompts from different \"sides\" of your brain and personality that basically affects how you interact with the characters around you and how you respond to different situations.\nThat alone boosts the replay value of this game alot, since you'll always be wondering about the different ways you could have cleared certain encounters, or about some dialogue you missed and other stuff like that.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience all around with an engaging story, a well written cast of characters, amazing dialogue, and stellar voice acting performance 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1669435029, "timestamp_updated": 1669435029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504166662693023682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127999359": {"recommendationid": "127999359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021047150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1996, "last_played": 1690286986}, "language": "english", "review": "Just play this game.

An rpg game that does justice to the rpg genre. In Disco Elysium you are a detective, trying to solve a murder case. There is a small town and in this small town there are many different NPCs that have an enormous depth. Even the inanimated objects are interesting to interact with. This game is basically contains 3 mechanics, you explore the town, you talk to people which can be included in the exploration and there is a check system, just like in Dungeons and Dragons where there is a dialogue that says you can do this with a 58% chance of success. Depending on luck you can do that or not. And the best part is, not all the success' are a good outcome, as same as not all the unsuccessful checks are a bad outcome. You should play this game without quick save-quick loading because that what makes this game a true experience. \n\nThis game is dialogue - text heavy. To be honest, when I first started playing the game, I couldn't go for more than 1 hours for each session but as the game unraveled itself, I couldn't stop playing. But you should be aware that, if you're not into text-heavy games, this one might take some getting used to but it'll get so much better as the game progresses.\n\nThe world is crafted in a way and the NPCs explain the history of the world you're living in such fashion that it feels like the game's world is much closer to real world than it what really is, a fiction world. Each character is greatly fleshed out, some of the conversations with NPCs took 20+ real life minutes to finish which can look much but it gave great depths to the world and its characters.\n\nVoice acting was superb, one of the best. Story was great, side quests again fleshed the game and the world and also some of the side quests tied some unexpected loose ends. \n\nSoundtrack was also great, Whirling Rags tune is addicting.\n\nOverall, what a great game, a forgotten genre.

Beautiful art, beautiful voice acting, beautiful writing. It's hilarious, unhinged, very real, and startlingly insightful.\n\nThe characters and dialog choices feel like they're turned up to 11, taking some particular worldview to an extreme (including centrism). But rather than feel absurd, the game achieves a level of nuance that would be difficult to convey otherwise. Even when various positions come off as unhinged, they feel like they were written with a tender intimacy. The nuance is in the understanding it takes to write these extreme characters and know them as they know themselves. The game is brimming with brokenness: depression, substance abuse, violence, corruption, exploitation. There are very few unambiguously good or healthy people in this game. And yet, the game is not cynical. It somehow manages to hold all this brokenness with a tenderness for humanity. The worst of humanity is not judged so much as mourned.\n\nAlso, it's an incredible exploration of heartbreak and grief. The negative self-talk, the unfounded hope that there's some way to win it back, the endless pain and desire to do anything to end it, the incessant intrusion of memory. It's all spot on. So is damaging your well-being by giving into the worst of these reactions. I'm recently divorced and the game was quite triggering. And yet it made me appreciate that I really was damaging myself with my mental dialog. \n\nI've only played through once so far and found it extremely rich. I suspect I have only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. I can't wait to play it again from a different angle.", "timestamp_created": 1694071808, "timestamp_updated": 1694071808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50354611873626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125115930": {"recommendationid": "125115930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974756212", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "playtime_at_review": 387, "last_played": 1695959096}, "language": "english", "review": "For those unaware, the company that actually gets the money from Steam purchases, ZA/UM, fired the entire creative team which actually created the writing and setting of Disco Elysium.

My playtime may say different but I played through this game at least six times and I'm writing this way after the fact, realizing how many negative reviews I wrote. So let me say one thing right off the bat...\n\nThis is the best written game I have ever played.\n\nI won't go so far to say it's the best written game ever - I would sound ignorant I'm afraid. But I have seen sooo much trash writing in my life (a lot of it japanese in origin). Even games I thought were adequate up to this point seem laughable compared to this. I still have some further inquires to do. Disco Elysium has inspirations I'm sure. Planescape Torment, for instance, which has also very high quality writing I hear and is unique in many ways.\n\nThere is a lot to be said. I will never do this game justice but I need some kind of representation of my love somewhere on the internet before I'm dust and shadow so here we go. No spoilers by the way.\n\nThe world is deep and rich in lore. There is lots and lots of hidden stuff, like dialogue lines and scenes you are surprised to find after you exhausted every way of playing this game with all possible builds. Or at least think you did. It stays fresh for a long time and there are many sophisticated concepts you need to read or hear a couple of times to fully understand. \n\nThe story is deeply compelling and so are the game mechanics. Although I hate amnesia as a trope in other media since it is almost always a sign of lazy writing, Disco Elysium made it an intergral part of its narrative. It wasn't thrown in after the fact. It is still used to delay several revelations and twists but you play a detective so it fits. And the world is so alien and fascinating. The character you play as lives in this world but knows nothing about it when the game starts. Just like you, so amnesia helps to have exposition and you will need a lot of that. It could not happen in its entirety on Earth, though. Only the base plot line which is what keeps you grounded. But apart from that, learning all those differences to our reality is interesting. Everything is a mystery. It's poetic and generously researched. Tons of talent and effort were put into every detail it's jaw dropping.\n\nFor a role-playing game this plays rather uniquely. While other titles of the genre focus a lot on combat, there is very little actual role-playing in them, even if they are based on pen and paper franchises. You only encounter a couple of skill checks in them. But since Disco Elysium has no combat there is a lot more weight on how you interact with your surroundings and the people inhabiting them. The synergy between your skills and the dialogue is an outstanding chacteristic in this game, because you talk to your skills - or rather parts of your psyche and body that give guidance or try to influence you. And the thought cabinet is such a creative and original mechanic. I played this game for hundreds of hours and still have not seen all of its content or got all thoughts. Sure you can force successes using save files but in this game it is okay to fail. I would encourage everyone to embrace their unlucky dice rolls or bad decisions and just go with it. If only for hilarity's sake.\n\nWhile this game provides intellectual stimuli in strokes, it is also very emotional. It is usually one or the other. Some games are more philosophical or political and other games are tear jerkers or comedies. Disco Elysium has a lot to say about the world, culture and the human condition but it is also funny as hell! I laughed tears multiple times! But I was also disturbed, moved, inspired, irritated and blown away how ingenious and well thought out some things are. Really cathartic this game. Really satisfying.\n\nIt helped to have more audio which was added with the final cut. The graphics are nice from a conceptional angle, but there is very little movement and not a lot of variety visually.

It's a great murder mystery that has a plethora of interesting twist and turns. I'll start by saying the design is amazing; the game looks and feels extremely unique and I've never seen anything quite like it, aesthetically speaking. It has some great humor, stunning visuals, and a plethora of well-designed, interesting characters. The music is nice. Pretty much everything about how this game looks is good.\n\nThe gameplay is lacking. There's a *lot* of things that make this game downright inconvenient to play, such as main story events being locked behind speech checks. The speech checks and time mechanics don't really do much besides force you to wait, and a HUGE chunk of the dialogue in this game is irrelevant flavor text. This is an otherwise great game that's severely held back by just how much of a CHORE it is to progress through certain plotlines; it would be better if you only had to wait a few hours/a day to redo most of the checks. Some checks seem to refresh themselves even if you DIDN'T level up at all, which makes this system even more confusing than it needs to be. Walking around is very slow and the fast travel system doesn't help at all, only working halfway through the game and only working in very specific areas. The way time works in this game is downright annoying, especially if you are reaching endgame where killing time is very hard.\n\nThe game is also buggy and unpolished. Some voice lines will not match what is written. Some voice lines are ridiculously loud and will come out of nowhere (it's clearly not intentional when this happens). \n\nThe writing in this game is really good. It knows when to be serious and when to be funny. The main plot is good and most of the subplots are entertaining at the very least. I don't like how dense the writing gets at some points, though. There are a LOT of details in this game that isn't very relevant towards the story, and while some things do add flavor to the game, I think a hefty chunk of the dialogue would have been better off left out. The game is already long enough as is.\n\nOverall a pretty solid game. The writing is amazing in some parts, but this game does suffer from a lot of issues with regards to polish and length.

I also enjoy reading history books and political essays. So I was shocked that this game was so bad. Disco Elysium is an exposition dump. It would be like reading the world building texts of Tolkien, without ever getting the LOTR content where you actually care about the characters and environment first. And speaking of comparing it to a novel...\n\nSadly, Disco Elysium is a visual novel, not a game. There is nothing game-like about it. I knew there was an issue in the very beginning when it was clear that you're supposed to make (at least 3) replays of the story. How is that supposed to be engaging in a murder mystery? There's only 1 logical conclusion to any murder. When you solve it, you're going to be starting the rest of the other replays knowing the end. (I also Googled the \"multiple endings\" that you can get. They are practialy the same.)\n\nFurthermore, you can't even read this visual novel at a reasonable pace because the main character runs like a snail. You also need to double-click to run. Don't know why there isn't an auto-run option. The maps are also unnecessarily long-winded when this could be easily fixed by unlockable short cuts. The fast-travel mechanic is a joke. I doubt most people even knew it was there. You're also held back by progression due to SKILL CHECKS BASED ON PROBABILITY. It makes you want to die when you fail a 80% roll because you're going to have to wait until the next day to retry. You also need to level up your skill again, and gaining experience points is very tedious work. And you're an absolute sucker if you think you can fast forward time. This core mechanic of probability checks doesn't make me happy to level up. If anyone reading this is still going to play the game, just save scum.\n\nSpeaking of skills, you have to spend your experience points into 24 slots- WAY too much. In the beginning, I was lost on which of the 24 to invest in, and I would pick ones that weren't helpful to my current quest, essentially wasting it. There's also no mention that you need to save these exp points in order to forget or unlock more thoughts. The grinding for exp points was never fun. Most of the actions will give you +5 exp only. You need 100 to get to the next level.\n\nAlso, the game- the \"FINAL CUT\"- is glitchy. Shouldn't have been released like this. The music will blare randomly. There's a lot of overlapping issues. The voice acting options only work half the time. The \"next\" button to progress the text doesn't show up sometimes. How is the text-heavy game going to flop so hard on its main function?\n\nEnough critique, I'm just going to roast this game now, so these are just personal opinions:\n1) The voice acting for the different skills is cringe as hell. I liked the other characters' voice acting (for the most part), but I had to play the game on silent. My least favorite actors were the ones in the dream sequence and the fucking talking tie.\n\n3) I hate the main character. He's absolutely pathetic, and I don't believe that he could have ever been a good detective considering the absolutely childish dialogue options you can choose. Some people found it \"funny\", but I found it immersion-breaking. I hate that when you fail the stupid dice roll checks, you CAN'T fail it gracefully. For example, when asking out a girl, you won't get something like: \"You didn't manage to get any words out.\" You'll fail spectaculously like; \"Do u want sum fuk?\"\n\n4) It's just boring to read. I don't care about the revolution. I barely care about the current citizens. This is mostly because having a normal conversation is not allowed. DISCO ELYSIUM CITIZENS TRY TO NOT MAKE THEIR PERSONALITY ABOUT THE REVOLUTION/ THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS/ RACISM CHALLENGE (IMPOSSIBLE).\n\n5) The writer clearly thinks that more text = good writing.\n\nThe Good:\nThe art and music (when its not glitching out).

Honestly masterpiece level material in the most sincere way.\n\nThe writing for this game, bolstered by the voice acting, becomes above and beyond anything I could have expected. There is a lot of stuff IN the game, but I think the thing it does best is give the player a valuable experience. \n\nLess about finding every single thing there is to find and more about how the things you find for yourself are distinctly meaningful. Getting to see dialogue that feels like it is specially for the thing you did is a great feeling.\n\nI went in knowing very little and this became like my little gaming Cowboy Bebop. I started it like 3 times and stopped for no reason even though I loved it. Eventually though, I finished Bebop and the same with Elysium. When I did, I found a work that I felt was truly special. An impressive sense of space, style, tone and voice; something I will think about for a long long time. \n\nThe story of this game has some seriously dour notes, but comes out the end with a compassion and vitality that makes the heart sing. Things can and will go wrong, for me they went so so wrong, (some WILD pace in this game) but the world kept turning, and despite the mistakes everything turned out hopeful. \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo things from me:\n\n1. uh stick bug storyline, hmm. feels to me like the focus is taken off of martinaise and seemed not to align with the rest of the game in a way that made sense to me.

A little heavy on the jargon, a little wordy, a bit of dodgy over-acted VA here and there, and a little slow at times, but an incredible setting and one of the few RPGs that i've played recently which really let you go in any direction you like. \n\nThe actual \"game-play\" is very simplistic and not much to write home about - but that's largely because that's not what the game is aiming for. This is closer to a visual novel than anything else, so don't expect any combat, platforming, or whatever else. That said, there is a fantastic and novel skill system in which various attributes of your physiology are personified and speak/contribute during conversations and interactions as you rank them up. There is a huge amount of replay value coming from that. Walking around movement can be a little cumbersome at times (I recommend click to walk, not WASD!) but it's not a huge issue.\n\nI would describe this game as the \"Who Murdered Councillor Jake?\" phase of Divinity:Original Sin expanded into a full game (for those who have played that.)\n\nWhat more can I say without spoiling the thing? It's an incredibly rich, sad experience. If you like a bit of melancholy, if you like to think about society and the systems around us, if you like murder mysteries and you like to get lost in fantasy settings that hold a mirror to our own world - this is a must play. There is a great mix here of personal tragedy to indulge in, supported by a genuinely captivating and deeply realised setting/mythology as the backdrop. I'm astounded by it. As soon as I beat the game and started reading about it online (no longer scared of spoilers) I realised just how deep the rabbit hole goes, how many amazing interactions and branches truly existed.\n\nThe game broke my heart.

The player's role is to explore the map, meet the NPCs and Experience it. Look at this moral dilemma, Commander Shepherd! Ooh, come chat to this entertaining robot. It thinks it's a person! Haha, if you take this skill, you can talk to this here dog! \n\nIf you talk to most people about their favourite computer RPGs, they'll probably tell you about their favourite NPCs. I loved HK-47 in KotOR. I thought Morte in Planescape was fantastic. But. I don't remember Anything about the characters I played. This character maxed persuasion, I think. This other character learned to cast a spell that summoned meteors.\n\nYou never get to Be the memorable NPC. You only ever get to meet them.\n\nIn Disco Elysium, you get to be the memorable NPC. You get to be the loud, or morose, or delusional, or obsessive character that you want to play. The skill system is not, contrary to most other RPGs, full of outward-facing things like 'MORE CRITICAL HITS' or 'BE SNEAKIER'. It's inward-looking. There's a skill called INLAND EMPIRE that just means you imagine inanimate objects talking to you. There's a skill that makes you better at conceptualisation.  The 'rhetoric' skill is tied to your character's propensity to lie. In Disco Elysium, your PC's psyche is the point. \n\nDisco Elysium understands why I play tabletop roleplaying, because I want to explore being interesting characters.\n\nIf you want to min-max your stats and find ways to optimise a combat build, don't pick up this game.\n\nIf you want to play a straight-arrow boring cop who solves murders with an occasional gun-fight, I don't know if this is the game for you.\n\nI have threatened to arrest a man I owed money to, then harangued him about his love life. I confabulated wildly to a kooky old lady and told her I was some kind of PSYCHIC GHOST BUSTER. I keep telling people we need to EAT THE RICH. I've internalised a thought that I might be some kind of rock star SUPER COP (i am not). I gave myself a quest to sing karaoke. I sucker-punched a child. I lie constantly  to cover up my insecurities and my sardonic partner catches me out, like a child. I think I'm supposed to solve a murder?\n\nI am hobocop. I am a delusional communist. I cry at case files. I have lost my gun. I insist places are haunted (they are not). I am a hot mess. \n\nI am my own memorable NPC.\n\nI barely care if I ever solve this crime, I am having so much fun.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI finished it I stand by everything I ever said\n\n10/10 GOTY \n\nLt Kim Kitsuragi best boi 2019", "timestamp_created": 1571841554, "timestamp_updated": 1573640045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 581, "votes_funny": 47, "weighted_vote_score": "0.954156875610351563", "comment_count": 26, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73957623": {"recommendationid": "73957623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079531453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1652243830}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're the type of person to crank your speech up to 100 right away on Fallout, this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1596866212, "timestamp_updated": 1596866212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 479, "votes_funny": 81, "weighted_vote_score": "0.954151034355163574", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56668642": {"recommendationid": "56668642", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990448462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 244, "playtime_forever": 4401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1433, "last_played": 1656647828}, "language": "english", "review": "A common thread among critics has been that Disco Elysium is the kind of game we're going to talk about as the turning point of an epoch -- that it's so influential we're going to talk about what games were before Disco Elysium and how they're different after it. \n\nAnd that's really how it ought to be, but I'm skeptical that we'll see it happen, because the thing that makes Disco Elysium so special isn't some easy-to-reproduce aspect in its systems; it's the writing. And writing a game as brilliant as this has always been an option, albeit one few games are going to live up to. The systems are neat, the clownish dressup minigame to solve puzzles is something one could duplicate, etc., but Disco Elysium lives and dies by its writing, and that's not something everyone can just easily copy to create a new milieu of adventure RPGs.\n\nIt's wickedly funny and achingly sad in equal measure, a combination that probably won't lend itself to your average dragon-killing story or similar to come down the line. It's a game that wears politics -- not necessarily your politics or someone else's, but politics in general -- on its sleeve and is extremely sympathetic to people while viciously criticizing any given sector of belief. Disco Elysium is, for example, far too familiar with the communist worldview not to have the sympathies of its writers, but is also the most vicious and valid criticism of communist ideology I've ever seen. It's equally merciless to any of its would-be competitors.  It's a game that's tender and sympathetic to its characters and positively ruthless to everything they believe in.\n\nAll of this is to say that Disco Elysium is the kind of achievement that deserves to be spoken of as a turning point in adventure/RPG games, but it didn't get there through some novelty of system.

I purchased the Enhanced Edition of PST a while ago and played through it again, it was for the most part as wonderful as I remember it being.\n\nThere was a game released a year or two ago called Torment: Tides of Numenera. It was billed as a spiritual sequel to PST, and I found the setting and the characters to be lacking. Distant. Alien for the sake of being alien. The writing was more flowery than it needed to be - it pulled punches when it should have gone for the knock out. I didn't find it to be a complete wash and I played through about 70 percent of it, which is quite good for me because as I've mentioned I don't make very much room in my life for media consumption.\n\nI've only played Disco Elysium for a few nights and I can say that this is *it*.

This game is on par with some of the best games I\u2019ve played, and also, some of the best books I've read. The game is currently hailed as the spiritual successor to the cult classic, Planescape: Torment, and for good reason, but I would go as far as to say Disco is superior. People tend to compare games like Disco and Planescape to books, and I agree, but Disco embraces it\u2019s own literature much more than its precursor, and diverges in a big way from most RPGs, in deciding to cut the fat by omitting the presence of traditional RPG combat. This is an ambitious idea for a cRPG, and it might be a turn off for some players, but I think it pays off well, because the result of this decision is a breath of fresh air. It stands out as a completely unique and refreshing experience in a genre where the player mowing down thousands of their enemies and proceeding to take their loot is the norm (nothing wrong with those games). That\u2019s not to say the game is devoid of confrontation or violence, because there is plenty of that, it\u2019s just done through text and skill checks, and it\u2019s done really well. If you\u2019ve ever read a book and you get to an intense, heart-pounding moment, and you\u2019re reading as fast as you can, frantically flipping the pages to reach the outcome of a high-stakes situation, you will understand that the lack of traditional \u201ccombat\u201d in Disco doesn\u2019t mean the game is a sit back and relax experience, the game is full of tension, and at many points the story will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, hoping that you pass your next skill check, scared, excited, happy or sad, angry or satisfied, but ultimately, engaged.\n\nThe effort that was put into the worldbuilding and authenticity of each individual character, but also the authenticity of the player character and his partner, Kim, is where the game is the strongest, and it leads to a sense of immersion I have never felt in a text driven game. Each character is incredibly unique and they all have their own perspective on the world around them. This is the best way to learn about the world of Disco, by listening to the varying opinions of the citizens of Revachol, and it mirrors real life in many ways, because most of the opinions we form are based on people, the opinions they hold, and the things they say, do, or write. You are rarely being hand fed information about the world, to learn about it requires you to ask questions. Every character you meet lies on a broad political spectrum, from far-left, far-right, to the moderate, middling, fence-sitter. What makes this even better is that you can mold your player character to lie anywhere on this spectrum as well. This is an example of choice that most modern RPGs lack, and the result gives complexity to the player character. The player\u2019s skills are also more than meets the eye, and I would also go as far as to categorize the player\u2019s skills as characters. Your skills will constantly talk to you, building lore, arguing with each other, and breaking down complex ideas. This makes it easier to determine who you want your character to be, and however wild the dialogue option might be, it will rarely feel out of place, due to the wild storm of thoughts that rages on inside the mind of the player character. In this way, Disco is different from other RPGs, not with the ludicrous and radical things you have the choice to say, but to [i] think. [/i] I\u2019ve seen plenty of crazy dialogue options, but never before have I seen in an RPG a first person perspective into the mind of the player character, while also allowing the freedom to choose what your character thinks. It\u2019s an ambitious step that results in even more depth when it comes to building your character. \n\nFor a genre that has its roots in fantasy, Disco is extremely loyal to what makes an RPG an RPG, without submitting to the fantasy genre the way most RPG\u2019s do. I love fantasy, but I think Disco\u2019s world is so refreshing because of how similar it is to our world. Revachol has an incredibly rich and depressing history, and the people that live there are downtrodden and economically stunted, and it isn\u2019t because a dragon burned their crops and ate their livestock, it's due to a long chain of historical events, paired with the fact that the people in charge of the city want it that way. RPGs rarely tend to hit this close to home, and that's what makes the game so refreshing. Sure, the game can be fantastical at times, but nothing far from the realm of reason. Most of the time, the game chooses to portray a gritty reality, with real life roots, historical and modern, and the game is better off for it.\n\nThe story puts you in the shoes of an amnesiac detective, with little knowledge of the world or his past. His story is profoundly interesting and heartbreaking, it will make you contemplate decisions you\u2019ve made in real life, but at the same time, manages to be incredibly funny, uplifting and motivational. The main character\u2019s story, the story of the case, and the story of Revachol are all intertwined into an impressive triple narrative. The case will leave you with your head spinning, it\u2019s very unpredictable, and you will constantly be throwing your predictions out the window. The scale of the case, the twists, turns, and lies, is masterfully done, and attempting to solve it with your crime-bro Kim is one of the most gratifying experiences in gaming. Each side quest is amazing, and crafted with care, so I would recommend doing every single one.\n\nThe relationship between the player character and his partner is one of the most compelling relationships in any piece of entertainment that I\u2019ve consumed. It rivals, and even exceeds some of the relationships between the player character and companions in BioWare\u2019s old games (the good ones), which are considered to be the gold standard for companions. The game also gives you the choice of turning your relationship with Kim into a trainwreck, and it\u2019s choices like those that define Disco, in a genre where player choice is being strangled to death by the current trend of RPGs. Don\u2019t expect 100 different endings though, Disco aims to tell a story, and it delivers, it\u2019s mainly the experiences you undergo throughout the journey where choice is the strongest. \n\nThe game is quite heavy on the reading side, but if you are intimidated by it you should understand that the way the text is fed to you is incredibly accommodating, and that\u2019s due to the way your skills summarize complex ideas. Digesting a complex political, historical, economic, or philosophical concept is made easy by your skills, they will break down everything to the point where I believe anyone can play this game and enjoy it, you don\u2019t need to be a part of a book club or own a library card to understand the concepts the game throws at you.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal. The melodies you will hear range from melancholic and sorrowful that will immerse you in the world and story, to hardcore bass fueled \u201cnightclub\u201d music that will help you understand the taste in music some characters have, to showdown music pulled straight from a western.\n\nAll of these amazing aspects culminate in the best detective-fiction I have ever experienced, some of the best worldbuilding and characters I have ever witnessed, and one of my most memorable adventures in gaming. I think there are too many things this game does well for someone not to enjoy it, and the experience is also very streamlined for a cRPG. I previously said that it\u2019s one of the best RPG\u2019s of all time, but I honestly think the game transcends not only the RPG genre as a whole, but video games as well.

Pure, unadulterated delight. It's like the game is winking at me, every time a dialogue option veers into completely unexpected places, or a joke surprises me into laughing out loud, or an astonishingly witty line brings a grin of appreciation to my face that just never leaves. Even the depressing parts that squeeze your heart are breathtakingly real. How can you not fall in love with someone that makes you laugh and feel emotions so easily? The game and I are in this together. We've bonded. It's too late to go back now.\n\nIn case you live under a rock and don't know about literally the best god damn game to come out in 2019, let me introduce you: Disco Elysium is a story-driven cRPG where you progress not by fighting battles but by navigating excellently written conversations. In this regard I'd say the game more resembles an adventure game: you explore the world, pick up items, talk to people, talk to them again after things have changed, and you try to overcome obstacles by using out-of-the-box thinking. The rpg elements come into play with the unique set of skills (and I'm not joking when I say unique) you can invest in, the dice rolls (completely transparent and 100% based on luck) that can come up during dialogue, and of course the bread-and-butter of all good rpg games worth their salt: about a million quests and sidequests that give you that sweet sweet exp and a sense of completion as you methodically scratch them off the list.\n\nThe plot of the game is about an amnesiac detective trying to solve a murder case and that's all I'm going to say on this matter. No, I'm serious. I don't want to spoil [i]anything[/i] for you, not a single first impression. In fact I've already said too much. Frankly I wish I could borrow a leaf out of our protagonist's notebook and erase all memory of this game from my brain, just so I could experience that bewildered sense of wonderment I felt when I first realised how truly weird and unique this journey I was embarking on was. Suffice it to say, this is a very very [i]very VERY[/i] well-written game. This isn't hyperbole. You're in good hands.\n\nMy only word of advice to new players is to forget everything you know about playing rpgs. Don' try to optimise your build or savescum and reload every time something doesn't go perfectly according to plan. In fact Disco Elysium encourages a truly transgressive philosophy for a videogame: [b]failure is an option[/b]. Failed rolls can still progress the game, they offer unique dialogue branches, hell sometimes failure is actually preferable! So don't try to \"win\" the game. Play the game. Experience it. Be free.\n\nAlso if you ever get tired of reading, take a break and come back later. There is a LOT of reading involved (I mean, obviously, kinda that's the whole point of the game) and it would be a pity to speed through it because of burnout. Because content-wise Disco Elysium feels massive. It's not, not truly, the world map is hardly that big compared to other games, and yet it [i]feels[/i] big. This is because there are about a million things to do and interact with and talk to in every square inch available. I've spent literally hours in one single area of the map. There's also an \"open world\" element in play since you can travel to (almost) everywhere in whatever sequence you like. It's like the opposite of a ubisoft game: instead of a huge empty map filled with generic identical encounters, you have a medium sized map filled with entirely unique encounters to explore. I know which kind I prefer to play.\n\nAnd improving on the amount of content is the surprising replayabilty of Disco Elysium. You wouldn't think a plot driven game where there is one single mystery with one single answer would be as engaging the second time, and yet! This mostly comes from how much your skills affect the dialogue and narration, giving you different lines and encounters you didn't even know you were missing. My first playthrough was a high Intellect, high Psyche one (which was an absolute blast even though I was such a weakling my tie literally killed me in the first five minutes, I very much recommend it) so for my second playthrough I went for the opposite skills and was surprised by how fun and new it all felt. Plus let's be real, there's no way you're gonna find everything on your first go. There's always a dice roll to fail in new and exciting ways!\n\nI've extolled the game's virtues long enough so let me just reiterate the main point: Disco Elysium is not only a great and well-written game, it's also a [i]unique[/i] one. It's the best thing I've experienced in years, and I sincerely hope it starts a new trend for clever, witty, passionately made games.

You play as a fuck-up, and, naturally, you start fucking things up from your very first minute into the game. Actually, scratch that: you've begun fucking up *before* the game even started: you wake up in a trashed hotel room, with a massive hangover and absolutely no idea how you got there. Or who you are. Or what you do. Or even the most basic concepts of reality, like *money*, or *time*. Yeah, it's not looking pretty for you.\n\nIt doesn't take very long for you to remember (or, rather, relearn) that you are a police detective, and that you're working in a murder investigation. You are a drug addict and a drunk, but it turns out you're also a pretty good detective. Your partner, Lieutenant Kim Katsuragi, shows up and you two start detecting right away. \n\nAs if having severe retrograde amnesia isn't enough, there's *one more* unusual thing going on with you: you hear voices in your head. All the time. Each skill in this game (like 'Empathy' or 'Perception' or 'Logic') is personified by a voice in your brain, and they talk to you. They can tell you when someone is lying, or what's the model of a particular car, or if something is moving outside your field of vision. Sometimes they openly contradict each other ('Electrochemistry' tells you to drink that bottle of wine in your hand, while 'Volition' urges you not to), which is often pretty hilarious. Throughout the game, you also use these skills in various skill checks. Most of them can be retried if you fail, but some are permanent. And if you fail a skill check... well, you have to deal with the consequences. If you try to convince someone and fail, you say something truly embarrassing. If you try to kick open a door and fail, you hurt yourself. As I said, this is a game about fucking up, and sometimes failing a skill check is infinitely more interesting than passing it.\n\nThe amnesiac protagonist is a pretty tired trope, but this game plays it so hilariously that it works. It's a great way to introduce you to the world of Disco Elysium, and my god there's a *lot* to get introduced to. What the fuck is the RCM? Or the Union? Or the Coalition? You're likely to feel as confused as your protagonist in your first few hours into the game, but trust me, it goes away. With enough time you'll be living and breathing in Martinaise, traipsing around its alleys like a natural, looking for clues. This is in no small part thanks to how well the game is written. Seriously, I could gush on and on about the writing. It's funny, weird, poetic, and heartbreaking, but above all, so *unique*, so incredibly original, it looks more like the voice of a single, experienced novelist rather than a team of writers. \n\nBe warned, though: this game is a slow burner. It feels more like reading a novel than anything else I've played in recent memory, which is great! But it can also bore you to tears. Don't be surprised if you don't get hooked immediately. When I first started, I would play it for an hour or two, drop it for like three days, pick it up for another couple of hours, rinse and repeat. I felt like I just couldn't get into it... until I did. Like in any good detective story, the more you learn about the case you're solving, the more you realize the stakes are higher than what they seemed at first. I can't stop thinking about the last few hours of Disco Elysium. It's not even just the ending: the whole last *third* or so of the game is a wild ride. Try your best to avoid spoilers!\n\nIf you ever felt like a fuck-up, this game will likely resonate a lot with you. Maybe the specifics are different; maybe, for you, instead of drugs and alcohol, it's eating too much, or spending too much time on social media. Or maybe it *is* drugs and alcohol, in which case the game will probably cut too close to the bone for you. Maybe your fuck-ups aren't as colossal. It doesn't matter: they all share the same self-loathing, self-pitying core, and Disco Elysium speaks to that. But it's not all doom and gloom. To be fair, more than about fucking-up, Disco Elysium is a game about what happens after. It's a game about pulling your shit so tightly-packed together it deforms space-time. Disco Elysium is about picking up the pieces and moving on, even if (especially if) you don't know how to.", "timestamp_created": 1616011964, "timestamp_updated": 1617299365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 412, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923917114734649658", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63379003": {"recommendationid": "63379003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018483984", "num_games_owned": 1966, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 2183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2183, "last_played": 1579096376}, "language": "english", "review": "Point and click adventure games feature fairly low down my genre list, so I didn't even look at Disco Elysium until it started appearing on so many game of the year lists. Then it started appearing on game of the decade lists and I paid attention, sighed and threw down my wallet. What's the big deal I thought. Is it is a gimmick? How does such a niche genre garner the title of masterpiece. What's the trick?\n\nDisco Elysium IS a masterpiece, there's no doubt about it in my mind, having completed the game in approximately 35 hours across 5 days. I'm not going to write a thousand words on this one (which is a change for me), because I think it's hard to capture what the game is about even with ten thousand. I don't have the wit or writing skills of the creators of this game, I can't conjure up something clever to convince you, and I'm far behind thousands of other reviewers who have already told you what I'm telling you. You'll just have to trust me. Play the game.\n\nDisco Elysium is without a doubt, the best written game I've ever read. It is also the most in depth, with believably broken characters. Not the caricature of the noire detective, but a genuine man so broken I can see him stand before me and feel his pain. It's not just the main character though, it is every single character I encountered and that's what makes this game really shine - how complete it is. It is every setting, it is every thought, it is every action. The gameplay itself is standard point and click; you click things, you read about things, you talk to people, you read more about things, you equip things which increase your stats to complete tasks (which naturally, you read about) and you move the forward story. It sounds mundane when the gameplay is broken down, but the world is crafted so perfectly that you simply cannot fail to be immersed and invested.\n\nI completed Disco Elysium about 6 weeks ago. I've been thinking what to say about it ever since and failing to find the words I need. It's indescribable.\n\n\ud83d\udc96 If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url]. \ud83d\udc96", "timestamp_created": 1581500228, "timestamp_updated": 1581500269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.922851145267486572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99426394": {"recommendationid": "99426394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035884174", "num_games_owned": 762, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 5224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5224, "last_played": 1631459003}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][i]We all have our different mediums.[/i][/h1]\n \nDisco Elysium doesn\u2019t really feel like a game made by developers, but rather as a game made by writers who decided to tell a story through a video game. As such, it is a game that innovates quite a bit, even if it isn't particularly well-made from a technical standpoint.\n\nGenerally, detective games tend to be too linear, not leaving enough room for you to piece things together yourself. Disco Elysium does more than enough to scratch that particular itch.\n \nYou take on the role of a detective with a vast array of skills, 24 to be exact, separated into four categories the game calls Attributes: Intellect, Psyche, Physique and Motorics. As the game has no combat system, these skills will most notably come into play when encountering skill checks, either during conversations or when interacting with objects in the environment. For example, the Physical Instrument (Physique) skill will come into play should you need to break down a door or a window, while Empathy (Psyche) will be taken into account when trying to emotionally connect with a character you\u2019re talking to. These checks are separated into White checks and Red checks. Red checks can only be attempted once, while White checks can be retried by leveling up the relevant skill... Or by doing some detective work on your own. Other than that, your skills are influenced by the clothes you\u2019re wearing, time limited buffs that come from consumables, and Thoughts - perks that can have varying uses and are unlocked by specific actions you perform.\n\nThe aforementioned detective work comes into play when dealing with hidden modifiers most, if not all, of the active checks in the game have. These will impact your rolls either positively or negatively, provided you\u2019ve fulfilled certain requirements. For example, let\u2019s say you have a suspect you need to persuade into working with you, with a White check of your Authority skill standing in your way. However, earlier in the conversation you\u2019ve said something that made the character take you less seriously, thus earning yourself a negative modifier on the roll and failing the check because of it. If you\u2019re out of available skill points, the check will remain locked, and you'll need to head out in search of more XP so you can try again. However, before managing to level up, you engage in conversation with someone who knows your suspect and acquire some incriminating information you can confront them with. You do so and receive a positive modifier on your Authority check, which unlocks it and helps you pass. Thoughts can affect checks in similar ways. You have a huge amount of freedom in almost every interaction you\u2019ll come across in Disco Elysium, leading to impressively dynamic storytelling opportunities. It is a game that benefits from multiple playthroughs, as not every character will be able to pass every single check once the more difficult ones start rolling in later in the game. However, the true beauty of it comes from how your Attributes and skills affect conversations outside of checks, and in turn develop your character's personality.\n\nDuring every conversation, the game will constantly be performing passive skill checks in the background that determine whether or not your skills will [i]talk[/i] to you. I mean that quite literally, as skills will chime in during conversation to advise you on how you should act, what to say, as well as provide information on your conversation partner. Not only can the same conversation have a different outcome based on your skills, but your perception of it can completely change as well. You can even argue with them on the validity of their advice. Sometimes, more of them will want to advise you on the same issue, getting into fights with each other. They all have their own personality, so think of it as carrying 24 additional characters wherever you go.\n\nDisco Elysium\u2019s writing is definitely the best I\u2019ve seen across all of the games I\u2019ve played, even the handful of those I\u2019d say I like more. No word is wasted and anything can come back into play later on. Even all the background information on the game's expansive world doesn\u2019t feel out of place and can affect future conversations should you bother to read, or listen through all of it, as the entire game is voiced. Hell, even simple flavor text doesn\u2019t feel the least bit tacked on, as It helps in establishing the numerous characters you\u2019ll come across - to the point where I doubt there\u2019ll be a single NPC you don\u2019t have a thought-out opinion on. The way the text box takes up the right side of the screen, while the left side is dedicated to letting you admire the beautiful, painterly visuals of the scene you\u2019re currently in, allows you to read and navigate these prolonged conversations with ease. I could go on about how good the writing is, but I also wish to talk about the negatives, as well as something else that beating the game had made me think about.\n\nDisco Elysium has its faults. While I don\u2019t mind the lack of combat, having the entirety of the gameplay rely on dialogue and skill checks makes it drag a bit in the second half. The animations could use some work \u2013 some of them are unbelievably stiff \u2013 and the pathfinding for a game in which a good amount of time is spent walking from place to place is frustrating. The performance is fine, but I\u2019ve encountered a good number of graphical glitches; sudden changes in lighting, flickering icons and certain text and images appearing where they\u2019re not supposed to. Sometimes, the game would soft lock and prevent me from interacting with anything until I reload a save or tab in and out. Music would fail to play at times, leaving key scenes completely silent, save for the dialogue. It's a shame, since every track has the ability to further solidify this game as the Iconic Moment Generator it already is once it plays properly. The voice acting I found to be hit-or-miss, with most of its strength coming from the writing rather than the performances. It also notably varies in recording quality. Some of it is also  missing, or is straight up mismatched with the text on screen.\n\nSo, what happens to the verdict then?\n\nWe\u2019re all guilty of calling a game a \u201cwork of art\u201d at some point or another, as a way to emphasize that we\u2019re not just talking about one that\u2019s damn good, but also surpasses what it means to be a video game and gets elevated to this mystical status where it gets to hang out with all the big boys of the art world, such as books, paintings, sculptures or other things you might find when you go visit a museum or a gallery. Wouldn\u2019t it be strange if we applied this standard, that only specific titles within a medium are considered art, to other forms of expression? Say we compare two paintings, where one is a depiction of an important historic event, and the other merely a beautiful portrait? An abstract art piece to some really good fanart you saw online? Is a fun 250 pages long sci-fi novel a lesser work than a 1000 pages long monolith, full to the brim with existential dread, written by some Russian dude in the 19th century? Would you rate any of these on a scale from one to ten? Probably not, as it is kind of redundant to label pieces that have had so much impact on the world with a score. It all boils down to video games not being around for long enough and being primarily viewed as an entertainment medium rather than an artistic one.\n\nDisco Elysium\u2019s faults aren\u2019t that severe, but If I give it an 8.5 because of them, does that mean I consider it a lesser experience than a game which, while not as ambitious, is an excellent RTS with great gameplay, no technical issues and okay writing, I gave a 9 to? \n\nIt\u2019s all a bit melodramatic, I agree. But, how would you feel assigning a number to a famous painting, which would make me come across as too pretentious had I name-dropped it here?", "timestamp_created": 1631764202, "timestamp_updated": 1643462913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 372, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.921938776969909668", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72788620": {"recommendationid": "72788620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391638600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 203879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1608045698}, "language": "english", "review": "Disco Elysium is one of the best games I've ever played.

But I'm going to tell my story anyway. It relates to my very low play time of just forty hours at time of writing.\n\nI picked this game up at the start of an incredibly ugly and acrimonious divorce from someone who had (I felt at the time, and still feel, just over two years later) treated me incredibly badly. My mother, my only relative, was (and sadly, remains to this day) profoundly unwell. I was suddenly very, very alone, and understood none of the reasons why. I was in a very bad, very dangerous place mentally, and that is something I am still working on. I was a mess, and still have some of the concomitant problems of that mess - I am still suffering from insomnia, and I still have very low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. So, guy having a bad time picks this game up, right?\n\nPlaying it was... ethereal. The story is well written, and the little foibles the game has (your skills all have personalities, and you can 'mull things over' in a memory cabinet to change how you, and they, operate in the world) are incredibly innovative. The artwork is both grotesque and beautiful - in fact, I think the soundscape and visuals of this game might well be the most aesthetically pleasing I have ever encountered in a game - and the characters are well rounded and have understandable motivations. You may not agree with them, but you can see how they got there. But the story... oh, the story. It's a heartbreaking story of endless optimism, and speaks to you of letting go, and how things will be OK because you're still here, it's OK, you just need to stand up... Something beautiful is going to happen...\n\nin short, I think this was the right game, at the right time, with the right story for me. That's why I only have forty hours. The game was so existentially wonderful as an experience, I feel that treating it as 'just some game I have' and playing it to death (and the replay value is there, believe me - I will go back one day) feels like it would undo what the game did for me, or at least, it would cheapen it. It would not exactly be an overstatement to say: This game might have saved my life.\n\nSo, yeah. A solid 10. Easy. No contest. My favourite experience, let alone favourite game.

I'm still not sure if this postcard is rubbish or some distinct clue to a yet unknown mystery. \n\nWhat I have had in those first five hours is a surreal, existential nightmare splayed directly before me in all it's twisted glory, where conversations are not only held with the inhabitants of this watercolor dystopia, but with my inner self. Indeed, your subconscious plays as big a role, if not a bigger role, than most of the characters you meet - who each in turn are as colorful and as broken as the world they inhabit. \n\nThis is a big, cerebral game, without really trying to be. It's as much a detective game as it is an RPG, as much a point and click as a visual novel, as much an acid trip as a self help book. It's wholly and entirely unique, I can't say I've played anything quite like it. It wears it's hipster badge close to the vest, and is not afraid to be depressingly dark, oddly humorous, drunkenly philosophical, or even grotesquely macho. The sheer amount of freedom in how to tackle situations, the endless and sensible skill checks, the wildly realized universe, it's all so god damn impressive. \n\nI feel this game may offend some, and will most likely be an absolute bore to others, but if you are not averse to heaps of text, and heady, drug-addled introspection, and want to dive into a hardboiled, hardcore world, you will find yourself very welcome in Revachol.

It's good writing by modern novel standards, which makes it great writing by genre standards and outright unbelievably great by videogame standards.

There is no other game like it. It takes you to places you've never been to before and lets you go through unusual experiences. It puts you in the shoes of a detective tasked with solving a murder. An unstable, addicted, loser detective. Or a rather sane, boring detective. It's up to you. The game gives you the freedom to take your character in whatever direction you want and for the endgame it doesn't really matter. It's an RPG, but don't worry about stats, or which path to take. There is no right or most effective way to play Disco Elysium. You play this game to experience the story and the strange moments. In that way, it's not unlike the adventure games of old like the ones made by Sierra or LucasArts. You'll spend most of the game talking to people and exploring... and that's really about it. Combat is not a significant part of the game at all. Chatting with a stranger and passing a few checks can get you very far. Leave your guns or spells at home.\n\nYou've probably read that Disco Elysium involves a lot of reading. It's true. Reading and choosing dialogue is 90% of what you'll do. That and running around, sometimes aimlessly. Now, if that makes you lose your interest rather quickly, then this game is not for you. Indeed, it's not fast-paced and that's not a bad thing if you're looking for something a little different. It's not 'Slow Boil: The Game', because that award goes to Else Heart.Break(), but it gets close sometimes.\n\nAnd that's where my biggest criticism lies. The pace is [i]too[/i] slow sometimes. I'm under the impression that the developers have relied on the game's writing (which is terrific and amazing!) a bit too much. It's an RPG, why not let players explore new areas a bit more? Or at least a bit sooner? New areas open up very slowly and are gated behind major story advancements. Expect to travel between A and B [i]a lot[/i] before C and D even appear on the horizon. The same applies to the dialogue. You'll spend a lot of time talking to the same characters over and over again before someone new gets introduced. I'm fine with reading a lot, but especially during the middle part of the story I really wanted the game to pick up the unnecessarily slow pace. A few times I had to load an older save because the devs clearly expected me to do X, and I didn't do X, and that resulted in me following a dead end. An example would be (and this is not really a spoiler) me not being able to sleep anywhere and thus not advancing the story because I chose not to accept a certain character's money offer, and thus I couldn't afford the hotel room. Yes, you can spend a lot of time collecting tar and searching every nook and cranny for a few pennies here and there, but come on... you are the Hobo Cop. Look at the way the developers present their protagonist. Surely he should be able to sleep on a bench at night! So just so you know in advance, when that someone offers you money, just accept it. You'll save yourself a lot of trouble.\n\nThere are a few other ways the game gets artificially lengthened. I wish it was possible to save anywhere, including during the game's many dialogue scenes. If you have to leave and stop playing while talking to a character, next time you play you'll be reverted to the most recent save [i]before[/i] that talk, which can be annoying because you have to go through the lengthy dialogue again. Of course this time you won't have to finish the voice acting and read everything again, but still. Let the player save anywhere. Another strange thing that happened to me a lot was 95%+ checks failing quite regularly. That can happen, but it happened suspiciously often. Perhaps there's something going on under the hood that's hidden from the player, or maybe I'm imagining things. Either way, it made me want to reload a save a few times to redo a check.\n\nMost 'professional' game 'journalists' never mention these things in their 'reviews'. Instead they go on and on about their GOTY nominations, always gushing over this year's dearest game in 15+ articles spanning several weeks, but rarely covering the glaringly obvious negative aspects. That's great publicity for the developer, but not very useful for gamers who want to buy a nice game with their hard-earned money. That's why I felt compelled to go against the grain a bit and deliver a slightly different message.\n\nDisco Elysium still is an amazing game. The writing is superb and on another level. The art is unique and atmospheric. The characters are great. The city is great. Revachol breathes character, just like Thief's \"the City\". If you're looking for a game that almost plays like you're reading a book, a game to relax with, a world that sucks you in, then you should definitely buy this game. It may not line up with your expectations entirely, but you'll have a good time and it's a great experience. During the game's later stages the pace will pick up a bit and the ending doesn't disappoint.\n\nHere's to many more succesful titles from ZA/UM!", "timestamp_created": 1640549852, "timestamp_updated": 1640549852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 171, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911004006862640381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55706882": {"recommendationid": "55706882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010217378", "num_games_owned": 895, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 3084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2206, "last_played": 1612233383}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's start with the simple. [i]Disco Elysium[/i] is my GOTY, GO5Y (game of the recent five years), and the spiritual successor to [i]Planescape Torment[/i] I've been waiting for for twenty years. It's THAT good, unapologetically. If you can even conceive of touching a game of this genre, buy it.\n\nThis is an isometric RPG without fighting (so closee to an adventure, really), with a very heavy emphasis on the plot, so if you're strictly opposed to doing much reading, it won't be your cup of tea. However, if you're only [i]mildly[/i] opposed to reading in games, I'd still suggest you give it a try. The writing is very good: succinct, dynamic, engaging, with no purple prose and irrelevant walls of lore. It begins as a sort of [i]Planescape Torment[/i] parody with the main character getting amnesia from drinking, yet at the same time the weird and existential aspects of the story also shine immediately. In other words, the beginning is very strong; try the game, and in the first hour you'll see for yourself if it grabs you or not.\n\nThe presentation is beautiful, the game's style both gentle and a bit creepy. The UI is slick, the music sad and unintrusive. It's all nice\u2014and not the reason we're here.\n\nThe reason is the story. \n\nAs a narrative designer myself, I can't for the love of me imagine how they've done it. \n\nGood writing demands empathy\u2014getting in the shoes of every character you create, even when they're not nice people. Good reactive video game narratives demand logic and structural thinking\u2014creating a text that is in a flux, knowing that the player will only see parts of it depending on their skills and choices and making sure each variant is good and interesting. The absolute majority of games, even story-based, only deliver one aspect: you either get a deep, memorable, but linear story (SOMA, The Last of Us) or a very reactive story made flexible by the fact that everyone is relatively shallow, so while you can influence a lot of things, you don't care deeply about any (Divinity: Original Sin 2). Even the story of [i]Planescape: Torment[/i] was kinda modular\u2014a lot of smaller characters and stories were only there to be there and add flavor to the world.\n\nAnd then you have [i]Disco Elysium[/i]. While its main story has certain fixed beats, you can approach every situation\u2014[i]every[/i] situation, I repeat\u2014in a number of very different ways, depending on what skills you choose. At the early stages it can almost feel like playing different games. You can make big choices.\n\nMore importantly though, in my 36 hours of playing, I haven't encountered a single instance of \"video game stupidity\", like the game gating me from logical actions just because I've done some things out of expected order\u2014which I certainly have (I only got the body down from the tree on Day 3, for example). This is not because you can do [i]anything[/i] in this game, but rather because it excels at manipulating you to [i]want[/i] to do the things it allows. The lengths the developers went to to make sure [i]Disco Elysium[/i] plays smooth, like a real-life LARP, is insane. You might not even notice it\u2014the moments when small remarks, like \"as I already told you\" or \"didn't you mean something else when you asked X before?\", are injected into the NPCs' dialogue, making it [i]flow[/i]. These are small things, but they make conversations sould like actual long conversations instead of bunches of informations dispersed to you.\n\nAnd boy, what conversations those are. Funny, interesting, genuinely intellectual, absurd, touching... there's no filler dialogue in the game, no filler characters\u2014every single person serves a narrative purpose, everyone's story or situation comes into play in some way. The fates of people get intertwined, making you come back to them again and again, digging deeper and deeper, discovering new facets of their personalities. [i]Disco Elysium[/i] uses its arguably-realistic setting to set character hooks\u2014start off with relatable and easily recognizable real-life problems. We've all met weird people like cryptozoology enthusiasts, drunken artists, communist nutsos or esoteric-minded ladies, we recognize the types and thus get engrossed in their stories\u2014thus getting attached. Yet, even though the quests are intertwined, most are also strong stories on their own, with different moods and styles.\n\nDelivering the news to that woman was one of the hardest things I've ever done in video games, and I play [i]Dark Souls[/i] a lot.\n\nI can't remember the last time I've changed my opinion of video game characters several times over the course of a playthough. I can't remember the last time I had to pause the game and seriously consider what choice to make. I'm STILL not sure what to think if Klaasje.\n\nI can't remember the last time a game would allow me to play as Karl Marx (I mean Kras Mazov, but, y'know) reincarnated. Or imagine the nothingness where all that exists is the swallowing motion in a human throat. Or make a truly HARD-CORE beat by finding [spoiler]a 2-mm hole in reality.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's this mixture of tones and styles that makes [i]Disco Elysium[/i] [i]transcendent[/i].\n\n(full ending spoilers) [spoiler]...Which is why I was so baffled by who the killer turned out to be. You do *not* introduce the killer in the final act of a crime story. It's like the basic rule of writing whoddunits. And I just can't believe this game's writers, who showed incredible skill with everything else, made this blunder by mistake... yet I can't understand this choice. It makes sense in that it gives a narrative purpose to all the background history stories: in the end, we did have a reason to get to know who the communists were and why the Revolution happened, because that's what ended up motivating the killer. But... you spend 30 hours forging our emotional connections with a huge cast of characters, making us feel for all kinds of people, and then throw a completely new character at us, that we have no connection to, who has no associates in the town and in the end is just a damaged psycho?\n\nI don't understand this choice and would be happy if someone explained it to me.[/spoiler]\n\nStill, perfect games do not exist. The walking speed in [i]Disco Elysium[/i] is torturous and the pathfinding is often painful. It gets annoying to change your clothes each time before a skill check, and the game basically invites you to save-scum.\n\nThose downsides are bearable, compared to the sad and hilarious story of our detective, his partner Kim Kitsuragi, by-the-book yet not cheerless, and this odd backwards corner of the world with its odd backwards politics, drama, love, and insanity.\n\nAnd a talking necktie.\n\nGOTY.\n\nP.

Totally blown away. \n\nI do a lot of tabletop roleplaying and improv comedy and when our group is having the most fun, it's when we are playing our characters honestly, not trying to go for an easy joke or trying to power game, but being vulnerable even at our character's detriment. Our game master (bless his heart) encourages our vulnerability and truth and finds way to reward us for these self imposed obstacles. It's about failing, and hopefully failing upwards. \n\nDisco Elysium feels like the first game that I have played that truly embodies this spirit. The main character, your partner (who I would die for), the larger ensemble, the town you are in, and even the world the game is set in are all failing. The game is a rube goldberg  machine of failure. Within this game's labyrinth of failure and loss, there is beauty, redemption, and moments that made me laugh out loud to myself. I failed skilled checks and ended up ahead because of it, sometimes literally. You grow from your failures, you learn (or you don't!), and you do it in a way that ends up feeling unique to your play through. \n\nOn that note- when I've been a part of bad tabletop roleplaying sessions, for me, it's because our GM or table does things to take away my character's autonomy. This can happen with game masters or groups that want to stick close to the rails of maybe a players handbook, or some sort of pre set GM module. When you, as a player color outside the lines, you are \"crazy\" until you get back on the rails and return to the regular scheduled programming. In Disco Elysium, coloring outside the lines are just as valid a play style as any.  It has spoiled me on dialogue options and character customization. You don't create your protagonist from scratch, but you get to customize your character's brain and how and what they think, and I've found that this is what I've always wanted from a RPG video game but never knew to ask for.  Your dominant stats (which you control and are very varied, ranging from Hand Eye Coordination to Shivers, which is akin to an affinity for out of body visions) are personified and provide you council as you play the game, and you discover thoughts which you can then internalize (just like real life!) to unlock new dialogue options, bonuses and penalties. It's glorious. It really feels like the game sees you. \n\nI have no idea how I'm supposed to play another role playing game after this one.

The writing in Disco Elysium is outstanding, not just in RPG, but in all of games;\nthe story of the game is quite thrilling and does use plot twists accordingly to advance the story and reach it to its conclusion, while also subverting some of the tropes of police procedural series, it is pretty original for an RPG to play detective. The themes of starting over, working hard to see the end, not giving in to despair, reconciliation and above all, dealing with failure wind throughout the game which gives it a genuinely mature feel.\n \nDisco Elysium is a very, very political game, several times pointing to how the gears of politics not many are interested in shape the world and each nation and group's place within it. Instead of a good/bad moral stance, it is instead a political stance that are decided through conversations and although all worldviews are treated with intense scrutiny and criticism, are given nuance, so keep that in mind when you talk to someone.\n\nThe characters in this game are some of the best and most developed I've seen, with the two main characters, Mr. DuBois and Kim might as well being as iconic (and kind of reminiscent of) Holmes and Watson;\nand the game doesn't stop there, every character, major or minor, has something distinct, each having their own complexities and struggles, having to deal with their views on you and the world, and ways you can get them to open up about the case and reveal the depths they're hiding, in that you feel very immersed in the game's setting. The characters don't feel like props put to a game for the story to progress, they feel like actual people with their own things happening in their lives. The voice-acting as well is done with great effort and since The Final Cut makes the game fully-voiced, it prospers.\n\nThe worldbuilding is one of the best, hands down. Taking place in a large but rundown city of Revachol put under a strict international military occupation following an attempt at a revolution, giving a rather powerful backdrop to the happenings you encounter along the way, the lynching becoming a small piece of puzzle in a much wider set, the world being reminiscent of ZA/UM's Estonian origins and its post-Soviet socioeconomic landscape. The developers spared no effort at creating a colossally-detailed world, with its own vocabulary, history and progression, yet very similar to our own, giving it an alien but familiar look that creates a wonderful mix of feeling like you're there.\n \nIt helps with the very good handling of the exposition, DuBois suffering from amnesia serves himself as a surrogate for the audience introducing the concepts slowly through the dialogue or the thoughts in his head, one is quite motivated latching for more information about Elysium by searching every room or investing in Encyclopedia skill to hear what a \"radiocomputer\" is. At the least showing the potential in setting in an different world that doesn't need to be Sci-Fi or Fantasy.\n\nThe visuals here do show the priorities set, the in-game 3D models are pretty flat with primitive movements, but is more than made up with the beyond moving artwork by lead artist Alexander Rostov. \nThe game's art style is incredibly distinct in that it doesn't look like a painting done on a frame or tablet, but a mural on the walls of rusted buildings, the game's landscape has a very painted-on look to it like you're walking on an interactive panoramic masterpiece, meanwhile the portrait of characters feels like commissioned portraits worthy of ending up on the museum, each one having different motives to it and what they feel. \n  \nI told a lot about the design in the story, but what about the actual gameplay...\n\nThe gameplay of Disco Elysium is... not that good. While staying true to the pen-and-paper RPGs and to me, it doesn't really translate well into a computer game partly due to lack of real action on screen. I will say it is very unique, rather than levelling up your weapons and armour to attack more enemies, you level up your inner thoughts that serve as your party members that guide you to a satisfactory outcome when talking to people, with a sufficient level passing a check where you can hear its thoughts. \nFor example, Rhetoric helping you see what are they trying to say and helping you better convince them, or Inland Empire making you have conversations with things that can't talk; crafting an extensive and thrilling game of shoulder angels. The skill levels are also capped to encourage replay value. \nThe issue comes from how it's not really balanced, most of actions occur in INT field so focusing on other fields can lock you out of many quests.\nThen there are the checks, roll a dice and see if it advances the plot. While care is given to cases where the check is failed since the game is about accepting it,, you'd rather want the best outcome like in any other game and one could be pushed into save-and-loading over and over to get it, which kind of pushes down the enjoyability.\n\nThe good thing is that the checks can be curved by completing side-quests but not all; will say, even the side-quests are very engaging and can have twists of their own, even a minor one like finding and recovering a corpse on a boardwalk has its own share of gravitas. Problem came when it piled quests on me at the beginning and gave nothing to do with them until later, a thing that made me feel under pressure and got me to put the game off for a few months. \nEither way, it is a game without much action with combat mechanics not existing, making it more like an interactive Poirot novel than what you expect for a game. If you're familiar with pen-and-paper, you'll probably enjoy this game a lot more, most of my issues with the gameplay come more from my particular distaste in RPG anyway.  \n\nThe music, well, just by exiting the first building you're in, you start to get greeted by the game's distinguishable score. It goes in several places, whether the gloomy \"Instrument of Surrender\" or the Pop-y \"Whirling-In-Rags\" or the gratifying \"La Revacholiere\", it stays in your head. Just the soundtrack alone has its place in games history. Honestly, with a name like \"Disco Elysium\", I was expecting Disco music.\n\nConclusion:\n+:Deep and complex characters, amazing and emotional artwork, otherworldly worldbuilding, engaging story, great voice-acting, distinct and beautiful music.\n-: Gameplay is barren at best, frustrating at worst, slow and badly-paced beginning.\n\nDisco Elysium has its flaws, but they can be forgiven easily by the marvelous might of its storytelling and the art direction. The game may not be great to play, but it is extraordinary to look and hear, and with that ends up as the one game I can hold to prove computer games are an art form. While it had its humble beginnings, it truly ends up as one of the greatest indie games ever made, standing on the shoulders with Cave Story, Papers Please, Undertale, Cuphead and such.\n\n\nEdit: Tweaked some of the parts to make it structured better, and elaborated more on the gameplay aspects.

Incredible game.\n\nI'll preface this by saying it's not gonna be for everyone. If you don't like point and clicks you're probably not gonna like Disco and that's kind of just how it is. It's much more forgiving than other point and clicks, I must say, and it's emphasis on dialogue and dialogue trees may hook you much more than you anticipate if you're nervous on the genre, but it's a game predicated on heavy patience and if you're not looking for that you may not enjoy Disco.\n\nThis game is atmospheric. A lot of people kind of sneer at 'atmosphere' as being a surface level of things, and in certain cases I agree, but in Disco it's real meat. The game really does convey a sense of mystery, melancholy, otherworldliness, and sleaze. The characters, even the smallest NPCs, even each of the individual Skills, all carry a sense of real personality, many of them striking and memorable. The voice acting only drives it home, none of the accents feeling out of place, from the gloomy narrator's voice to the shrill librarian to the borderline-obnoxious yet lovable screaming of the necktie, *bratan!*\n\nThe game's plot is excellent, I find. It's twisty, sure, and I usually dislike that in a work as it discourages engaging with it again, but I found myself craving a replay the second the credits rolled, and still craving it hours later, as I write this review. I chalk it up to the sense of mystery in this game - no matter how thorough I was, there were still unanswered questions, loose ends, mysteries, and it was tantalizing enough to make you go back, try a different starting build, play the detective as a different person, see if it would change and uncover anything new. \n\nIf this game has a flaw it'd easily be that you can find yourself struggling with a lack of options to pass the time. Usually this encourages exploration into areas you haven't thought, but sometimes you just wish you could use that bench while Kim's around, yanno? I also found people complaining a lot about the skill checks, and how unfair they could be - I'm a fan of tabletop RPGs, and I found them welcome in a way, familiar even, and really it could be easily work-aroundable through quicksaves and reloading. People might feel they lose honor that way, but, come on, it's a single-player story game. Is anyone really gonna judge?\n\nOverall, I really loved Disco. It's a memorable game, one great for sharing with friends, and I really found it charming (under the detective's layers of grease) and I'll certainly be coming back for more. I found it scratching a certain itch I've had for ages, one that - funny enough - I first got acquainted with way back when I was first introduced to Wraith: The Oblivion, which I found this game strongly reminding me of, for whatever reason. Was it the identity issues? The voices? The temptation? The ruins of Revachol, and the live crawling inside it? Hard to say, but it scratched it for me. I don't really feel like putting an X/10 arbitrary metric on it, but gun to head, I'd say 8.5/10, being conservative to account for the post-completion hype.

Don't just skip through dialogues, really take in all the information you get. The game rewards you for paying attention and saying the right things at the right time. (It really helps that, with the Final Cut version at least, the game if fully voiced.)\n2) Keep an open mind. The game bombards you with all sorts of strange ideas from minute one, and it doesn't spend a lot of time explaining these ideas (which makes sense given the premise of the game). Take it all in and think about what it all means *to you*, and I think you can get a lot out of the experience.\n3) Don't save scum. This one is a bit hypocritical because I ended up doing just that for large portions of my playthrough. But looking back I wish I would've done less of it. Failure is a big part of the game's narrative and some truly amazing things can come out of you completely messing up a critical skill check. Just learn to let go and see where the game takes you instead of going back and aiming for that perfect outcome. Believe me, there is no perfect outcome.\n\nAnd that's it.

This is a 97% Metacritic scored game without a doubt. With [b]Disco Elysium: The Final Cut[/b] we are given the definitive version of the much-loved original from 2019. I am so glad I waited to play this version as it now comes fully voiced and with new content. It is an RPG that has very few peers, in fact I struggle to think of any other RPG that involves no combat (something we have come to expect from our RPG's). The thrill here comes from the dialog and the narrative (so good it feels like its own swordplay). While over the years we have certainly seen this medium evolve with the stories being told, this is the first time I feel like we have crossed over into full on literature territory.\n\nThe central mystery is compelling in the sense that it's so much more than simply solving a murder at the end of the world. It's window dressing and acts as a springboard for what becomes a deep dive into the human condition itself and how humanity simply cannot unf**k itself (no matter how hard it tries). It's also a highly charged socio-political drama that leaves nothing unscathed. Everything at some point has left deep scars and wounds on its people. It's no wonder your cop starts out with serious substance abuse issues, because the world he finds himself in has gone completely to sh*t pretty much a mirror of planet Earth today. It's a Shakespearean tragedy the master himself couldn't have told better had he lived in our interesting times.\n\nPlaying this game and then looking back at our reality, we may as well be back in a medieval play as we have a plague: check; all the lead characters of the play will probably die: check; the masses will all continue to suffer: check; we will call on the gods to assist us but as usual they are totally useless: check; no one wins: check. If you are hoping for some Deux ex machina to jump out from behind the curtain and save the day it's time for a reality check. I am sure Joyce will oblige. History will be damned if it ain't going to repeat itself.\n\nI know more about the history of Revachol, its surroundings and its people than I do about my own country. It's engrossing in a way that I can't quite explain. With its gorgeous isometric painterly graphics, you would think that such a wordy, tome of a game would be a slog to get through (please don't let that frighten you off). While I agree conversations with various NPC's can get particularly lengthy, they are never not engrossing which is a testament to the gorgeous writing on display here, especially now that the game includes full voice work for all the characters that inhibit this world.\n\nI have heard some people call the game boring, and I will agree it won't be for everyone, but boring is certainly not an adjective I would use to describe this game. [b]Disco Elysium: The Final Cut[/b] is anything but boring. Darkly funny but incredibly depressing at the same time, dense and very cerebral but still approachable and enjoyable. Its characters feel real and lived in , dealing with problems that are all too relatable. It does a stellar job at world building which feels organic, just like real life. It's brilliant. This may be my favourite game of all time, knocking [b]Bloodborne[/b] to second place. It is going to take something momentous to unseat this one as my personal favourite game played this year or any year for that fact.\n\n[h1]One word or phrase to sum up the experience[/h1]\n[i]I don't like using the word \"masterpiece\" as it's so overused, especially to describe mediocre affairs, but this truly is a masterpiece befitting of the words definition.[/i]\n\n[h1]Performance/Bug related incidents[/h1]\n[i]Having played this on the PC, I did not experience any crashes or bugs.[/i]\n\n[h1]Similar to games[/h1]\n[i][b]Planescape: Torment[/b], [b]Baldur's Gate 1/2[/b], [b]Divinity: Original Sin 1/2[/b][/i]\n\n[h1]Rating \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/h1]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869453048", "timestamp_created": 1626859565, "timestamp_updated": 1630260030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 190, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.904408574104309082", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118611543": {"recommendationid": "118611543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073526196", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 640, "last_played": 1679284966}, "language": "english", "review": "i wish french people were real", "timestamp_created": 1657513629, "timestamp_updated": 1657513629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 300, "votes_funny": 170, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903010189533233643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55788932": {"recommendationid": "55788932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989271430", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1573886935}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Beauty is Pain[/b]\nIn a throwaway poem, the fantasist Guy Gavriel Kay wonders why it is that airports are so grim and soul-crushing; we have the resources, he notes, to make them beautiful and humane.  There are, of course, all sorts of systemic and sound reasons for airports being as they are.  The same is true of RPGs.  For years I dreamed of quitting air travel, but it has proven impossible.  Giving up on RPGs turned out to be easier.  The endless grind of dumpster-diving for loot, ping-ponging between NPCs on \"quests,\" prebuffing as a lead-in to challenge-free grinding fights, min-maxing stats to achieve modest incremental changes that yielded merely more points to min-max, dialogue trees that were like administrative checklists (one dare not miss a step, but one hardly looks forward to any of them) ... all of this conspired to make me throw in the towel.\n\nAs I've previously [url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MarkY/20151125/260268/The_Fanatic_and_His_RPG.php]written[/url], The Age of Decadence managed to draw me in despite my reluctance to play more in this genre.  And I had the great good fortune to work on Torment: Tides of Numenera (in a small capacity), and thus pay homage to one of the games that has defined my own hobby as a writer, Planescape: Torment.  But despite these forays, or perhaps because of them, I have not brought myself to play any of the other significant RPG titles of the past decade.\n\nNevertheless, Disco Eysium (nee No Truce With the Furies) was sufficiently intriguing that I couldn't [i]not[/i] play.  I'm very glad to have overcome my prejudice.  DE answers Kay's question with, \"Yes, why not?\"  And it demonstrates that, with the gusto of delirious and slightly addled humanists, there is no reason why we [i]can't[/i] have an RPG that is achingly beautiful rather than crushingly dull.\n\nDE is a game about scars.  For most of my life, I believed that scars were a vestige of wound that had healed.  But it turns out that scars are patches on wounds that [i]never[/i] heal.  A scar, like any other part of your living body, must be constantly remade.  If you deprive your body of vitamin C (i.e., suffer from scurvy), the collagen that holds scars shut becomes unstable and the old wounds will open back up.  That is true even unto our bones; it turns out that there, too, failing collagen can cause old breaks to split apart again.  Once we're broken, we never really come back together again.\n\nDE is about a broken man exploring a broken city that plays host to a broken society.  Those breaks are mostly scarred over but -- like a scorbutic -- the man, the city, and the society have been starved of something essential to regeneration.  The game starts with the parallel bursting of a scar in the man and the society, and you are invited, in a very open way, to decide how you are going to address both the widening wounds and the underlying spiritual malnourishment.  If there is a way in which DE is most like PS:T, it is that both of them are about decoding a story of scarrified and tattooed flesh to understand the past and plot a way toward the future.\n\nBut DE and PS:T are not really similar games.  Both are beautiful (visually and verbally) games in unique settings populated with interesting characters who speak a lot of words.  But PS:T is still a fairly traditional RPG (you level up, fight enemies, memorize spells, overcome bosses, etc.), whereas DE is not.  \n\nDE's heart is its innovative \"internal dialogue\" system in which your skills talk to you (and you talk back to them).  PS:T really has nothing like this.  Where PS:T relies upon a roster of companions who serve as distorted mirrors of the protagonist's virtues and flaws, such that talking to them is in a sense talking to yourself (or, at least, talking through your issues), DE simply lets you talk to yourself outright.  It's novel, it's fun, and it's funny.  (PS:T had a funny [i]character[/i]; DE is a funny [i]game[/i], though the humor is extremely dark.)\n\nThis internal dialogue system makes the character creation and development process much more engaging.  In most RPGs, your stats and skills come into play fairly sparingly (from a narrative standpoint).  In DE, your stats shape every dialogue because even when you aren't employing the Rhetoric skill, say, to persuade someone, the Rhetoric skill is opining on the situation and shaping the player's (and the character's) understanding of what is happening.\n\nReally, I could go on for a long time about these mechanical innovations, but it's enough to say that you should play it for yourself to see a fresh and engaging approach to the genre.\n\nI'll end somewhat where I started.  At the end of your first day in DE, your partner remarks on the strange \"shuffle\" that detectives from your precinct seem to have, searching every container, and how exhausting it is to run back and forth all the time.  And as for dumpster-diving, you literally open a dumpster and sift through its contents, and earn money by collecting and selling empty bottles.  This goes beyond lampshading (and slyly winking at) the genre's flaw while still employing a tedious gameplay mechanic for want of creativity.  By turning the trash-collection into an explicit part of the narrative, it becomes not a point of \"ludonarrative dissonance\" (when did Aragorn stop to gather crud to offload at the local Gondorian merchant?) but a point of ludonarrative [i]consonance[/i].  DE's nameless, amnesiac protagonist (okay, another point of similarity with PS:T) has been reduced to such a shambles that he is literally recycling trash for pennies in hopes of paying for another night at the seedy local hostel.  The dehumanization of the that aspect of the gameplay speaks as eloquently as does the game's writing.\n\nThis is a must-play.

Even the game mechanics show that you cannot be everything, nor can you be the best all the time. You have to chose. You have failed, and you will fail again. You have hurt others, you are always running the risk of hurting them again, and vice versa. \nAnd you have to, somehow, find a way to go on. \nOr not. \n\nObvious as it is, this game touched me tremendously. And not even on a level that most games do, in form of being sad a while and then moving on. Or contemplating something for 5 minutes and then calling it a day. No, this is something different. This game has the capacity to strip you of your beliefs and putting them under a microscope. You may just find that you are a hypocrite, or that you have believed something naive, and not in the game world, but in the real one. \n\nAnd this is ultimately the amazing link this game has with the real world. It's just just fantastic *enough*, but it constantly calls back to this world through big or small references.

And who in the end suffers from that manipulation.\n\nIt never preaches, though. In the end, you decide everything; who or what to believe, what to make of the world. Up to you to find a reason to carry on.\n\nIt is not the ending that stood with me the most, it was the ENTIRETY of the game. It does not end in some big, firework-littered finish, but, almost surprisingly, just... ends. Calmly. The one objective is done, but there are so many things left to be invested in, and it feels like the story continues long after the ending credits. Just a testiment to how alive Disco Elysium's world is. \n\nIt would be impossible to tell you what this game does right, and it would be downright nitpicky and arrogant to list any of the (few, small) faults, because they cannot be compared to the wealth of good this game has in store. \n\nThere is so much left to touch on; the brilliant writing, the colourful and real characters, the art, the colours, the music, atmosphere, worldbuilding, everything.

Everyone is ready to point out that you are a pathetic excuse for a cop, an alcoholic, fan of bad music, and incapable of doing anything right.

Or a combination of all of these?  Or something entirely different?  That's the beauty of it, as it makes you role-play hard to figure out your character's place in this strange world that isn't ours.\n\nAs you go on about your business, your mind is constantly trying to help you, except you're such a mess that every aspect of you is now a character with its own voice and personality, admonishing you, or giving you hints, or just wasting your time.  And your choices many times depend on how friendly you are with those aspects of yourself.  Literally, as you will be putting \"skill points\" into the voices in your head, hoping they will help you get out of a bad situation, or provide you with enough panache that you will smooth talk some random person into opening themselves to you and reveal their secrets.\n\nThose are your objectives: talking to people and see where that takes you.  The choices are yours and every conversation is a complex battle of wits between whatever you're trying to be, the people who loathe your existence, and whatever aspect of your own mind decided to get in the way this time.

It's a unique game. I would say it's an rpg-point&click adventure game with some Kentucky Route Zero vibe.\n\nThe gameplay is quite simple yet amazingly good and satisfying. You inspect objects and pick up items, talk to people and talk to your...mind. This is where it gets more interesting. You have all those different brain parts responsible for something. There are four main skill trees and each is divided into subcategories.\nIntellect \u2013 logic, encyclopedia, rhetoric, drama, conceptualization, visual calculus.\nPsyche \u2013 volition, inland empire, empathy, authority, esprit de corps, suggestion.\nPhysique -  endurance, pain threshold, physical instrument, electro-chemistry, shivers, half light.\nMotorics \u2013 hand/eye coordination, perception, reaction speed, savoir faire, interfacing, composure.\nSome of these are self explanatory but others sound weird heh? Well, they are weird (in a good way) and that's what makes this game so amazing. These skills lead to various actions, dialogue options and consequences you can't even imagine. You can play it like a normal (almost) human being. But due to these skills and your mind talking to you, like empathy suggests one thing, logic another, drama throws something else, you get some crazy choices which could lead to hilarious moments.\nOh you must solve the murder case btw.\n\nSkills matter a lot and you must choose wisely but in the end you won't be able to do everything. Like I kicked the object and my health dropped to critical. But who cares \u2013 I am the law! Apocalypse is near and I need to get my hands on some drugs and fight the entities.\nIt's like a dark comedy. You'll laugh and if you pick certain dialogue options, you'll laugh like an idiot sitting in front of the screen and your wife will think you're going crazy.\n\nOh and there are thoughts which can be developed over time. You first need to unlock the thought, then start internalizing it and once its done it could give some bonuses. Like hobocop, superstar cop, cop of the apocalypse and more.\n\nThis is an exceptional game. It's hilarious but serious at the same time. It fascinates me how it plays with your mind and how it makes you doubt everything. You may start roleplaying as a certain kind of officer and at the end of the day become a better or worse human being. But sometimes you just stop and think \u201cmaybe I shouldn't do that anymore, it's dumb\u201d.\n\nThe game is very political but it doesn't promote any political ideology or it just shows that all of them suck. It plays with your mind. But when you pick one the game mocks your choice. And it doesn't matter what you pick, you always will feel like maybe you should've chosen differently. Or not? Is it a dream? Where am I? What are we doing? The end is nigh!\nYou'll meet communists, capitalists, racists, etc.\nMost people probably have political views and other things but imagine you don't know anything, you don't know who you are, what politics are or anything. So even the views you agree now might look differently if you learn about them when your head is completely blank.\n\nThe game is set in a fictional location and a lot of the events and things are fictional but each of those represent something from our world, each person represents a certain world view. You'll agree with some, you'll disagree with some, you'll cry for some, you'll mock some, you'll laugh your ass off with some and you'll make some of them suffer or maybe you'll find love. And probably you'll even find someone who represents yourself in real life and since the game likes to mock you it could lead to you feeling stupid and think about your views, are they really good? Is that what I want? I see the idea of the game as \u201cdoubt everything and think for yourself\u201d.\n\nThe area you can explore is tiny when you compare it to other games, in some way it's similar to Yakuza, tiny map filled with content. There's so much quality content in this game. This is a proof that you don't need a vast ubicrappy open areas, what matters is quality content.\n\nI love how it transforms in mood. One minute it could be a hilarious game, next minute it turns into a gloomy, depressive piece of art. It's an emotional rollercoaster, it will make laugh, cry, think, you'll sometimes be lost in your thoughts. You think who are you, are you really what you want to be, you might rethink your values. And there are some thoughts i've already been thinking about like what is nothing? How can you measure nothing and if nothing is really nothing, how nothing can exist if it's nothing, it must be something then?\n\nYou try to rebuild your reputation and take your life into your hands or you embrace whatever mindset you want, alcoholic, corrupt cop, hobo, crazy cop spreading the message that apocalypse is coming. There's also no way to get along with everybody so you make a choice whit whom you want to be nice. Skillchecks play a huge role in dialogues and sometimes you could end up in a situation when a young kid tells you're his bitch now and you feel completely humiliated so you start taking drugs and find hobo friends, crazy people, you feel at home.\n\nItems like clothing and tools play a role too. Clothes give you bonuses to some stats.\nConsumable items are used to restore your hp & morale or for buffs. But while they increase one stat, they lower other one. I strongly advise saving your drugs for tough situations. Unless you have electrochemistry leveled up like me, my pockets were full of drugs. Smoke a cig, some beer, sniff speed, you're a super cop.\n\nAll the characters in the game are more or less important and every single one of them is fun to talk to. You'll also hear some phrases or words you rarely hear in games and most people probably won't get it, but eastern europeans will understand and start to laugh instantly. On top of that there's more stuff for eastern europeans.\n\nGraphically the game looks amazing. Although the graphics are mainly 2D backrounds with 3D character models but those backgrounds and overall artstyle is amazing. You can see there has been so much work dedicated to the art. Every area, every corner is something special and tells a story. The game looks like a painting sometimes, especially in those more surreal points of the game.\nPerformance is great, no hiccups, no fps drops, game runs very smoothly. But loading times are way too long. Saving system is very frustrating. Because when you overwrite that doesn't change the name of the save.\n\nSound. I waited until developers added full voice overs. And voice acting is mostly amazing. The narrator voice is absolutely wonderful. Including all the characters and horrific necktie, it's hilarious. I only disliked lymbic system.\nThe dialogues are the main thing in this game and every single dialogue means something and you want to hear it.\nThere are only couple of jazzy tracks but they're great. It feels kind of sad but calming at the same time and combined with atmosphere it creates that surreal vibe.\n\nAmazing, unique game, a masterpiece. I recommend this to everyone, you can play it however you like and there are multiple ways to achieve your goal. There's no skill required or anything so it's suitable for everyone. It's a blend of rpg and point&click which will leave a footprint in your brain forever.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Great engaging story\n[*]Interesting characters\n[*]Freedom to do and be what you want\n[*]Small map filled with content\n[*]Beautiful art\n[*]Great soundtrack\n[*]Great voice acting\n[*]Hilarious\n[*]Depressive\n[*]Unique skill system\n[*]Failing is an option\n[*]Game plays with your mind\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]No summary after ending\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]\n\n[url=https://www.twitch.tv/crazykosmikbunny] [b]My Twitch[/b] [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1624482527, "timestamp_updated": 1651412282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 204, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895160853862762451", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70625056": {"recommendationid": "70625056", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960600216", "num_games_owned": 891, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1317, "last_played": 1591875438}, "language": "english", "review": "Expect to read a lot of text.

I'd say it's actually point&click adventure game with RPG elements. With a huge world to discover and literal walls of text to go through, the game is just awesome if you really get into the story, and assuming you're not in a rush, it's a solid 60+ hours of single player experience if you want to discover majority of what the game has to offer.\n\nAt the same time I realize that the game isn't for everybody and the reading has its limits. It's not really suitable for long sessions, simply because your brain will burn before, unintentionally pushing you more and more towards skipping dialogues and lore. The game has awesome setting, awesome story to tell, marvelous characters to meet and interesting case to solve, all with major plot-twists, but it takes time to get used to and willpower to get deep enough.\n\nPersonally I enjoyed the game greatly and I'm happy to recommend it to everybody who wants to see what a real story-driven RPG game looks like, and how you can even create RPG video game without fighting mobs, looting, grinding and fetch quests. There are also not that many detective-based games that do it good, making Disco Elysium a good position to pick for people into it, even though you'll most likely be doing EVERYTHING but solving the case.\n\nMy brain needs to rest now, that was really a journey into something else.

And one of the areas I teach is \"Interactive Fiction\", including video games.  And you know what?  Getting fellow faculty to recognize that \"games\" can be art is an uphill battle... especially those who teach 19th century Romanticism or whatnot.\n\nDisco Elysium is a game that might help non-game snobs recognize the unique artistic power of videogames.  The writing is wonderful - like a beautiful expressionistic novel.  The choices MATTER.  The branching story structure means you stress over every dialogue choice... but failure is sometimes just a wonderful journey in and of itself.  And because it's not a game that requires a degree of skill with a mouse and keyboard or gamepad, it's accessible for even non-gamers.  \n\nThe visual art design is gorgeous for a game of this type. Not the cookie-cutter \"fantasy steampunk\" you normally get, but beautiful expressionistic painting-like portraits and landscapes.  The emotional tone throughout is bleak yet powerfully evocative.  \n\nObviously there is a lot of reading.  There is some voice acting (of varying quality) but most of the dialogue and description is text-only.  Which works great for this game - again, it's like reading a great novel. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this adventure.  The dialogue systems in other games will pale in comparison.", "timestamp_created": 1573680944, "timestamp_updated": 1577623027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 372, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885067760944366455", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55617221": {"recommendationid": "55617221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160761740", "num_games_owned": 906, "num_reviews": 232, "playtime_forever": 2911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1333, "last_played": 1626528993}, "language": "english", "review": "Full review here: http://indiannoob.in/disco-elysium-review-investigations-in-a-dying-culture/\n\nIs Disco Elysium the best RPG of all time? That's very subjective. But I can surely say that it's the best RPG of it's kind since Planescape: Torment (you'll be hearing this a lot more).\n\nSince I've mentioned Torment here, there is no need to explain what kind of an RPG Disco Elysium is.\nIf you're a person who doesn't enjoy reading extremely detailed walls of text frequently for 10+ minutes at a time, then this is not the right RPG for you.\nIf it's combat you look forward to the most, then this is not the right RPG for you.\nYou're still here? Good. Disco Elysium is many things. It's part tense detective drama, part goofy buddy cop fiction, part Existential Crisis-The Game, part self-discovery book, part disturbing Irvine Welsh novel all in one. \nOther than that, it's really hard to explain how weird and uncanny Disco Elysium truly is.\n\n+ The super-detailed writing, unique retro setting and suspenseful story\n+ Dialogue simulator\n+ The 'ol amnesiac trope but pulled off well\n+ Role play as either drunk cop, bad cop, slightly good cop, druggie cop, hobo cop, butthole cop, superstar  cop or even apocalyptic cop     \n+ Punch a junkie kid in the face, scream I AM THE LAW in the face of the elderly, lick alcohol off a desk, steal THE shoes off a dead body\n+ Drink yourself to death, cry in front of a mob boss, have the aforementioned junkie kid make you his lil' bish, \n+ Substance abuse- lots and lots of substance abuse\n+ Engage in discussions with the multitude of voices in your head\n+ 24 unique skills, each having its own use\n+ Develop upto 16 unique thoughts in your head per playthrough to further define your character. Become a feminist and ask people if they have a phallus in their ear.\n+ Skillchecks, skillchecks everywhere\n+ Despite the heavy dialogue-driven gameplay, the character models are well animated\n+ Beautiful, painting like visuals\n+ Amazing soundtrack\n\n-Abrupt ending\n- No traditional combat system. All combat encounters take place through dialogues and skill checks. Not really a con but can be a turn off to some\n- Fixed character like in Torment (But you modify his attributes, skills, can shape his personality and decide how the world percieves you)\n- The story-driven nature of the game results in the player not having the freedom to do things other RPGs offer (like beat the living shit out of random NPCs)\n- Not a challenging game at the slightest\n- The game is not really 'open world' in the traditional sense \n- Time moves forward when you talk to people/take part in scripted events (Simply walking around doesn't count). Though you get plenty of time to talk to people and explore before a day ends, timed stuff annoys the hell out of me. \n- Some of the load times are kind of long even on an SSD\n- Cannot pan the camera or change movement controls (Double clicking to run all the time becomes tiring) \n- Sometimes the pathfinding is iffy\n- Need the ability to customize UI elements\n\nSimply one of the best RPG I've played in recent times (and I've played a lot). Do note that Disco Elysium will only appeal to a certain RPG crowd (those that aren't turned off by text-driven narrative)\nAlso remember to turn off the political side of your brain before taking the plunge. Disco Elysium is a self-conscious game that may or may not offend some of your beliefs. But it's all in good spirits.", "timestamp_created": 1571155520, "timestamp_updated": 1571913008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 354, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.884927332401275635", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 38450, "total_negative": 2788, "total_reviews": 41238}, "cursors": {"AoIIPyo9xXnJ9IME": "Fri Oct  6 16:33:51 2023"}}
