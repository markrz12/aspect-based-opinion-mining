It's got a huge open world to explore and sail through, and if you can get in with some friends it can be a great time. Mechanically, the game is phenomenal and I'd love to sink hundreds of hours into it. \n\nBut the community is the worst I've seen since League of Legends. I imagine there has to be a tremendous overlap in the player base between them, because it's too depressing to consider that there are THIS many people who are THAT terrible to each other. I haven't been able to sail a single voyage in ages without having someone chase my ship for hours while screaming every slur they know into their awful $10 microphones. \n\nI tried to love this game, I really did. Those few times I got to just play with my friends I had a great time. But there is no matchmaking - when you set out, you're up against anyone who might be playing. You can have 10 hours of player time to their thousand. It doesn't matter. And if you're not interested in the PVP aspect? Tough luck, there's no opting out. Most players don't bother with the world events or the voyages, it seems. They just sail around looking for someone who already gathered up their treasure and then chase them for hours. And that's not hyperbole - I've seen players get chased (and have frequently BEEN chased) from one side of the map all the way to the other. It shocks me that someone is still having fun with that, that someone is just THAT dedicated to ruining someone else's time that this is how they spend hours. There's no downside to this style of play, either. I imagine the game encourages it. \n\nThe sea monsters and AI ships are a lot of fun to fight, but they actually make the toxic community WORSE. If the kraken decides to wrap itself around your ship while someone's attacking you, you're just doomed. The AI will lock onto one target and utterly ignore anything else in the vicinity, usually leaving them free to, once again, scream all the naughty no-no words that their parents don't let them say when they're at home while you slowly die from the combined onslaught of a literal kraken and another player ship.\n\nThere's no way to coordinate joining a server with your friends' ships already on them to form an alliance together if you wanted to try to just play with friends, either. Rare seemingly attempted to fix this by coming up with community days and community weekends, where rewards were massively increased. This encourages teaming up with others on the server to maximize benefits across the board. This somehow seems to only make the toxic community WORSE. In the entirely of the last community day weekend, I was unable to speak with a single player. Most of them were just screaming - not even words, just screaming incoherently - into their mics while chasing/attacking any ship they could find. \n\nThe game also has a serious problem with hackers. I can't count the number of times I've seen someone board my ship and stand around getting blasted by shotguns and facetank all of it without moving. Supposedly the game has a report system, but it relies on an Xbox account and requires you to know the person's name. Most hackers I've seen have had incomprehensible names or are just literally nameless, not that it matters because I'M PLAYING ON STEAM AND DON'T USE AN XBOX ACCOUNT. \n\nMaybe I just have the worst luck in the world. Maybe there are some decent people to play with out there. But I haven't found them, and I can no longer convince my friends this game is worth playing, so why would I bother playing it without them? \n\nThis is a great game utterly ruined by a terribly toxic community.", "timestamp_created": 1680130899, "timestamp_updated": 1680131488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1459, "votes_funny": 122, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894263505935668945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145540519": {"recommendationid": "145540519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060141839", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2313, "playtime_at_review": 151950, "last_played": 1696491134}, "language": "english", "review": "After 2500 hours of play time I think I can safely say this is a fun, entertaining game", "timestamp_created": 1693678527, "timestamp_updated": 1693678527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 449, "votes_funny": 68, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891745388507843018", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134341729": {"recommendationid": "134341729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239989692", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 32908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32908, "last_played": 1695281069}, "language": "english", "review": "Look, I love this game. I really do. But there are serious, fundamental issues with the current implementation of multiplayer.\n\nFirst off- PvP is profoundly unfun for and unfair to small crews and people not dedicated to the PvP grind. Ganking is astoundingly easy, and 100% the meta strategy- all players have the same amount of health and do the same amount of damage, so large crews just fill your boat with more players than you can reasonably fight and spawnkill you until you sink. Overall, the skill floor for this game is way too high, and players self select into groups that make it worse- players who play the game for PvP will naturally become more skilled at PvP than players who play the game for PvE. As such, PvE players are sitting ducks, easy prey. And, even worse- with captaincy, a ship can be ready for a fight in less than a minute. It takes [i]hours[/i] to build up a PvE loot stash of any meaningful value. So PvP ships can just throw themselves at PvE ships until they eventually lose- and, let's be real, when you lose you're screwed. They'll cash out immediately. It's way too easy to get Level 5 Reaper. So, as a small-crew PvE player, the game becomes heart-stoppingly stressful. And the devs don't seem to get this- they continue to make running away even harder. Which would be fine in a game where the stakes were lower, but is total crap in a game with enormous stakes and an even enormous-er aggressor advantage. You want to talk about realism? It's realistic that a tiny merchant ship would see a big hulking pirate galleon trudge up from under the horizon and be able to get the hell out of dodge.\n\nSecond, the ability for anyone- even allies- to backstab you is exciting and interesting on paper, but in practice is just an enormous impediment to camaraderie and community building. If I'm allied with a crew that I can't keep tabs on at all times, and I have any real amount of loot, I just plain can't leave my ship. We can't hang out, can't go on island voyages together- I can't spend time with other players without the risk of being betrayed and sunk. Without any form of loyalty assurance, this game is a profoundly lonely experience- compounded by the astoundingly sparse servers, at least partly limited in density because of the serious threat each new ship represents to your hoard.\n\nIs all of this a skill issue? [b]Yes, 100%[/b]. I'll be the first to admit that I'm garbage at PvP. But, frankly, PvP matches as a solo are just so slow, complicated, expensive, and frustrating that I don't have enough IRL time and motivation to commit to the grind. The constant threat of attack is exciting, and vital to the gameplay loop's challenge and significance, but the odds are so far skewed in the aggressor's favor that it's just not fun.\n\nEdit: I'm really disappointed by the announcement of Safer Seas. I guarantee that if the fundamental issues with balancing and the gameplay loop were addressed, people wouldn't be clamoring for a PvE mode. Rather than take a good hard look at [i]why[/i] people want PvE, they've decided to throw it in there and call it a day. It doesn't solve anything.

This feature would allow you to take appropriate action against cheating players and help to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players.\n\nI hope that you will take this feedback into consideration and work towards creating a fair and enjoyable experience for all players.\n\nSincerely,\nA mad player", "timestamp_created": 1673780361, "timestamp_updated": 1673780361, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 293, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841350376605987549", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129136204": {"recommendationid": "129136204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008376294", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 476, "playtime_forever": 52837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 967, "last_played": 1687341735}, "language": "english", "review": "An audiovisual masterpiece (that water!) which does a decent job at concealing its repetitiveness and shortage of content behind the joy of being a pirate.", "timestamp_created": 1671845092, "timestamp_updated": 1671845092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839619040489196777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139342337": {"recommendationid": "139342337", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971628645", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14370, "last_played": 1691295390}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game but the cheating is completely out of hand.

game slowly run itself into the depths, SoT at its core is a good game I'm not posting this review complaining about that.\n\nHowever, I am writing this Review as i have hit a brickwall with the Moderators and Rare themselves and more than likely will be Permanently banned soon as they are getting tired of Removing my posts which are calling them out in regards to their recent \"But we banned X\" accounts post.\n\nSoT has a lot of potential, It fills that Niche of allowing the user to explore freely while also giving them the choice if they want to do PvE, Fishing, PvP, Ambush Tactics, Alliances, Hunting, Exploring, Questing, Story, Trying to break the game?\n\nBut something it has always struggled with is Hackers, And ever since they released \"Hourglass\" that problem has only doubled as you need Rank 100 to get the \"Cool Hip New Cosmetics\" forcing players to do PvP which then leads to more people using hacks to succeed in PvP rather than get good at the game as people can get away with Hacking as long as it isn't blatant and as long as it isn't Video Recorded.\n\nWhen you mention Hackers the Forum Mods remove it and label \"Misinformation\" and when you call out that choice they then flag you with \"Baiting staff\" and threaten to Perma ban you. If there wasn't an issue people wouldn't talk about Hackers. If you mention Emporium aswell? They get very angry.\n\nEmporium is a whole 'nother issue, When i first started i thought Emporium was great bought a couple skins was enjoying myself . . Until i noticed a pattern. Y'see people get REALLY angry when you have Paid Cosmetics in-game they go out of their way to harass Emporium users. Soon as i removed my Cosmetics the behaviour changed again people aren't as aggressive. \n\nRare is known for putting all their eggs in a single basket y'see, They put everything into Voyages (One time content) and Emporium. Well, Atleast for last two years.\n\nSure, They added Captaincy (Which is garbage) because it gives you zero control over your own damned ship but also doesn't let you modify anything important (Anchor) (Barrels) & (Cannons) Nobody cares about Trinkets or paintings Majority of captained vessels i've seen are all Copy Paste aside from the \"Ship Name\"\n\nThen you have Hourglass, Arguably one of the worst things to happen to SoT. \n\nHourglass itself is fine, However the server issues that came alongside it? The forced interaction with PvP to get Cosmetics or Titles? The In-equality of ship supplies in matchmade PvP? The \"MMR SYSTEM\" which is fake and doesn't actually do anything? Not okay.\n\nThey seem hardstuck trying to push PvP instead of add features people have basically begged for years for.\n\nStill no new Big Encounter (Meg / Kraken)\n\nStill no new content for storms so no reason to EVER enter one aside from escape fleas who run when you try to fight em but follow when you dont.\n\nStill no new region, Volcano is DoA nobody EVER goes in unless voyage forces it.\n\nStill no new Enemies, We still have PoTC enemies acting as \"New\" content.\n\nNo new ships, No meaningful ship customization, Still can't restrict players (On your team) as a captain from using Anchor aside from raising it.\n\nNo reason to level Hunter Call\n\nNo reason to EVER use Order Of Souls\n\nThe Devs think \"Reworking\" Islands count as new content even though i've never seen a single soul explore said \"Reworked\" islands (Fort Merrick) you go to islands to collect and sell loot and then leave just as fast.\n\nMajority of their community still hasn't seen the new Cutscene for Flame or Athena cause 100 PvP Ranks is too much.\n\nMajority of their community won't do World Events cause they know it's not worth the hassle you clear while watching horizon.\n\nOverwhelming Majority won't touch Sunken shrines cause you have to leave ship defenseless to clear the shrine and because of that Ocean Curse is always going to be ultra rare.\n\nI've only seen people do FaF / FoF (However you want to spell it) / (Activated World Event with Ritual Skull) Maybe once, Nobody is dumb enough to waste their own time to have the work potentially stolen by every hippie in the server.\n\nThe Tutorial for the game STILL after ALL OF THESE YEARS does not teach the user Windmanagement which is why so many people exit Tutorial and are so god damned clueless about why the ship isn't moving fast.\n\nHell, The Tutorial doesn't even teach you how to stop the ship an extremely unhealthy amount of people rely on Anchor to do ANYTHING. Majority don't know that Harpoon can grab loot either until people show you it.\n\nZero Tutorial for fishing either, The Quality Of Life features are Awful for new players.\n\nDon't have friends? Time to enjoy sifting through Random Queue after Random Queue of people that want to Sabotage or just want to join for payout and leave right after. When you raise concern? Get told \"Use Discord not our problem\" instead of the Devs getting off their arse and making an actual Lobby List instead of \"Randomly Queue and pray\"\n\nCaptaincy should allow the player to write a \"Custom Message\" for their Ship which appears in \"Lobby List\" and allows the user to choose for themselves if they want to join \"Fishing Boat\" or \"Shrines\" or \"PvP\" or \"Meg Hunters\" or \"Story Enjoyers\" or \"Achievement Hunting\"\n\nZero, And i mean, ZERO Quality of life for users they expect / demand you use Discord to matchmake otherwise enjoy sifting for an hour to get people that wanna play SoT.\n\nComplete focus on Cash Shop, In-game stuff from last year and half has been awful aside from PvP Content.\n\nAnd for all the money they're making? They have worse servers than Warcraft 3 Reforged, I don't suggest buying the game in current state. They don't care about hackers unless they cheat the paid currency, They don't care about server security, They don't care about PvE players, They don't care about how bad the servers are running and the rubber banding.\n\nAny other game? I have 20ms max, This game? Comfortable 90ms at all times if not higher.\n\nI wasn't going to write this review but y'know what? If they want to Silence me on forums, Fine.\nYou can't delete Reviews without paying off Steam, So better get shelving money to Steam if you don't want my Review up can't silence me otherwise.\n\nTLDR; Good game, Awful Community, Awful Developers, And Awful Quality Of Life.", "timestamp_created": 1689327853, "timestamp_updated": 1689327853, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830429911613464355", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145826788": {"recommendationid": "145826788", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231626064", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 362, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1696178755}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this game has water in it.", "timestamp_created": 1694052889, "timestamp_updated": 1694052889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 202, "votes_funny": 109, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826536715030670166", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143266525": {"recommendationid": "143266525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382376991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4382, "last_played": 1694350892}, "language": "english", "review": "On my first day sailing my new captained ship (I named it Maurice), we were fighting a skeleton fleet and we're struggling. We still have enough resources to sink the skelly galleon, but we are definitely struggling as we are playing a sloop (the smallest boat with the least firepower). \n\nThen, someone came into our ship, saying that he's friendly and wanted to help us defeat the skelly ship since he said we've been struggling a lot. We were wary at first, but there's something about him that made him so trustworthy. It may be because his english is so nice and the way he talks is so friendly and inviting, so we decided to trust him and have him at the helm while the rest of us shoot/repair our ship. The guy came in with a brig, which is stationed on the other side of the skelly ship (also shooting at the skelly ship). \n\nLong story short, we sunk the galleon, and tons of treasure float on the sea. We haven't seen so much treasure before, so we thanked the brig guys for their help and asked them if they wanted to share some of the spoils. They declined, and asked us to just hook every treasure on our ship.\n\nWe then chatted a bit, about how their ship has a glowy red effects on the front. Taught us about factions in the battle for sea of thieves and had us join the opposing faction. Our ship now has a glowy blue effect in the front, and we got really happy since my ship (Maurice) looks so cool now. \n\nThis is the first time I've met such nice people on the game, I thought, as all the people so far have been nothing but hostile to us. All the nice people we've met are either new to the game, or are semi-retired and they're just helping us out because we seemed new. These guys are on a whole 'nother level we thought. \n\nOne last time, we offered them the treasure, at least to share since they deserved it. They have reaper level 5 emissiary too, which would sell really great. The conversation roughly goes something like:\n\"Look man, thanks a lot for your help, feel free to take any treasure from the ship we're happy to share\"\n\"oh really? I guess I'll take some then. You know what I'll take?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"everything.\"\n\nI thought he was joking, I thought that bastard was joking. His friend on the ship started shooting cannons at us. I tried to jokingly negotiate with him, to let us go and we'll drop some treasure for him, but he did not budge. He dropped our anchor, set fire to Maurice, and sunk our ship.

There's so much content I love that doesn't relate people. \n\nMore often than not I just want to farm my fishing rank, by selling it to the emissary in the sea post, and some degenerates in a huge boat will gank me and kill me for 8 bananas in my possession, and then if I display my displeasure towards such unnecessary retaliation, I get insulted and told \"IT's cALleD seA oF THievES, nOt SeA oF cUcks\". Okay man, do you even hug your mother? Do you need some sort of support? You spend your money constantly on boat skins and seasons passes but can't even afford therapy? Bro. Let me fish in peace, I don't want your smoke. \n\nSometimes I'm just focusing on the tales and literally have only 8 bananas in my possession, you bet your runt I will sail into the red sea and make you waste your precious time if you follow me.\n\nI would love if this game had a Single Player option, or an option in which I could host to play with my friends, some people just wanna focus on the lore, and fight Mobs and NPC's. \n\nYou're not any better than me if you play this game 24/7 and constantly pick reaper to torment people that aren't even engaging in battle with you. \n\nLet me do my thing, and enjoy the SAME game I bought with my money, the way I see fit. Just like you.\n\nThat argument that it's called Sea of Thieves and blah blah blah, is dog water. It just shows you use little to no brain and think only your way of thinking is the right one. If you really have this mentality, you're boring. \n\nAnyway, that's all.

To achieve streamlined performance at max settings is not a great leap even for a dated machine. However the implementation is most impressive, with constant moments that are screenshot worthy, and a truly immersive environment.\n\nThe key component to effecting this is the wave modelling. Lurching along then screaming your way down the backend of waves or calmly puddling with a cross wind pulling your vessel to full heel is an incredibly satisfying experience.\n\nWhile the game itself is wildly open ended, with tons of fascinating little islands, hidden grottos, undersea shrines/temples, fortified outposts, sunken wrecks and other special locations to discover and explore, there are also organised activities along the lines of [b]\"Tall Tales\"[/b]  and event quests that appear in conjunction with the games [b]Seasons[/b], currently in its 8th iteration.\n\n[b]Tall Tales[/b], are what one might term Campaign Missions. And while the lore and backstory of the area we are playing in is provided through these there is also a superb [b][i]Pirates of the Caribbean[/i][/b] tie in with good old [i]Captain Jack Sparrow[/i] and the rest of the movie characters showing an appearance. While many believe [i]Johnny Depp[/i] was used to voice the iconic wobbly captain, it was in fact a voice actor by the name of [i]Jared Butler[/i]. I challenge you to detect the difference. Mr Butler has voiced Depp's part in other cartoons and video games including Depp's Mad Hatter character.\n\nTo circle back to the [b]Seasons[/b], these have been used to further major plotlines as well as game dynamics, with the 4th Season introducing an entire new island and faction for example, while the current season has organised [i]Ship vs Ship PvP[/i] queues that result in your vessel diving beneath the waves [b]Flying Dutchman[/b] style to emerge adjacent to your matched enemy for some swopping of cannonball holes.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[hr][/hr]\nShip combat has some unique additions to what you may be expecting from similar titles. While the standard hurling of wirling iron is the primary combat choice, your cannon may be filled with firebombs, shrapnel shells, chainshot, cursed balls (forces dancing or inebriates entire crew!) and even....yourself. Or your pets.\n\nLaunching yourself out of a cannon is the most effective, if aimed correctly, method of boarding enemy vessels. And while you have harpoons at your disposal, climbing a ladder out of the water will most likely result in meeting a blunderbuss to the eyeball as you clamber on deck.\n\n[i]All player combat is on an equal footing, as the 3 gun options and sword you have on first spawn are the only ones available in game. The HP percent taken per weapon is:[/i]\n[list]\n[*] Sword - 25 swing / 75 thrust\n[*] Flintlock Pistol - 55\n[*] Eye of Reach (sniper) - 75\n[*] Blunderbuss - 10 shells @10 each\n[/list]\nFor those that find PvP a hinderance to game enjoyment, it is 90% of the time avoidable once you learn how to be aware of your surroundings.\n\nSimply scanning the horizon will alert you to potential threats, and using chat to ask people their intentions can be effective once you learn that most squeakers are idiots. However if you are accosted on foot, dying will respawn you on your vessel if it is still floating after a quick visit to The Ferryman. The different vessels are threefold:\n[list]\n[*] Sloop : 1-2 person crew, turns fastest and when sailing directly in the no go zone (headwind) is the fastest ship in game. 2 Cannons.\n[*] Brigantine : 2-3 person crew, possible to solo but tricky, has medium turning speed and is the fastest on a broad reach. 4 Cannons.\n[*] Galleon : 4 person crew, really hard to solo and tricky with 2, has slow turning speed and is fastest on a dead run. 8 Cannons.\n[/list]\n\nThis obviously translates as well to PvE ship combat vs Skeleton crews, Tall Tales events and Ghost ships...as well as....other things.\n\n[h1]Overall a personally suprising title, with something for everybody, a very affordable Steam price, and longetivity to boot.

Especially with newer updates only increasing the rewards for veteran players. Starting out in this game is pretty much a nightmare especially if you want to experience the game authentically without sweating some online guide of how to get rich quick, which half the time won't really work. You'll be earning almost no gold, if you try to earn more gold through trading companies sorry, you're under attack by a max rep Reaper who does nothing but pvp 24/7 by exploiting every single \"strat\" that exists in-game. By the time you get to earning any kind of normal rewards you'll be tired of the game and want to quit.\n- As I mentioned before in the good part of the game, trading companies are a very nice system that is sadly ruined by Sea of Thieves insistence to reward pvp players and veterans, which really goes hand in hand as most veteran players are usually pvp sweats on Reaper. It's pretty much useless to be an Emissary for any other TC as you'll have to spend insane amounts of time grinding to earn any kind of normal reward, that is if you aren't attacked by a Reaper ship every 5 minutes.  So your choices are a) learn some kind of quick and easy way to farm gold, ruining any kind of authentic gameplay experience or b) be forced to become a pvp Reaper sweat, basically ruining the point of Trading Companies since to really reap the true benefits of the system you are forced to only play one type of playstyle. \n- The community might be one of the worst, most self unaware cesspits to exist on planet Earth. You will rarely find a community this toxic and yet so unapologetic. They will completely ruin the game experience for any new players, tell you to get good as if you even have the chance to do so, praise every update that helps veteran players only and then be BAFFLED and absolutely ASTONISHED that new players who simply did not even have a chance to enjoy the game complain about it and will start blaming them for just not becoming better. A massive excuse is \"It's a pirate game\" \"There is gonna be fighting\", ok, then just remove every other system from the game. What's the point of the TCs, any islands, questlines etc. if it's just a pvp game, might as well leave the outposts only, make the map smaller and just make it a full pvp game. I am convinced half the fanbase just ignore the \"adventure\" and \"open world\" and \"exploration\" tags for the game.

They just do it because they want you to know that they're better than you since they play the game 18 hours a day and are using the latest strategies.\n\nAnd then there's the people who sink your empty ship whilst you're listening to a Tall Tale's dialogue. (Why are there no safe zone's around these places?) Meaning you have to listen to that dialogue again AND sail your ship back to the area for the teleport to the mission area.\n\nAnd Rare have confirmed they don't give a shit, and they won't separate out this part of the community. They support the toxic part of the game, and you'll like it and be forced to engage with them.\n\nOtherwise, the game is really fun, and when you run into players who actually role play a little, or don't just shoot immediately - It's nice.

I will break it down in a pros & cons list.\n\nPros:\n+ Great with Friends (Total of 4 crew members on the largest ship, including yourself).\n+ Plenty to do (Quests, Treasure Maps for that Looty Booty, Fishing, PVE Plundering).\n+ PVE is actually rather entertaining and rewarding.\n+ Large map. Plenty of islands, outposts & secrets to find and explore.\n+ A few different ships for different crew sizes.\n+ Variety of tools, weapons & ammo types to utilise.\n+ Customisation options for both the ship & player. \n+ Pets (Dogs, Cats, Foxes, Parrots, Monkeys).\n+ Sea Shanties.\n\nCons:\n- PVP in all areas. I've been attacked at sea, spawn camped on my own boat and ambushed at an outpost where I was trying to sell my haul of loot. There is no passive zones, or passive mode upon spawn with a \"x\" amount of time before you start taking damage again, which is rather annoying.\n- Sea of Thieves has a rather crappy community, some people will avoid you or be nice to you, but most will try to kill you just for sport and the slim chance of loot.\n- Useless reporting system. Can't report racism, griefing or any type of harassment without a video of it happening. Most reports without that get ignored.\n- Less enjoyable by your lonesome. It's not terrible, it's just better with friends.\n- No private sessions. I just want to sail the seas with the lads, maybe battle a skeleton crew or two, is that so much to ask for?\n- Requires a XBOX / Microsoft Account.\n\nIn general, this game is actually pretty awesome and has been a source of great entertainment for myself & pals over the last few days, but the community leaves a lot too be desired. The fact that you can't have a Friends-only or a PVE-only session just really drives it home that there will always be somebody around trying to mess with your fun.\nBuy it, but only if you've got a few friends willing to play with you.

Negative review, even if there's plenty to love.\n\nNow for the meat of it: the corp speak from the latest news is hilarious and a spit in the face for the people who want to love the game, but can't.  You know, the countless people who want to sail around and enjoy the myriad of PVE content the game has to offer, but keep getting murdered and griefed at every which turn. And, of course, when people bring it up online?  The \"best in gaming\" community just fires back with 'git good' or 'play something else'.  It's this community that makes me avoid everything in the world from being around the community.  See someone docked at an outpost?  Avoid them like the plague, go find another outpost.  See someone out at sea?  Again, avoid like the plague, go the complete other direction (while using your ship's speed advantage, that they don't explain for new players and everything I've learned I've had to read online).\n\nThat said, I'd be remiss to say there isn't plenty I enjoy!  Seriously, I plugged in 100+ hours before I knew it and want to actively spend more money on the game to play Pirate Barbie.  Vibing with some fishing, sailing around from gorgeous waters and islands doing quests/voyages, taking in the charm of all the NPCs they've sprinkled about, the music, the sound design...  There are.  So many.  Cool things.  Going on.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  I genuinely and completely want to adore this game, but the community that Microsoft/Rare wants to tote as being amazing is....  honestly, anything but when you encounter them in-game.\n\nWill I probably try and do a few more commendations to keep myself occupied after this review?

Like, you literally couldn't have validated that part of my review any more than you have in replies. Saying just \"skill issue\" or just insults is removed. Actual convos only. Be civil. \n\nSecond, \"Not mad,\" just honest. I never said I wasnt going to keep playing, just pointing out flaws, its a review after all. I am just saying if you dont like Rust, skip this, its pirate Rust. Its not a good \"casual\" game. Yes, I play it every night, on a galleon I bought, with 3 other friends. Doesnt mean solo play isnt almost entirely trash for the most part. Lack of people isn't the issue. Its lack of balance for solo players.\n\nThird, no one cares that you never saw a cheater. They still exist, they still mess with people, and all that proof is on YouTube. Game needs a report button. I HAVE 200 HOURS IN 40 DAYS, I SAW 6.\n\n_____\nI'll start by saying I love the game, but it has a lot of stuff that makes me feel like I cant recommend it past \"if you're a rust player who wants to be a pirate and abuse certain parts of the game.\" The game is super fun, super atmospheric, and when you can at least fight people and get in ship battles and have a fair fight it's super fun. Looks great, feels great, easy to pick up, hard to master. It's even better with friends. That said, there's a few flaws with the game. A few, but the issue is that they are very big and obvious flaws within Sea of Thieves.\n\nLAND COMBAT: Combat in the game is really really simple but is infested with people who abuse bugs and mechanics to cheese. This really shows when you literally can't do anything as a solo player against anyone who isn't solo due to these terrible bugs and mechanics people abuse within the combat system. You want to sword fight someone? Well, unless you got a group of buddies the same size as them, prepare to have people animation cancel with the sword lunge to fly 35 yards and one shot you if you were too busy fighting their duo, or the duo just shoots you in the back with a Blunderbuss or pistol. You wanna sword fight 1v1? Nah, they'll just abuse the fact that you can phase through players to just keep running through you and your block to hit you in the back, or reload as they do it to blunderbuss/pistol you in the back. Player collision needs to be a thing, it'd solve a lot of the issues this game has with combat feeling terrible. Why have a constant block? Just make it a parry...\n\nSHIP COMBAT: The second issue is that, in ship combat, people will usually do anything BUT fight with cannons. Usually people do two things, which is they opt to use a bunch of these silly specialty cannonballs that disable steering, force anchor drops, disable guns, disable barrels from being accessed (so you cant repair), put you to sleep, etc.. It goes on. (Those balls should be PVE only, and used less by skelly ships, because the ability to spam those on players makes ship combat a bit of a joke when a Brig can lock your guns down, permanently, because they went around and collected a bunch of \"Peace\" balls.) It's that, or people will often just not even fight. Instead they launch themselves from their cannon to your ship (bit of a dumb mechanic as well, it should leave you half dead and crippled for balance) and firebomb the whole deck, or they just swim under you with bomb barrels and cause so much damage its impossible to not be sunk unless you have two or more crew mates. Unless you're a 2+ crew on a mid or large sized ship, you simply cant defend against it. The smallest ship basically just insta-sinks when one of those goes off under the deck. Or they put one down below, one up top, wreck the mast and steering wheel and then if you fight, it sinks. You repair, they kill you as you try and it sinks. The small ship is just too weak to the bomb barrels. This is, again, well more apparent when you're playing solo, digging up a chest, and cant be at your ship to even defend it, let alone see the person coming. Then your whole ship is gone, treasures gone, quest maps are gone, and all they had to do was drop on barrel in the bottom deck. Not fun. Sure, you can shoot the barrel as they carry it, but again, im not at the ship. Im following my maps...\n\nCHEATING: The third issue is hackers. Given the age of the game its kind of surprising, the lack of ability to actually report someone (that I've seen). I had some 16 year old following me around, flying to my ship and spawning/dropping bomb barrels at my location with less than a second on the timer left and you literally, cannot defend against it. They fly over head, drop them, you get blasted. If you arent on a bigger ship, you're just done. I tried to leave and find a new game, same server. I literally cannot play the game when that happened from the barrel hacker. Then they just sit on the beach as my ship is sinking with me in it in voip spamming \"hahah you're bad\" while their voice cracks and they laugh about sinking you using barrel hacks. Super fun. Oh, report the dude? Can't, there's no way to see other crews unless you spyglass them, but they just fly away before I can get a name. Its pretty rare, but it happens. Super fun.\n\nPVP: PVP, while being a draw to the game, is also a factor that costs this game MOST of the new players it gets. As of now, you get sunk, and you spawn nearby and can be attacked endlessly. If there is a cheater, they can bully you endlessly. Currently PVPers can come at you, just trying to enjoy the narrative content of the game, and steamroll you endlessly while risking NOTHING at all and stealing quest items they cant even sell. You know what would fix these issues in a heartbeat though? PVE only servers. Another thing that would fix it? Your ship sinks, and you go to a new server. I hear that may become a thing, but right now? Nah. A third fix? 2 servers, PVP double rewards, PVE normal. Fix four? PVE servers that make you use a different pirate than PVP servers so you can do casual stuff in PVE and trick the PVE pirate out, and have a PVP pirate and do stufff there to trick them out on a PVP server. So you can do both depending on what you wanna do at that time. PVP purists dont like that though, they claim that it would make the game worse or kill it, but it wouldn't. THEY do. All it would do is force them to do more than grief people, because it would require they need to be face people who know how to PVP/Arent new, and they want easy loot so they cry about people just wanting to enjoy the game. PVP should be end game, not THEE game in its entirety. \n\nGREIFING: The game, for PVP, is (at least 75% of the time) people greifing you while they spam slurs/insults at you in voice chat. You spawn on your ship to fire in the spawn spot and being shot. You scuttle the ship and try to move on, but it spawns you 2 minutes away, so they rush over and sink you for literally nothing then complain when you dont interact with them. Its not a fun game because the older players make it unfun. \n\nI cant recommend it to casuals being that its very unfriendly to new players with the odd mechanics for combat, ship fights, bad PVP/PVE balance. I just cant say it doesn't make the game somewhat unplayable, because it does. I know a bunch of people who abuse said mechanics/Grief are just going to say \"get good\" or whine about suggesting they should be gone or nerfed, but that's the truth. If you dont like gimmicks in your games that make the interesting parts worse, this game probably aint for you. If you can handle that its not balanced and the current player base tries to make new players quit, and cheaters that can ruin a lobby sometimes, then hit this game up. Its still fun, just annoying when it all happens, and it happens a lot. If they fix the silly mechanics, and bad PVPVE balance, I'll for sure swap my review but yeah those are just not fun parts of the game, and they REALLY NEED a way to report cheaters and toxic players easily.", "timestamp_created": 1670756112, "timestamp_updated": 1683254128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 518, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757358908653259277", "comment_count": 47, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142790044": {"recommendationid": "142790044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199350469074", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8696, "last_played": 1691965609}, "language": "english", "review": "I found the one piece in this game", "timestamp_created": 1690314727, "timestamp_updated": 1690314727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754770636558532715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139463323": {"recommendationid": "139463323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111083016", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 7861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5434, "last_played": 1691767903}, "language": "english", "review": "water", "timestamp_created": 1685774410, "timestamp_updated": 1685774410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 127, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75392991304397583", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137526414": {"recommendationid": "137526414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952140559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8172, "last_played": 1690917861}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

While I agree that a pirate game needs ship battles, jolly social interactions with your fellow crew or random strangers, and awesome fights for loot you just uncovered on a remote island, I pretty much hate the sweaty PVP aspects. \nNPC enemies would just do fine. There ARE enemy NPC ships and hostile foes in the open world that aren't real people sweating to kill you over and over again. These NPCs are a fun challange and there is a vast variety of them sailing the ocean.\n\nImagine you just finished a voyage that took you and your pal more than an hour to complete. you just wanna sell all your stuff at an outpost to get those juicy coins to get more fashionable clothing and ship customisations, just for a random ship, that just joined the world a few minutes ago, to hunt you down, slaughter your whole crew and sell your hard earned valuables.\n\nThe sweaty PVP aspects are also a reason why I refuse recommending this game especially to older folks that are 40+ due to the game being extremly hostile towards new players. There isn't an \"easy mode\" where you get matched with new players like yourself. You'll get thrown into the same game the 4000 hour Tryhard is currently playing on.\n\nIt isn't fun, enjoyable, nor relaxing. it's just frustrating.\n\nBut you do you if you are looking for this kinda PVP in a game, you little masochist.", "timestamp_created": 1682171056, "timestamp_updated": 1682171056, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722344279289245605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138792352": {"recommendationid": "138792352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208317419", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 13813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13748, "last_played": 1685920264}, "language": "english", "review": "I have around 1000+ hours on Xbox Live prior to cancelling my subscription and getting this game on Steam, so here's my review.\n\nSea of Thieves offers a visually stunning game play experience with its beautiful and vibrant world. The game's picturesque environments, from sun-drenched beaches to treacherous storms at sea, provide a visually immersive and captivating setting. Additionally, Sea of Thieves excels in providing engaging quests and dynamic events that keep players on their toes. Whether it's embarking on treasure hunts, fending off skeletons, or unraveling intriguing mysteries, the game offers a variety of activities that can be truly enjoyable.\n\nHowever, one aspect where Sea of Thieves falters is in its PvP model. While the game allows for player-versus-player encounters, these interactions often devolve into mindless attempts to board ships rather than engaging in strategic ship battles. This lack of depth in the PvP mechanics can lead to repetitive and less satisfying gameplay experiences. It would benefit from more nuanced combat mechanics and a greater emphasis on tactical decision-making during ship-to-ship encounters.\n\nSea of Thieves suffers from a glaring lack of progression. The game fails to provide a satisfying sense of growth or accomplishment for players. Without a robust progression system, there is little incentive to continue playing and investing time in the game. The absence of meaningful rewards for completing quests or taking part in activities diminishes the overall motivation to explore and engage with the world.\n\nAnother major letdown is the in-game currency, which is rendered essentially worthless. The accumulation of gold in Sea of Thieves serves little purpose beyond cosmetic purchases, and even those options are limited in variety. The lack of meaningful economic game play mechanics leaves players feeling unfulfilled and underwhelmed, as their efforts to amass wealth in the game hold little value or significance.\n\nIn conclusion, Sea of Thieves features beautiful game play, engaging quests, and dynamic events that make for an immersive pirate adventure. However, improvements are needed in its PvP model to move beyond mindless ship boarding and focus on more strategic ship battles. Additionally, enhancing the progression system and providing more valuable uses for in-game currency would further enrich the game play experience and provide players with a greater sense of accomplishment and purpose.", "timestamp_created": 1684789845, "timestamp_updated": 1684790526, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721993327140808105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147372501": {"recommendationid": "147372501", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124414938", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1156, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1696462213}, "language": "english", "review": "Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say I'm gay\n", "timestamp_created": 1696094370, "timestamp_updated": 1696094370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701552510261535645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134021003": {"recommendationid": "134021003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219660999", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1693854398}, "language": "english", "review": "Water is looking phenomenal\nGraphics are gorgeous \nAtmosphere is cozy and immersive\nCombat is interesting\nBattles are epic\nOne of the best to chill with friends\nNo other game like this\nHaven't experienced it is a loss", "timestamp_created": 1677905253, "timestamp_updated": 1677905253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.719463467597961426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128637843": {"recommendationid": "128637843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976121658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 84217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2812, "playtime_at_review": 1420, "last_played": 1696543513}, "language": "english", "review": "Sail with friends or strangers, invade another ship, and become pirate king.

Or if you are playing with competent friends and decide to ruin it for others. Did both, can confirm it is indeed fun to sink someone after a hard fought battle and also to just chill and do PvE for a day.\n\nThat being said, the developers are really, really stubborn, in a bad way. They insist that the game is supposed to be this grand adventure where player interaction is king and therefore the PvPvE aspect is integral to the experience while the majority of the playerbase, which is casual, says it isn't. There was a PvP mode called Arena in the past so all your sweaty PvP needs could be met without ruining some poor dad and sons weekend play session. They removed that because the demand was not nearly high enough to warrant the servers. Instead of drawing the conclusion that \"that must mean most people simply do not want PvP forced onto them\" they just removed the mode and forced all the PvPers back in the standard PvPvE server. So now nobody is happy.\nIf you want to just PvP now, tough luck. If you just want to PvE, tough luck.\nIf you had a tough day this game will not allow you to relax with PvE and friends. If you want the action loaded PvP this game will not allow that, unless you get lucky and find a willing target on the pretty huge map quickly. It is in this weird middle ground where really nobody is happy sadly and I am certain this will not change. Rare has said so, so often that they view this as integral and refuse to add PvE servers or even just simple level based matchmaking. There is an audience for this type of PvPvE game, but them marketing it as this fun, light-hearted and make your own story type of game is misleading. \nEspecially, with how winning the battle against your attackers will not even save you entirely. They probably had no loot themselves so you got nothing out of this. They just respawn with a new ship and try to get to you again as fast as possible while you still have all your hard earned loot to lose.\n\nI really love most aspects of this game, but the fact that it forces it's PvP system, where spawn camping is the actual meta strategy to sink enemies onto every player, every time you play does sour it too much to recommend. You can play for hours and lose all your loot to some dude who you really had no chance against since he had three friends with him who all played 1000+ hours and you were playing with just one friend who is a casual player. \n\n\nLittle additions for the interested readers:\n\n\nThe community\nMy god the community. I have been called slurs and other things many times, either for playing too well of playing too bad. People will get sooo angry with you for choosing to run from a fight when you have four hours of loot to lose while the attackers have nothing on board to loot. People will get angry for chasing them when you have no loot and want theirs. This community can be the nicest, chillest people ever, if you are lucky. Most of the time though this game just attracts the people who enjoy ruining your day in any way, since that is what the game enables with its design. The people who want to have a good time with others simply get pushed out over time by all the toxicity and you can see this shift that is taking place where with every season and expansion there is a bunch of new, friendly players who quickly die out after one too many bad sinks.\n\n\nThe PvP Experience\nTo sink an enemy ship you MUST board it. Unless you have double the crew or your oponent has close to no supplies they will always be able to simply repair their damage and bail out the water faster than you can put holes into their ship.  Same goes for you. So the actual ship to ship combat is honestly secondary to the on-ship boarding combat. If you are good enough simply putting a single hole into the enemies ship and spawnkilling them over and over while their ship fills up is the best strategy for a quick sink. This means spawnkilling, an act reviled in other games, is necessary to an extent to win a battle in this one. Also due to this the PvP is obviously heavily favored towards larger crews since, even if they miss most of their shots, them just killing you once will mean they can put one hole in your ship and every time you respawn you will now have to kill two or more people at the same time to be able to repair. Rare is seemingly trying to make this better, they disabled ally revives on enemy ships some time ago and you can respawn at multiple different locations on your ship to make it harder for people to completely spawncamp you. The core issue still persists obviously. They only way I can think off to make the ship-to-ship combat a more important part of sinking someone is to either decrease how effective the bucket is or to increase the rate at which the ships fill up so you have a better chance to actually overwhelm the enemy crew with so many holes they simply cannot keep up with repairs. Right now, unless you have a similar sized or smaller  crew in your broadside for a LONG time who really just doesn't play well it is impossible to sink with purely naval combat.\nAll in all, the PvP is heavily unbalanced, has a high skill ceiling (which is obviously a good thing, don't misunderstand) and is only really fun when fighting a crew of similar size and skill, unless you are some sort of or masochist or sadist. Instead of these cool cinematic cannon-firing naval battles it's just boarding attempt after boarding attempt after boarding attempt with some cannon fire sprinkled in. Matchmaking and servers for solo, duo, trio and quad crews specifically would solve they crew size and skill imbalance easily, but this will never happen with Rare. \n\nI want to give Rare some credit where it is due, they are trying to make things better. They made it so the solo and duo ship masts specifically is harder to break, as said, they disabled ally revives on enemy ships to make the spawn camping a little better and I am sure they will continue to do their best. Still, with their current philosophy of swearing by this PvPvE, very open model this game will never be the adventure many people know it could be.\n\nOh, and Hit Registration is still a huge issue, has been for years, so do not count on your shots hitting to actually deal damage in a game where that can mean losing hours of progress :)", "timestamp_created": 1682533407, "timestamp_updated": 1683900782, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70615619421005249", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125777374": {"recommendationid": "125777374", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063119030", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2920, "last_played": 1693586101}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitive pirate game, that's it, in a pirate mood its this or assassins creed blackflag and EA botched availability so this. 9/10 great fun but if you don't have anyone to play with you will get burnt out very quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1668892696, "timestamp_updated": 1668892696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704942703247070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129041263": {"recommendationid": "129041263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063115829", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 11618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9510, "last_played": 1684273332}, "language": "english", "review": "if you have friends, buy this game.\nive had an incredible amount of fun with this and will continue to do so without a doubt\n\n(can be played alone but everything is more fun and easier with friends!)", "timestamp_created": 1671736474, "timestamp_updated": 1673274918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704508125782012939", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135244193": {"recommendationid": "135244193", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031275480", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1576, "last_played": 1693424568}, "language": "english", "review": "add sex", "timestamp_created": 1679589428, "timestamp_updated": 1679589428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 313, "votes_funny": 101, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704080402851104736", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125687127": {"recommendationid": "125687127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327629049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4132, "last_played": 1673320033}, "language": "english", "review": "Just give us the option to disable PVP already, we just want to play in peace with friends and enjoy the co-op experience. \"Just git gud\"? how?

When I sailed with friends, we usually had a good time sailing anywhere, trying different quests, and making a nice amount of gold. When I sailed alone, it was very relaxing and enjoyable to hunt, fish, or just hangout on my favorite island. There were players of every type, rude, polite, quiet, new, old, it was a mixed bag. I could handle, accept, and enjoy anything that was in the game. \n\nAs the seasons changed and new content arrived, the tone of the game was changing. My friends and I could feel it. We had done hundreds of quests, fought many AI, raided strongholds, we did everything we could. We began to realize that many of the quest types were too similar. Go and fetch this item, fight these enemies, and deal with a skeleton ship every now and then. We had overplayed many of the quests, new and old, and had bored ourselves with the repetition. \n\nWhen new content arrived we were all excited and tried many of them. The ghost ship fleets, Flameheart, ashen winds, any of the adventures again and again. They never felt fun or challenging, they were just a big time commitment. Most of the new events we only tried once because we would still feel bored a week after we did it. The last thing we all did together was the first pirates life adventure. It was at least an hour of gameplay, and we left it feeling bored, exhausted, and annoyed. When the adventure was over and we couldn't walk on our ship because we would phase through the floorboards, we furiously uninstalled and left. \n\nMonths later, I felt the itch to play again because it still had a place in my heart. There were so many good times had by myself or with friends, and I had to give it another chance. It was hurtful to see that Sea of Thieves was walking the same path as Rainbow Six Siege, Warframe, Payday 2, and some of my other once beloved games. An overabundance of content with varying levels of quality, trying its best to keep you playing the game by adding \"new\" content. I sailed back to my favorite island and took a good look at how things had changed. Many of the items I wanted to purchase with gold were absurdly expensive, yet they were barely a recolor of something I already owned. Plunder passes filled with interesting items that I wasn't going to spend over a month grinding for. The items of the first plunder pass had still not been added to the store, despite reading that they would be over a year ago. New quests and events that were still, in essence, the same as events we had when I first played the game in 2020. I knew Sea of Thieves was lost and that day, I lost my love for it.\n\nWhen The captaincy update came along, I told my old friends and we gathered to take a look and see what the game was still turning into. When I found out I couldn't use the word \"drunk\" in my ship's name, it put a bad taste in all of our mouths. We looked through all the ship cosmetics and their requirements, and we weren't about to make that much of a commitment to one game that we didn't love anymore. We uninstalled once again, and now they try not to think about what horrid, familiar, and expensive shapes this game will take next.\n\nWhile they continue to frown, grumble, and curse what this game has become and how it didn't deliver what exactly what they wanted, I reminisce on the wonderful times that this game delivered to me. All the fish I caught, the outfits I made, the islands with beauty I admired, the gentle and sweet people I met, and the great battles with skeletons or strangers on the sea. I once loved every moment of it and it had earned a special place in my games library and my heart.\n\nI won't forget what this game has given to me, especially now that it gives nothing to me now. It will continue down the path of content with commitment, and I can't dedicate my time to a game that asks for so much of it. I may reinstall in the coming years, return to my island to reminisce once again, help a new friend complete an adventure, but my love for this game is gone, it sails to new lands.", "timestamp_created": 1675801575, "timestamp_updated": 1676825139, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694027900695800781", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132414700": {"recommendationid": "132414700", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978781795", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1683144855}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who prefers a solo or coop experience, it was not made clear to me that the other crews mentioned within the game's description were other players who will seek to keep you from completing a single voyage.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I know that may seem perhaps dishonest coming from someone with 257 hours on the game, however I can assure you that it is not. Sea of Thieves certainly has its moments and it can be fun completing quests and sinking ships. Although I acknowledge this fact, the majority of a player\u2019s time in Sea of Thieves will be spent either gathering resources, sailing(which gets really boring after a while), lost on some quest, or in \u201ccombat\u201d.\n\n Although the first three tasks are clearly either boring or annoying, the fourth task(combat) surely should make up for it, right? Ship combat is pretty fun if you have friends who know what they are doing. If you have incompetent friends, you will have a bad time against sweaty players. If you do not have anyone to play with, you can play solo, but it sucks to play against multiple players solo unless you are extremely experienced. With a competent crew, ship combat can be fun if your opponent wants to fight you. \n\n[sidenote]\nActual gun and sword combat in this game sucks due to sweats, server lag, the distance that ships usually are from each other, spawn camping, and HITREG which is very bad in this game.\n\nAt the end of my last part about combat, I stated \u201cship combat can be fun if your opponent wants to fight you\u201d. Players in this game tend to run from combat very frequently, and personally I can\u2019t blame them. Sinking in this game reset all of resources on your ship such as food, wood, and cannonballs which take time to regain. The game practically incentivizes you to run away which isn\u2019t fun for either player.\n\nOverall, Sea of Thieves can be fun under the right circumstances, but because of the way the game incentivizes running from combat and the tedious actions that the player must take to be effective, the game is not fun. Also when I first tried to play the game on a laptop, the load times could take up to 30min to load into a server, and half the time I would get kicked for being afk before I even loaded in.", "timestamp_created": 1668746390, "timestamp_updated": 1668746390, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68493276834487915", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134960064": {"recommendationid": "134960064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979468432", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1696019461}, "language": "english", "review": "Do what you want, 'cause a pirate is free, You are a pirate!\n\nYar har, fiddle di dee, Being a pirate is all right with me, Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free, You are a pirate!

[b] All major positives can easily be found in other reviews so ill focus on what makes this game unbearable to play. [/b]\n\n1. PVP.\nSadly the skill ceiling for SOT is so high that all new players will grow to hate online interactions. I've sank my fair share of ships and rightfully got away with it. Unfortunately I haven't seen a \"New\" player for almost 3 months. All PVP interactions will be against sweaty players with great aim.\n\n2. Cheats.\nThis game doesn't seem to have an Anticheat. Most players do not use god mode or speed hacks. Its mostly ESP and Aimbot (or Autofire scripts)\n\n3. Time investment.\nIt takes around an hour to turn any kind loot into gold. I enjoy this kind of time investment, that being said its hard to enjoy the game when 45 min of progress is immediately erased by a streamer who is server hopping for content. (Speaking from experience on this one)\n\n4. The community.\nIf you sink- \"Git Good trash\"\nIf you sink them - \"you are a Hacker/ Hit Reg Issues\"\n\n5. Lack of punishment for toxic behavior.\nI've been called every slur in the book by a 14 year old who probably doesn't even know what a slur is. While i'm not offended or bothered by it I don't think its appropriate for most kids to be around. Reporting a player in sea of thieves requires you to sign up on SOT website and submit video proof to get someone reprimanded. I don't have the patience for that, nor should I be responsible for moderating other players.\n\nUpdate 7/23/2023: I'm no longer playing Sea Of Thieves due to the lack of punishment for toxic activity. On 7/09/2023 I was harassed by a few players so i went ahead and filled out a report. In addition I let Sea of thieves moderation know that if nothing was done I would add the information in the report to my review. After a day or so of harassment I learned that the aforementioned user was only banned for a few days.... So here's the video of my encounter with him.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/5wT5eB2SB6g\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/mEadMcbZjfM\n\n6. Game modes\nYou really only have 1 option..... PVPVE\n\nI believe it takes anywhere between 3 and 5 positive interactions to offset 1 negative experience. This game is probably 2 positives for every 1 negative \n\nExceptions can be found for almost all of the things listed above. \n....But honestly, why listen to the exceptions?", "timestamp_created": 1680327814, "timestamp_updated": 1690161268, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674062609672546387", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146436293": {"recommendationid": "146436293", "author": {"steamid": "76561199454113136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 23894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2025, "playtime_at_review": 21666, "last_played": 1696147806}, "language": "english", "review": "So I know I've said I don't recommend this game. That's kind of a lie. I love this game for what it can be at times. I have played for a little over 350 hours. Which is nothing if you want to be good at the game.  I think this game is awesome at times and is amazing to play with friends, but I can't bring myself to recommend this game.\n\nRare does not listen to it's community and the game can be very janky. Hackers have become more frequent by the week, and there no third party software detection. As I continue to play it I lose more and more of what used to make it fun. \n\nI recommend this game to people who want to be a pirate for 100-200 hours. It is a great game and very pretty. \n\nHowever it is a game that is continuing to go in the wrong direction and keeps getting increasingly frustrating to play as rare's servers are pretty bad, rare does not listen to it's community, and rare continues to ignore the hacking problem and pretend it is not as big of a deal as it is. \n\nTo exemplify how bad the hacking is this is a triple A game, the only Triple A game I know about (besides GTA) that has speed hacks, teleportation hacks, aim bot, the ability to spawn items, flying ships, basically all the hacking under the sun. \nRare seems to have no intention of fixing this soon. Basically fun game, nice to play with friends, but has a company backing it that seems to really not care.", "timestamp_created": 1694909448, "timestamp_updated": 1694909448, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66920846700668335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125641691": {"recommendationid": "125641691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319118398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 28230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25991, "last_played": 1669208076}, "language": "english", "review": "Want a game where you can spend lots of hours unlocking skins only to have them vanish? \nThis is the game for you!\nWant a game where hackers roam free, sinking your ships, stealing your gold and killing you without being able to harm them?\nThis is the game for you!\nWant a game where when there is a problem the support ignores you?\nThis is the game for you!", "timestamp_created": 1668709328, "timestamp_updated": 1668709328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666954398155212402", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136061079": {"recommendationid": "136061079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848296790", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "playtime_at_review": 1320, "last_played": 1695415453}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a cat here.

They want someone who's unprepared. They want an unfair fight. They want to fight someone who doesn't consent to the competition. Again, I used to hate the players, but that's humanity.

We're here to enjoy each other's company, and some pushy loot-fixated strangers were not exactly improving the mood. We figured they'd eventually get bored and go away.

The promo video highlights the open world, the exploration, the seafaring, the quests, the loot, with a nod to combat (and using video clips from PvE combat).

The game basically sets up new players to fail, sets you up as effectively the NPC for the \"whales\" (the players with 500+ hours, spending hundreds on microtransactions, who tell you to git gud after taking you on a 3v1 fight for the incredible bounty of two (2) empty chicken coops) to fight.", "timestamp_created": 1679115948, "timestamp_updated": 1679118335, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615316271781921387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146940445": {"recommendationid": "146940445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058933673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 308, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1695518998}, "language": "english", "review": "While I get what they were going for now... I was very taken aback by the session-based nature of the game, where every time you logout or disconnect, all progress is lost except for currencies, cosmetics, titles... This is a natural function of the game, just not one I have seen and I am not fond of it. I could adjust to this, but the game does not lend itself to easily pickup, play, pause, get a coffee, come back in 10 min, and do another 20-40 min.

The community was very rude towards them. I would not see such behavior\\people attracted to another game, such as a deep-rock-galactic. There is something about this game, perhaps it's pvp nature, that seems to attract a negativity.\n\nThe art style is phenomenal. Hands down, one of the best I have ever seen. The only hiccup is the look of the characters in certain screens, where they are standing strangely, like they are dancing on their toes in constipation.\n\nYou cannot see in front of your ship, because they put the sails directly in front of your view, very low, and that is incredibly frustrating - sails should be higher up so you can see.\n\nI wish that the fishing part of this game was refined just a bit more, then separated with 1 or 2 more continuous game loops on a peaceful server and more seaports.\n\nI wish that collected items that I find, I actually kept, and that they had more utility than to simply sell or hand-in for gold and rep.\n\nThe games tutorial does not explain much and it does not explain well. While I have the fortune of having played enough games to ease right into it. The game says it \"Recommends\" you do the tutorial, but then it forces you to do it anyway. \n\nWhile the game has improved with numerous updates over many years, reports from my favorite YouTube reviewers of it's initial release state was somewhat inexcusable. \"Worth A Buy\" is my guy.\n\nEach time you start the game, you must watch the advertisement of their latest Monkey update, or you must click through the advertisement...\n\nEach time you click play, you must fill out a gameplay session form of questions about how it is you want to play, every time. There is no way to pickup were you left off. You must start over again and you must complete the survey.\n\nEach time you play, you start at a random location on the map.\n\nThere are no character creation tools.

This game is outstandingly fun, beautiful and interesting for first 100-200 hours you may probably spent. \nSHOULD YOU PLAY IT FOR MORE THAN 200 HOURS? - PROBABLY NOT. Reason being the fact, that you'll slowly start seeing, that this game is actually awfully copying mechanics of it's own,and that it's same in everything and technically broken. And Dev's doesn't really seem to be caring\\doing something about it.\nPros:\nMUSIC - every time you hear it, you just fully get into song's atmosphere and overall mood. It's plain magnificent;\nGRAPHICS - this game... is just godly-like with it's graphics;\nSTORY MODE (Pirate's Life Tall Tales) - comparing to usual TT's, they are awesome, they aren't as much time consuming as their old brother, they also have easier achievements and they ARE MUCH MORE interesting, as almost all of their missions are different, besides one theme of Davy Jones already can be a reason to try it out;\nEMOTIONS - if you are playing with friends, than holy cow, you'll get alot of great emotions from your first hours.\nCons:\nBUGS - i guess, i don't need to say here, you'll meet them, not as often as cheaters rn, but still;\nHACKERS - a lot of them, and Rare doesn't seem to really care about it;\nHIT-REG PROBLEM - \"skill issue\" - no, my friend, sadly, it's not. Many people including me encountered this abomination a lot of times, when you simply shoot a guy, and he just doesn't seem to get hurt at all. And sometimes this may lead to a fail for your side, even tho, you tried your best;\nBORING, REPETITIVE CONTENT - what can i say, it says it's all really. Gold cosmetics ain't getting updated that much nowadays, even if they do - it's most-likely a simple recolour. Missions are just getting used to after 200 hours, as they all repetitive and have no difference, almost, at all, Athena's missions delay this feeling for a bit, but not for that much time. Bosses, doesn't matter if it's a boss from Story mode (original Tall Tales) or from Fort... or from Ashen winds... they all have one problem - they all are just reskin of one boss: they all have same abilities (ashen winds bosses have at least a bit of their of own, thanks for that, at least). Besides, game just seems to be awfully casual, like for a 6 y.o. kids, as killing bosses just as easy as taking a small candy from a child... who is giving to you. There is so much potential for fractions and events to develop into, but Rare just doesn't use it (same bosses, Hunter's Call being forgotten, athena doesn't feeling just as great as it is on your way to Pirate Legend title, Arena being forgotten and deleted in 2022);\nCOMMUNITY - you'll meet either really friendly and fantastic people, or you'll meet boring guys, or even worse, an absolute toxics. Thus the reason being, it's better to play with friends, or solo;\nPIRATE EMPORIUM -  that's whole another topic: if you are giving your money to buy something great in a game about PIRATES, why do developers add stuff like fish-king? Or a plant-costume? Or an Undead, dangit, Gladiator? Why one of the best Pirate-Themed sets were added either a really long time ago, or with a Pirate's Life (Pirate's of the Caribbean) update? Does Dev's nowadays really don't have fantasy at all? Those sets are great, they look cool, but they don't belong in a game about PIRATES, for god's sake. There is still really brilliantly themed sets, which look aesthetically right, but i don't remember new sets being just as correct as some of the old ones;\nGRIND - OOOOH YEA BABY, THIS GAME IS ALL ABOUT GRIND, THIS GAME IS BASICALLY BUILD OFF OF IT. And, unfortunately, it's one of the biggest reasons you WILL, for sure, get tired of it. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCONCLUSION: \nAt the end of the day, you should definitely try this game out, it's still really superb for some hours, but when you start feeling strange Deja Vu in it - get out, do not let it consume you like it did to me. (out of my 1000 hours only about 300 of them is what i really want to feel again). For the first 100 hours, you just see this colossal world, filled with joy, adventures and epicness. It's just like you opened a whole new universe. And it's really worth it, it will be great memories. Sadly, it will be left as a memories after some time, as you'll get tired of this game. I won't recommend it, it's just now that i saw all of the monstrosities of the game that i can't possibly recommend it... that is, if there wouldn't be one IF:\nIF YOU WANNA SEE THIS GAME AS A LONG-TIME PROJECT - No, i do not recommend it, and i categorically against this game being viewed as such piece of product. \nON THE OTHER HAND - if you wanna play a game for 100-200 hours, or even less - go ahead, it's worth it, but do not forget to take friends with you on this journey.", "timestamp_created": 1678034271, "timestamp_updated": 1678034271, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611487686634063721", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147245974": {"recommendationid": "147245974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185029610", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2087, "playtime_at_review": 5409, "last_played": 1696348027}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the time when I can loot the islands, do the quests and sell what I have found.

The biggest problem with this game is feeling like your time is fundamentally being disrespected every minute that you play this game. This is not a game that you can sit down and play for an hour and feel like you accomplished anything at all. The only way to play this game effectively is to have a group of friends on voice coms dedicate an entire day to grinding out a specific faction reputation. The problem is that it takes time to rank up your ability to earn xp in that play session. The other problem is that when you actually find fun content and park your ship to check it out there is a good chance you'll get back to your ship only to find its been burned down and you've lost all of your progression. Its a beautiful game but honestly just a toxic mess of failure and quit moments. The best thing is that all of it is for nothing. The rewards for playing this game are 100% cosmetic and have no value or power attached to them. You are essentially just pursuing the achievement of maxing out all of your faction numbers and pirate level which have zero impact on your gameplay experience. This is a great game to play if you have an entire day to kill with your friends.

That's fine. That's great. I love competitive games.\n\nThe issue is that every single mechanic in the game seems to be decided on by people who have never played a competitive game. The culmination of the 800,000 baffling design decisions end up in a PvP game where you'll have an enjoyable fight about 2% of the time. The rest of the 'PvP' is either getting ganked while you're selling loot and unable to defend yourself, or you doing that to someone else. If the planets align and you get a fun ship on ship battle, it's a great time... until you realize that your enemies will respawn with a new ship in a port a stone's throw away from you and be able to come right after you again... and again... and again... until they run you out of supplies like cannonballs to shoot at them or wood to repair your ship. Effectively they win, and get the loot by losing, over and over and over. You can't actually escape, because they are just as fast as you, and as soon as you go into a port, you're an easy target. There's a way to avoid it, but it involves sacrificing all your loot and using an exploit to hop to a different server. Fun.\n\nThe way you win against ships that are otherwise invincible if properly maintained in a fight is spawn camping. You have to be able to stop people from repairing their ship, and that's the way to do it. Yeah, that thing that everyone hates in FPS games. It's not an unintended consequence. It's a feature. This means being on the losing end of a fight is just getting spawn camped over and over and over instead of anyone actually being forced to play the video game.\n\nIf the thought of playing 'Fortnite' on a boat with a bunch of toxic 12 year olds encouraged to be toxic by the game's terrible design choices doesn't put you off, then maybe the lack of care put into progression, quest design or the sailing  model will. The sailing model is an absurd thing where some ships sail fastest in a headwind by just squaring up their sails. No ships handle meaningfully differently, with larger ships basically just serving as a handicap to larger groups via a decreasingly ergonomic layout and having it take longer to do various things like raise the anchor or move booms. The only notable difference is a slight, maybe 2-5% increase in speed that certain ships have against certain others at specific points of sail.\n\nAs for progression... There is none, that is except extreme late game sails that give you an unfair advantage in a fight. Besides that all changes you can make are cosmetic, with no weapons or ship modifications that can effect gameplay. You will probably reach 'Legendary Pirate' in about a week of regular play if you know how to best exploit each of the game's faction's 'emissary' gameplay. Meanwhile there are beginner's trap quests that will have you puttering around for hours for only a handful of gold pieces, rather than literal hundreds of thousands you can get in the same amount of time for doing different quests.\n\nIf you want PvE? There is none. The PvE that exists is all insultingly easy, to the point where anyone wanting a challenge should be doing PvP instead-- of course that brings me around to the beginning, where PvP is atrocious, toxic garbage instead of being fun fights. The ultimate irony is that the developers put in a new PvP mode, expecting it to draw in PvP players and decrease ganking... Naturally the kind of players who are interested in a game where the PvP consists of ganks and spawn camping were uninterested in fair fights, so they either ignore it altogether or use an exploit to jump a would-be PvP opponent in a 5v1 gank... Or they camp the edge of the map, with their strategy consisting of forcing the other ship out... again instead of just having a fun fight. I'm not sure what the developers expected given the sort of people who enjoy PvP as it exists in the game already.", "timestamp_created": 1670390179, "timestamp_updated": 1670390179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568862259387969971", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137095967": {"recommendationid": "137095967", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997306951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 12810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5050, "last_played": 1694998068}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: 04/24/2023\nBUYER BEWARE!!!!\n\nTried to give this game one more go, Ran into a hacker that sunk our ship while we were fighting multiple skele ships(NPC).

MMO's 20 years ago figured out how and why this approach doesn't work and only benefits the most aggressive and oppressive part of the community, yet as with every other aspect of the game that's needed changing over the years, the devs believe they know better. Adding PvE servers wouldn't result in dead servers as some defenders would imply, it'd give a space for people that otherwise just wouldn't play, and a more positive experience for those who are starved enough for a decent piracy game made in the last 10 years to get into a PvP environment despite not having any interest in the PvP content. If you force PvE players into PvP all you're doing is giving easy pickings to people who like PvP, it's not engaging for the PvPer, doesn't test their skills and it's a negative experience for the PvE player. The only reason a PvP player would want PvE players in their very limited servers is to bully people, or an alternative option if they're too unskilled to engage with anyone actually interested in PvP. It benefits only the least admirable part of the community and I don't understand why the slur spewing toxic part of the community needs a leg up. Why do PvE players have to pay the price for the enjoyment of a volatile subsection of PvP players? It's a bizarre choice when on the other hand they'll censor words as benign as \"hangman\". Brief side mention that the game is designed to be aggressive to solo players, the only way to really play on your own is to be avoidant or prey on other solo players, anything else and you are violently outclassed by design.\n\nThat aside the game has been out for years yet still has routine bugs that go from obnoxious to game breaking, be it crashing, old accounts having consistently more issues so loyal early adopters are punished for believing in the team, textures refusing to load at all, flying ships, unkillable krakens, texture breaking in story mode, physics launching your ship into the sky for parking too close to a dock, and more I'm sure I forgot. The monetization is cosmetic but as there's hardly any goal in game beyond cosmetics you can say that short of pay to win the game is 100% monetized and aggressively so, enjoy paying between 15-20 bucks for one decent ship design, which isn't impossible to get ingame but it relies on waiting on islands for hours to have a chance at getting the equivalent of maybe a dollar's worth of premium currency IF you catch it in time.\n\nThis is a game that has solely survived on the hopes and dreams of millions desperate for a good game about piracy which as a theme have ironically been a desert, with the rare oasis and no consistency in genre.\nA hole they fill marginally for the time, though with luck not for much longer.

The biggest thing to know about this game is the kind of experience that awaits you.\n\nSea of Thieves is a beautiful open sandbox PvP game.  The game is in no way a PvE adventure with a little PvP.  It perhaps sounds funny to point this out, but most of the marketing surrounding the game promotes added PvE features and mostly overlooks the sandbox PvP elements that make up the core of this game.  One can be romanticized with a sea of treasure-filled adventure and forget that over the horizon there are always other crews out there itching for a fight.\n\nThere's an old saying on the Sea of Thieves:  your loot is not yours until you turn it in.  This really best defines how one should measure their expectations within Sea of Thieves.  Loot only grants access to better cosmetics for the most part, so truly any pleasure you get from this game should be measured from the experiences you create rather than how much gold you earn.  Temper your expectations that this is a PvP game and that you will lose often at the start.\n\nThe open-ended PvP nature of this game can be a collection of memorable joys as well as crushing experiences.  That's really this games greatest strength:  the ability to create stories.  Both victories or losses can create tales to be shared unlike many other games out there today.  However, there are two big flaws to the game that compelled me to put it to rest personally.\n\nThe first is how the game is a poor teacher.  What do I mean by that?  Well, in Sea of Thieves its clunky combat and ship maneuvering is easy to learn but very difficult to master.  There's a lot of mechanics at work when it comes sailing, cannoning, ship boarding, and grenade throwing.  If you die and sink it can take up to ten minutes to sail back and try and meet your opponent again.   However, by the time you get there they may be long gone or the scenario can be completely different.  Ultimately, this can make it very difficult to practice or learn from your mistakes.  Depending on your skill level this means it can take dozens if not hundreds of hours of game play to get a decent grasp of the game.  This includes watching helpful guides on youtube.\n\nThe second flaw is the potential \"toxicity\" you can run into within the game.  More often than not you will run into mean spirited folk whose behavior goes beyond sportsmanlike.  It can be a real drag at times.  It's a sad reality within a game that conveys its setting as so bright and cheerful, but it is what it is.\n\nIn summary, who is this game for?  If you love PvP and the idea of an open sandbox PvP game:  this can be for you.  You will need patience, a willingness to learn from others, and a tough skin.  No one outside of your own crew can be trusted.  You will lose and you will lose often, but then eventually you will start achieving what you seek.  All in all:  make good stories along the way with your experiences.  Be a good sport when you win.  Be a great sport when you lose.   You might embrace a game that's quite special.\n\nI've put down my pirate hat for now, but maybe down the road I'll pick it up again and hope for some high adventure on the seas.", "timestamp_created": 1679006239, "timestamp_updated": 1679006239, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56511455774307251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125063460": {"recommendationid": "125063460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269334152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16960, "last_played": 1694868633}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2620\ufe0f All on the waves shall know our story \n\u2620\ufe0f Sing of the battles fought ashore       \n\u2620\ufe0f We all shall thrive on fame and glory  \n\u2620\ufe0f When we sail together", "timestamp_created": 1667760264, "timestamp_updated": 1667825116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564053773880004883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147581247": {"recommendationid": "147581247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277386338", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "playtime_at_review": 3092, "last_played": 1696373102}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always enjoyed pirate themed games and stories, it's one of my favorite aesthetics.

No Problem, right? That happens, I'll just continue on.

First, it tells a story of a game released to a mixed  reception, lacking in content but having this one very important ingredient \u2013 the solid foundation. Rare \u2013 the game's developers seized the opportunity and kept working on their title delivering the sandbox experience only a few other titles could match.\n\n\tCurrent day Sea of Thieves is overflowing with content, opening multiple different ways for players to have fun within the game. Light-hearted artstyle, solid graphics and great soundtrack enforce the pirate fantasy and the feeling of wonderous exploration.\n\n\tThis is a PvEvP title. It's designed with some tedium in mind. Players have to manually carry and sell their treasures. All of that is done on purpose as it makes players susceptible to other crews attacks. Naval battles require skill as there is no power progression within the game. For this reason some players might be deterred from the title. Loosing your hard earned loot feels infuriating at times but it sneakily hooks player into the gameplay loop. For each stressful extraction, naval battle, ship chase the feeling of finally winning against other crews and then finally being able to sell everything you managed to plunder feels addictively satisfying.\n\n\tIn Sea of Thieves no two runs are the same. The ingenious design of this title creates a perfect sandbox with tons of activities and then throws players into the mix. This is the Ultimate Storymaker as it creates the best, most memorable stories in gaming.\n\n\tI strongly recommend this game.\n\nIf you are interested in a full video review then check out my youtube channel: https://youtu.be/1f5sGPT5AxM", "timestamp_created": 1687427616, "timestamp_updated": 1687427708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138677845": {"recommendationid": "138677845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248687106", "num_games_owned": 1582, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 30186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29723, "last_played": 1694898610}, "language": "english", "review": "Very lovely and entertaining game, you will never be bored. \n\nIt is a great game up to four players but don`t worry you can play alone, with 2 or 3 more friends/randoms. Yes even if you may have friends but they don`t want to play it, or you just don`t have friends - you can play fill your crew with random player/s. \n\nThis is the perfect game for being a real pirate. You have literally everything and nothing you buy gives you p2w. \n\nSo where do I start? You can have your own pets (for money) from dogs to cats, monkey and parrots. Or even foxes. \nYou can fight against NPCs on Islands, ships or even against sharks, the megalodon or the big a$$ motherducking Kraken. They barely spawn but if they do, you better be prepared and kill them. \nOr you go for nice and chilling quests. Search for treasures and dig them out of the sand. \n\nThere also a lot of different ways to earn the ingame currency. Either you go for players and hunt them down or just straight for gold quests and swim across the oceans with your ship, killing some skeletons on different islands. Stay careful for other ships steered by real players, so they don`t shoot you down with their cannonballs and steal everything you have, before you sell it by the outpost!\n\nYou can do a lot in this game and the fun won`t leave for sure!\n\nMy conclusion to this game:\nThis game belongs to everyones library. You should defintely buy this game if you haven`t already! And don`t be sad if you have no clues about this game. Either find someone to get you along this game, ask your friends or randoms.

I remember the first moment of getting on a ship alone and sailing out. I didn't know what I was doing, and it was exhilarating. Sailing from island to island and doing the various quests is fun, and even just the sailing mechanics themselves and how they inspire a crew to work together (well... if you're solo on a sloop as I am the majority of the time). Tall Tales\u2014though apparently not many people actually do them\u2014provide a more curated experience. I think they're a bit obtuse sometimes and have to look up what to do, but they can be fun. The graphics are stunning, the amount there is to do in this game is wild, and the lore is deep.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThat said, I do not recommend this game. Far and away the things I remember the most about this game are when I've spent hours sailing from island to island trying to level up my emissary flag only to have a random brig come by while I'm not looking and sink me. Suddenly, all of my effort and real-life time have been wasted. Well, let me correct that. Not wasted. I gained a terrible experience. A casual solo sail thru the seas comes crashing to a halt and is replaced with loss, disappointment, and a reminder that people can be cruel and petty for no other reason than to achieve their own personal gain, with little to no regard for what that means to someone else.\n\nI understand that PvP is part of the appeal of the game to some, but I do not believe that this game should cater only to that. I believe that there should be PvE-only options. A way to know that if I want to pick up the game for a casual time doing some treasure hunts, I can do that without having to constantly be anxious that someone's going to come ruin my day. The fact that the biggest reward in this game is, \"I'm so happy no one came by and took my treasure,\" is not good. In motivational theory, personal satisfaction, and game design avoiding a bad outcome as your main motivator is not the only, or the healthiest, option.\n\nWhat's more, while the community isn't inherently toxic, if you even think about speaking negatively about PvP, people say \"well, just stop playing the game, then!\" shaming you for wanting to not play PvP (this has personally happened to me). Even the devs have posted in the Steam discussion boards that their stance is definitive on this, they will not accommodate PvE only. If you even post about it in the threads, they say that they will moderate closely, remove those posts, and take action against repeat \"offenders.\" It's disheartening, to me, that people can take such an exclusionary view on the world. The only way to do something is the way they want. If other people don't like it, too bad. Conversation over.\n\nThere are ways to implement PvP-only servers that do not detract from the existing PvPvE. It's like when Fortnite introduced permanent No-Build. It didn't stop people from being able to play the way they always loved, but it also opened up the door for so many other people to play a game which they wouldn't otherwise because of the prohibitive nature of its core gameplay. I find that a developer to say they will punish anyone for expressing a differing way they'd prefer to enjoy the game to be shameful and... actually as I say it, it's perfectly in line with their decision to encourage those negative interpersonal interactions in-game. That actually makes sense now.\n\nI am currently playing through the Tall Tales with my brother (and god willing we do so without having to waste the 2 hours we have to play together each week by someone coming and sinking us), but once we have finished those, I will no longer play Sea of Thieves. I will actively be recommending people do not play it. I think a game that is designed specifically and singularly to encourage selfishness and a zero-sum play style\u2014while the devs actively censor conversation around a PvE-only option to allow people who prefer other play styles enjoy their game\u2014is not a game worth giving my time and energy to.\n\n------------------------------------\n\ntl;dr - game could be and is fun, but the developer's decision to not accommodate players who wish to have a casual, cooperative-only experience makes me not want to play this game.

Lots & lots of Arrrr's, loot, gold, swashbuckling, battles, boats, swords, guns, cannons firing, and mayhem! But also sea shanties, grog drinking, relaxing & fishing, sailing, swimming, treasure finding, riddles, and so much more fun to be had! \nIt will invoke many memories for you of all the real and fantasy pirate stories out there, including the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' movie franchise, which are also included with a 'tall tale' story in this game. So you can go on and...\"bring me that horizon\"! ;)\nSoT is a truly excellent game for getting together online with friends & family and having an awesome time! Or just going out solo all alone (nicknamed \"hard mode\", but possibly the best way to learn faster). I would also recommend watching \"Phuzzybond\" guides and others on YouTube to learn faster the ways to success in this very unique game world.\n\nA Warning though, as I said, this game is very different from many others but in a good way...for pirates. For example, there is no safe zone in-game, you can be attacked (or meet new friends) at any time, and spawn killing is almost required sometimes...so don't take it personally if it's done to you. In this game, sometimes to sink a ship in battle you may have to board it and suppress (kill) the crew until you have looted or sunk the vessel. That means that you might have to do some spawn killing yourself sometimes or endure it. If you're not prepared for these game differences it can lead to getting a sour taste in the mouth for some new players.\n\nRemember these beginner points to help:\n- You own nothing until you cash it in, until then anyone can and may try to steal it from you and cash it in themselves! \n- You owe no one nothing! In other words, no one owes you a fight and you don't owe anyone else a fight...it's all up to you and not the other players what you decide to do (like say run, chase, fight, negotiate over mic). \n- This is a \"PVPVE\" game, not 'PvP' or 'PvE' but both, crashing together at any given time! These are not \"bad\" things if you expect them, in fact they make the game fun most of the time! It provides an element of danger & risk, paranoia, and excitement...not knowing if another boat might show up while you're selling your loot or doing whatever your up too. It makes you watch the horizon all the time, which is the developers intention. It's not supposed to be constant chaos or dead quiet but instead something 'unpredictable', and then when you've sold your loot successfully you'll get that warm feeling of accomplishment that doesn't come without the possibility of a challenge.\n- Never trust a pirate! They're not bad people at all, tons of fun actually...but they are \"Pirates\", so never forget that. (Remember you're one too, maybe you'll be the one doing all the tricking?)\n\nAs of Season 8, there is even more than ever added into the game, and a new way to get fast PvP action if you want it. This is a great addition to SoT, as it makes it less likely PvE players will run into PvP diehards, but PvPers have a way to get their PvP fix faster too! Plus, it encourages and rewards PvE players for trying out some PvP without feeling forced or unready for it.\n\nI could go on and on, there is so much more in this game that I haven't even mentioned yet, layers and layers to keep you busy for a long time! Plus, amazingly everyone is 'balanced and even' in this game! What I mean by that is, you can buy new paint-jobs and skins for your hull, cannons and ship wheels, new looks for your sword or guns, new clothing and costumes for your pirate character...but nothing changes the stats. All weapons and looks have no bonuses or stat changes. There is no \"pay to win\" going on here. So, a new player technically fires the same weapons that a long time veteran does, no advantages or disadvantages just skill level, practice, and luck....lots and lots of luck in this game! ;)\n\nIt's \"your world\" in SoT, so do whatever \"you\" like doing in it. Remember though, it's also the other pirates world too...and \"you\" are there in it! These things can collide, for better or worse, but that's what makes for amazing stories, unpredictable adventures, and maybe if you're lucky some new friends too! If you understand what you're getting into, it is such a truly amazing and rewarding game! Nothing else really like it. Try not to let any losses bring you down.\n\nI honestly can't wait to see you all out there on the seas, 'Wind In Your Sails' my new pirate friends!", "timestamp_created": 1669237470, "timestamp_updated": 1669237470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561752974987030029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128126751": {"recommendationid": "128126751", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992173991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 35742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17982, "last_played": 1694979195}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is incredible.

skills are nearly useless, the only time they'r good is when your facing multi targets. instead most use 2 guns, which are good for fighting small crews. the guns don't even get a movement nerf when

cannons, not sword play. intill they make a movement nerf for using 2 guns, this cycle will continue. and another crappy thing is that half the time, when you jump from ship to ship ship without touching the water, the game will screw your bourding attempt and put you 6 yards or a mile underwater 7 out of 10 times, which will screw you in this new hourglass pvp fights\n", "timestamp_created":

They talk to you as if you've just said the most offensive thing in the world to them and think of them as superior because they like PvPing lol. Not everyone has the time to learn this shit. I literally just want to explore the islands and do all the quests they have since they have so many but its ruined by the dogshit pvp that they so desperately want to enforce for some reason. Its not even fun PvP either. Each gun has like 5 bullets and once you kill them they can just respawn anyways. Its pretty difficult to even have a ship battle which you'd think would be improved by now considering its been 3 years and they still refuse to let you take off PvP. \n\nIts either they tell you to get good or they tell you to just be aware of your surroundings and they can easily be avoided. Which takes up so much unnecessary time when the quests already take hours to do. I've even read countless other reviews and complaints of people trying to play with their kids and stuff and it being ruined bc of the pvp and i really just dont understand why they are so persistent on enforcing this PvPvE. It makes me so sad bc there really isnt another game like this.\n\nDon't get me wrong, like I love PvP games and all, but I guess it's just the PvP in this that doesn't go too well together. Like Rust is all about PvP and I love that game. You can go on loot runs that take hours to do and lose it all and even lose your entire base that you took forever to build as well. But that's the point of the game and I love it. But even THEN, Rust ALSO has non pvp servers too. They have modded ones, strictly PvE, and ones to just practice base building or even aim training. I think the PvP aspect in rust is what they're trying to do with this game but it just doesn't work. It's more fun to do the quests and have the reward of completing it rather than being killed right as you are about to turn it in. It's different because in rust you'd just restart and do the same thing again. But having to do the same QUEST again isn't fun. Solving the same puzzles u already struggled with before. idk, that's just my opinion on this game so far.\n\nThere's already been so much debate over this topic since it's release so I doubt theres any chance itll ever change so ill just pray one day another game like this is made that is actually good. Very disappointed in this and the developers choosing to completely shut out anyone who wants PvE only. No idea why they'd want to keep their game away from casual gamers but to each their own i guess. \n\nI hope i get to see this game die in the future.

Even then, take caution. The game is really, really fun, except for interacting with other players. The problem is twofold:\n\nFirst, PvP. Unless you play a story adventure (which does not give you loot) you are inevitably going to fall victim to somebody who spends most of their hours sadistically sinking other players ships. Unless you're experienced in PvP, you're probably not going to be able to do much about this. All of the risk lies on you. It costs nothing for others to go out and attack another player and steal their loot. You will spend a couple hours doing voyages for an emissary and end up with nothing to show for it. But there's no logic to dictate what other people will do either. It would make sense to expect to be hunted when you have a large haul of treasure. I've also heard from people that just like a good ship fight. But that won't explain the other cases where you can be solo sailing and get ganked at your first stop when you're just collecting supplies. That's the type of interaction I mean when I say sadistic.\n\nSecond, matchmaking is really bad. There's no preferences, so you will just join random players, usually a new crew, and most of the time they will not communicate at all. It's an oddly common occurrence to join a crew where a silent player will decide to GO and set sail into a rock. Sometimes I do find players who communicate, use voice chat even, but many times they are only interested in PvP. It's hard to sail a ship without communication or a common goal, which is why it's better to at least play with people you know or play solo.\n\nThis is a really fun game, and it's only been getting better... but there's a severe barrier to entry and it's very discouraging to play when I end up wasting hours trying to find a crew or otherwise get sunk trying to play solo.

This wouldn't be bad if the message box didn't cover very important parts of the screen, like the bottom where I need to check if a gun is loaded or not. most time in battle you get 10s of these useless reminders that won't allow you to play properly.\n\n\nThe game is unplayable without a crew of 4 friends because of it's PvP restrictive gameplay mechanics. Within my first playthrough (playing solo as non of my friends wanted to pay that price for a multiplayer only game, an attitude I wished I had after trying it out), I was attacked twice just as I spawned in the map, another two times inside an outpost/pirate harbour, and one time by a Kraken, again, just as I spawned in, and while playing ALONE. \n\n\nSolo and Duo players also get an additional disadvantage for how much they can carry and supply; since every player's inventory is limited, it takes solo players 20-30 minutes after each ship respawn to resupply. \n\nWhat makes this worse for solo/duo and new players, is that there is no sense of player matching, no player levels, no player ranking, not even matching the types of ships in the same server (out of 10s of times I was attacked, it was almost always tier 3 (4 player) ship. Only one ship was tier 1, and it had a crew of 2).\n\nAnother point, why is attacking in outposts allowed anyway? can't you make just one safe harbour in the entire map?! this doesn't make sense at all and makes the game very prohibitive for new players. It doesn't make sense neither for realism or gameplay.\n\nwhat makes this even worse, is that in some battles, there is no flee option. Someone can force your hand into battle, and if you flee, your ship automatically sinks and you lose. so what are solo or duo players supposed to do when they are outgunned and outnumbered?! even worse, when they're anchored to sell their treasure boxes and getting new quests?!\n\nAnother element that doesn't make sense (in a pirating game) is that there is no point in boarding or stealing ships; since every crew's spawning point is their ship, if you steal a ship while the crew is away, or sneak and eliminate it's crew, they'd respawn within seconds on the same ship. not to mention that sword and gun play is very basic and clunky. So, looks like zero thought had been put into making it interesting to do anything other than sinking ships with cannons, esp if you had a bigger ship. They forced PvP into the game so much that much of the potential is lost; what's the point of adding musical instruments, pirate inns, treasure hunting, hunting and fishing....etc. when everything you spend hours on can be undone with a bunch of teen bullies who force the game into a dick competition by just roaming around sinking everyone.\n\n\nIt's not complicated to design a game with more thought on tactics and gameplay. Older games like AC4 Black Flag (which had PvP) and even the almost 20-year old Sid Meier's Pirates had gameplay mechanics that allowed you to out-manoeuvre a Man-o-War with a sloop or brigantine or use tactics to reduce a larger ship's crew before boarding...etc.\n\nBasically, if you want to enjoy this and have fun winning and losing, you need a crew of 4, and play for the sole purpose of sinking other ships. EXCEPT, there was a game that did this better; BLACKWAKE from 2020, it allowed crews up to 13 plrs, had larger ships, had more ship types, boarding and sword play was way more fun. The only drawback is it lost its player base after a peak during covid lockdowns.\n\nThat being said, the sailing is quite fun, hits a balance between realistic ship sailing and game, and ship mechanics and physics are very good too. sometimes if felt good just to look after the ship after a storm/battle, or sail aimlessly in the ocean. Again, most game elements are lost to the toxic player base and toxic PvP, you cannot actually enjoy fishing, hunting, instruments, or sailing/exploring.", "timestamp_created": 1669254912, "timestamp_updated": 1670247456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552036166191101074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134875483": {"recommendationid": "134875483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035609729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2054, "last_played": 1682014548}, "language": "english", "review": "Add about 200 more hours to what steams shows and you get my true playtime.\n\nSo how was my experiance? It's very much mixed, but the good parts only happened when played with a crew of 3 or 4 friends. Playing with just one friend was fun-fun-absolute dissapointment.\nWhy is that?\nWell, for starters, there are A LOT of toxic as all hell PvPers. And as they usually play in duos, they are reluctant to attack 4 player ships. About half of my 2 player adventures ended because of that, and usually not because we couldn't fend them off, but because those people are horrible and you have no way of avoiding them. They don't care about your treasures, they don't care about picking up loot, all they care about is attacking you. They will keep respawning and comming after you, making even finishing game session really hard - you'd like to sell your stuff, right? too bad! you have to kill some trash PvPers 2 times to do that. All you can do to avoid them is scuttle ship and start over on new server.\nOh, and they will ususally also insult you on the voice chat.\nYes, you can mute them, but for that you'll probably need to hear them first. Or you can just turn off the chat entirely, but that kind of defeats the point of social aspect of the game.\n\nThere's a lot of mechanics that suggest you should be socialising with other crews, but in fact, you're NOT presented with any opportunity to do so. Letting random ships get close without bombarding them with cannon fire is straight up suicidal, and at that point any chance of peaceful talks and drinking grog together is lost.\n\nLet's say, you want to finish your game session. So go to outpost, sell the loot, log off. Too bad! Someone is at the port, and you have to either get through them (which can be lenghty endeavor, or fast one that will make you feel like an absolute ass, as they probably just wanted to log off in peace as well, if you could sneak up on them and sink their ship). Or go to another outpost, which can easily take 15 minutes. And of course, it's also not a sure thing to work.\n\nAlso, do you dare go to the toilet? It's when most disasters struck. Mr. Murphy was right. And it's a big issue in a game where you want to have lengthy sessions.\n\nThree of the above issues I have with the game coulld be easily solved by making outposts PvP free zones, so the players can interact with each other and finish the game or just take a breather. (I'm assuming they didn't implement that, as that was the case when I've last played, and the general direction and design philosophy developers took),\n\nFew more issues:\n- having someone as a sentry is critical - so in two player crews, one gets to have fun, while the other keeps the watch. Boring. Or you just inevitably get ambushed and loose all your accumulated stuff, even if it's none. You will not get spared.\n- the game is perfect to play with kids, but it's not. Simple mechanics, graphic style and so on make it almost perfect for playing with kids. Forced PvP is not. They will get dominated, and as the game is balanced, it's borderline impossible to carry them through.\n- as the developers announced, there will never be PvE only option - not an issue per se, but seems pretty important to mention\n\nAnd just to clarify, I'm not saying all the PvPers in PvP game are toxic, just that there is a lot of the toxic kind, and as interactions with them tend to be easier to remember and have higher impact, it's overwhelming most of the time.", "timestamp_created": 1679134317, "timestamp_updated": 1679134317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552005946636199951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130293487": {"recommendationid": "130293487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186558261", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6086, "last_played": 1673034073}, "language": "english", "review": "Please do not buy this.

I'm still seeing players landing consistent pinpoint shots from incredible distances with cannons, I'm still seeing broken masts just suddenly POP back into place undamaged, I'm still seeing players \"skip\" across the water and pop up onto people's decks and crows nests without using ladders and lit powder kegs appearing on my ship deck after being dropped by players up in the sky.\nThe reality is that this game will never be free of cheaters.  The devs won't act unless it affects their bottom line and implementing anti-cheat cuts into their bottom line.)\n\nRampant cheaters are found in every facet of this game.  Whether you're queuing up for hourglass PvP or trying to finish a Tall Tale, you absolutely WILL encounter someone using some third-party tool to get an edge over you.  Reporting these cheaters is a needlessly demanding and almost absurd task, as every time I've tried to report blatant hacking Rare has required me to submit *VIDEO EVIDENCE* to them before they'll actually look into any reports of cheaters/hackers.  Nobody playing any game should be expected to fire up OBS and record every game session just so you can give the game devs what they want in a report.  Even then, it's still a 50/50 shot on whether or not they'll actually take appropriate action.  It's proven to be a waste of time. Heck, you may find yourself on the business end of a suspension yourself for wasting *their* time with enough reports submitted without video.\n\nRare's fervent unwillingness to properly address the issue of cheaters/hackers has really soured me on this game over the last nine months.  Even if you manage to get yourself a full crew that knows what they're doing there's just nothing you can really do to stop yourselves from being the on the receiving end of an aim bot or the sudden appearances of lit powder kegs on your vessel.  Leaving the game and signing back in, hoping for a server less full of this kind of thing, or turning the game off entirely are your only options.\n\ntl;dr\nCheaters are extremely common and the devs don't care.\nYour time is valuable so spend it playing something else.", "timestamp_created": 1687958461, "timestamp_updated": 1689754762, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551035702228546143", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135394293": {"recommendationid": "135394293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873038127", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 10937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7747, "last_played": 1689450698}, "language": "english", "review": "\u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0437\u0443\u0435\u0432\u0443 \u0431\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0445\u0443\u0439\u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e", "timestamp_created": 1679753218, "timestamp_updated": 1679753218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550714790821075439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136478476": {"recommendationid": "136478476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820053236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 12337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 9740, "last_played": 1695998543}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game, awful community. \n\nI don't like any of you.", "timestamp_created": 1681143675, "timestamp_updated": 1681143675, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550696730613708496", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133878553": {"recommendationid": "133878553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015236049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 11689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6477, "last_played": 1679991401}, "language": "english", "review": "Like GTAV freeroam, but Pirate of the Caribbean.\nIt's a pvp focused game, but there are some pve contents.\n- Fun with friends.\n- Hard mode if you solo (but manageable if you join Sea of Thieves Discord Community for LFG channel)\n- Open Crew is basically open public lobby for other players to join and maybe grief you.\n- You have to link your Xbox/Microsoft account to play this game, good thing I already have one from Minecraft, but I can see this as being an annoying step to play this game \n (To invite friends/non-friends fast: Windows key + G opens the Xbox overaly to \"Invite to Game\" when you right click on a gamertag).\n- A lot of pve quests takes at least 30 min to complete and sell, so keep that in mind.

So I had to edit registry to fix it. Xbox offered me to change the name for free, I did. It never told me that it's going to actually use numbers in the game along with the nickname. Tried changing it again (now it's $10 for a pop) and it doesn't work. Figured out I need to use VPN for some reason and set it to US to buy it.\n\nConstantly getting stuck on various loading messages and when buying cosmetics for a ship. According to google - those issues existed since the start of the game. Nothing works except alt+f4. \n\nJoined a group using xbox panel - called n-word repeatedly as soon as they heard my accent and told me I am some sort of \"sand n-word\", then kicked me.\n\nStarted doing adventure with Jack Sparrow. Went afk for a bit, came back, turns out game kicks you for inactivity after 10 minutes. Somehow it skipped the first part of the adventure completely and put me ahead on the next part. \n\nStarted doing emissary quest, needed to go afk for a moment again, kicked for inactivity again, came back to find out that it completely deletes all progress and the quest itself. According to Google people been asking to change how it works for years. Coupled with constantly getting stuck on loading or buying - good luck finishing anything without constantly restarting.\n\nThis game is simultaneously one of the most inconvenient, bugged and apparently racist I have ever encountered so far, but also has interesting mechanics, pretty graphics, long quest chains and good music. \n\nWill update the review after playing more.\n\n------------\n\nMore issues:\n\n1) Bought same bundle twice by accident. No way to refund it. Due to the way bundles are redeemed, they are counted as in-game items and automated refund doesn't even see them separately. Now I have a bundle stuck in my Steam inventory forever. Steam support doesn't understand or care about the issue, game support sends you to Steam support.\n\n2) Buying items in Emporium for real currency is disabled in my region, because prices in regional currency are cheaper than buying ancient coins. Game support doesn't admit or deny it, just thanks you for your concern.\n\n3) Lots and lots of toxic, horrible players. Open microphones with swears and blasting terrible music; yelling children; people joining and stealing/crashing/burning your ship, then leaving; no way to report anyone, since they require VIDEO PROOF of everything. \n\nOverall - PvE aspect of this game is very good, adventures, tall tales, looting wrecks, doing underwater shrines with puzzles, killing npc mobs and ships... but when it comes to PvP aspect, it's not hardcore, it's not fun, it's just annoying and toxic. Losing hours of work to some try-hards chasing you through entire map, not being able to sell items fast (even with sovereign faction), constantly encountering toxic people with open mic's yelling obscenities or blasting weird **** in megaphones - it's all incredibly daunting. \n\nIt's also telling that people are complaining about exactly the same things everywhere, all the time, but a minority (seems no more than 15-30%%) of people vehemently defend the PvP system so they can continue preying on new players, be toxic, trolling and self-actualizing by ruining the fun for everyone else. \n\nDare I say - if this game had dedicated PvE and PvP servers, or PvP toggle - it would've been even more popular and interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1688019683, "timestamp_updated": 1688464996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549872100353240967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143032916": {"recommendationid": "143032916", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141699703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12544, "last_played": 1694683188}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun to play only when you know what you're doing, if you are a new player and don't have anyone to help you then i wish you the best of luck because when you set sails, there will be people in the sea just looking for someone to PVP, they don't care who you are and how skill are you, they will start blasting you when you're in range, and you know what the best part you can't do anything about it, because the game force you to PVP and if you're not good at it then too bad your ship is now under the sea.\nOnly buy this game if like the PVP aspect of the game, if not and you want to play this game just to feel like being a pirate, having fun with your friends and don't want to PVP then don't waste your money and time on this game, the devs create this game so the playerbase to PVP they have no intentions to make this game easier for casuals and people who like to this game to fight the AI.", "timestamp_created": 1690651504, "timestamp_updated": 1690651504, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549839258193969727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147044604": {"recommendationid": "147044604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012360166", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 292, "playtime_at_review": 1574, "last_played": 1695707375}, "language": "english", "review": "Not new player friendly.

PVE - can get quite boring after 100/200 hours\n5. you WILL get tilted sometimes...but remember you also upset other players ;)\nPROs:\n1. the pve aspect is great for newer players (but in my opinion getting better at pvp should be your goal ultimately)\n2. you can play it solo (better have a bit of experience) but i highly recommend playing it with your friend/ open crew(can get messy) /find players on other  platforms to play with. It's one of the best coop-games i know because it actually involves coordination and searching solutions together\n3. a lot of stuff to do - you have many different missions, world events, talltales, etc - but they can get repetitive once you realize only some of them are actually worth your time\n4. amazing ocean animation - after 2 years I'm still amazed by them\n5. pvp never gets boring if you can find opponents who dont just run away from you\n6. it's open world - sail wherever you want (please dont sail into the red sea, that's the boundary of the map not an event and you will sink)\n7. regular updates, seasons with a plunder pass (battle pass). great rank up system in-game with the different factions and their reputation you can level up, different achievements, and cosmetics to unlock.\n8. almost everything you buy with irl money/gold wont give you an advantage, it's purely cosmetic (some cosmetics can give you a slight advantage) but you cant pay to win.\n9. I'm not the biggest fan of alliances (unless i fight them) but maybe you are - you can make an alliance with other ships/players and you get a portion of the gold they make\ntipp:\n1. Watch guides (it'll take you too long to realize some game meachanics or sailing speed of different ship types,etc) your learning curve will go up massively\n\nBuy the game - if you like one of the below:\n- coop \n- open world\n- games where you can grind for hours\n- you like epic pvp\n- the obvious one: you like boats and pirates\n\nYou have probably already watched a sea of thieves video/stream if you're down here in the reviews - if not, do so, it will get you the best impression of the game unless they are just fishing (watch the epic pvp battles)\nFor my part, if your're on the fence of buying this game i say DO IT - if a steam sale is coming up soon wait for it, rn the game is only 20 euros (-50%)  - it's defenitely worth it", "timestamp_created": 1672480637, "timestamp_updated": 1672865392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547359585762023926", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147422151": {"recommendationid": "147422151", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088298382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2571, "playtime_at_review": 15470, "last_played": 1696441410}, "language": "english", "review": "Cheaters, bugs, broken game", "timestamp_created": 1696154258, "timestamp_updated": 1696154258, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142921735": {"recommendationid": "142921735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968094318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 7326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6835, "last_played": 1690857924}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the water, I like the sailing, I like the storms, I like the activities, I like the first Monkey Island tall tale, I like the PvE, and it's going to hurt to leave a negative on this because the game has stuff that I like and I keep trying to enjoy it.\n\nI wasn't going to leave a review until I read the last news update.

If you look at a lot of the top helpful reviews, people want PvE. It's been begged for for years. I get it, when the game came out there would have been so little PvE that it would have been bare and boring. I think there is enough to justify it by now. I like doing the merchant stuff, the PvE challenges but it's hard to do those things with other players harassing me. I just want to vibe but PvP is forced and it is not fun. Sometimes they just want to kill you and move on, sometimes they want to grief you and spawn camp you, sometimes they're just blatantly cheating. So no, I wouldn't say they listen to the community. I would honestly have more fun with the game and play longer periods of time if I could just vibe in a PvE environment.\n\nThe thing that makes me leave the game every time I try to get into it is other players. It's a sandbox for murder hobos and griefers and to say the community is \"one of the best\" just makes you shake your head. It's even funnier if you notice that they acknowledge these issues by having an in-game option to change servers if you're getting griefed. It's a big enough problem that they have an escape option, but won't offer a more permanent solution.

You spawn in on a beautiful sandy outpost island with a barely stocked ship, and you can just raise anchor and sail anywhere you want to go. If you find an island you can stop off to get more supplies, but often you'll be attacked by a creepy pirate skeleton and it's crew.\n\nPlayer combat is simple and a little clunky, but once you learn the rhythm of sword swings or reloading the blunderbuss, it feels pretty natural. My favorite is just blasting skeletons into fragments. There are random quest hooks you can find in barrels, or buried in the ground, or dropped in Skeleton's Orders, and you can aimlessly roam the seas gathering treasures and playing sea shanties.\n\nOccasionally you'll come across another player-sailed ship, spotted as a silhouette mast on the horizon. You can avoid them, or sail up and say hi, but often they will respond explosively once you're within cannon range. Naval battles are exciting; a mad balance between blasting holes in your opponent's hull while you furiously try to fix your own.\n\nThe best part of the game, however, is that the cost of loss is only relative to the amount of risk you take. If you try to play seriously, there are massive rewards for taking higher risks, but the loss on those runs are more sharply felt. If you just like sailing and selling a few chests when you pull into port, the game is very relaxing and rewarding as you unlock cooler cosmetics and better quests. Even losing a PvP fight or getting sunk in a naval battle can be a barely inconvenient deterrent if you manage your risks properly.\n\nI am not a \"hardcore\" player and I'll more likely avoid aggressive players than try to take them down, but for a casual pirate simulator it's a great exploration game with a little spice of random cannon-related stress sprinkled in.", "timestamp_created": 1675870469, "timestamp_updated": 1675870469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545837819576263428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139885270": {"recommendationid": "139885270", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122113206", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2450, "last_played": 1686538781}, "language": "english", "review": "Iv'e played this game a whole lot more than 40 hours on Xbox and let me tell u when i first started playing this game i didn't know if i would like it or not but turns out i did in the long run but let me stop talking about myself and get to the point what i'm trying to say is this game is worth every penny because if your just looking for a good/great game well u have found it because on Sea of thieves u can just chill with your friends & have fun exploring the sea of thieves together", "timestamp_created": 1686482466, "timestamp_updated": 1686482466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545576214790344238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147656232": {"recommendationid": "147656232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201266114", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 34339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2246, "playtime_at_review": 34258, "last_played": 1696503167}, "language": "english", "review": "I get to be a pirate", "timestamp_created": 1696470664, "timestamp_updated": 1696470664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143998553": {"recommendationid": "143998553", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224756362", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 610, "last_played": 1691854214}, "language": "english", "review": "u get stupid", "timestamp_created": 1691848013, "timestamp_updated": 1691848013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142238726": {"recommendationid": "142238726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198978249621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 35457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1053, "playtime_at_review": 34033, "last_played": 1696022722}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently unplayable, laggy servers making pvp impossible, cheaters everywhere and barely optimized, devs would rather make new stories that nobody asked for and create new cosmetics than invest in an anticheat and better servers.

People will always complain. do not listen to those, try it out for yourself since you can cheaply get it on game pass if you have that. Though the steam version has some benefits like exclusive Fullscreen and such I cant remember that though.\n\nHowever back to the game. You will get into PVP, although now you have an opt in system arena system you can still and will still be attact. That is the nature of the game. But all player encounters are different. aspacially if you use voice in game and are a bit witty. \n\nThe gold and treasure you find on your adventures are not yours until you sold them. And its not about the gold, its about the glory. The epic fights! I remember my first victory as a solo slooper against a mighty galleon. The more you do the PVP the better you get at it. \n\nYou will have the occasional toxic people yes but best you ignore those. If a fight is unwinnable, just start a new game. you'll not loose much in the long run.\n\nPlay it with friends and have fun exploring.\nDon't watch how to complete a quest or tall tale (story missions) just figure it out yourself. \n\nThe community is great and helpful. I have had plenty of encounters where I noticed the crew I fought was new (tell tale signs, anchor down sails down etc.) I will stop and help them on their way.\n\nThis world is your oyster and you can do with it what you want. there is no set way of playing. \nJust the open sea.\n\nI have 1.8k hours on steam and 1k hours on MS store (yes i bought the game twice) \nI would play it every second

Does the bare minimum you'd expect for a pirate game. A massive game with barely anything to do, and poor motivation to do it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, most of the map consists of an ocean, but for some reason the game does not offer that much to do while sailing. Directing the ship does not take that much effort, so you are left to either play an extremely simple fishing minigame, stare at food while it cooks, or play one of the dozen or so songs that you'll get tired of in an hour. None of which are that productive or engaging.\n\nThe game features repetitive quests of predetermined objectives ad infinitum. Combat has very few options, and feels extremely floaty - guns are slow and have no kick to them alongside enemies barely reacting to attacks, and sword swings have no weight while only featuring at most 3 moves. Swing, Block, and Big Swing. Most combat encounters also have no stakes to them. Death has no penalty against any non-player, non-ship NPC, besides a brief wait time. You can just keep throwing yourself at whatever until you win. The only possibly highlight would be ship battles with a crew, in which a team must coordinate between steering, combat, and fixing the ship. These can be slightly engaging. Then, gathering treasures and rewards is a tedious process of finding the most efficient way to drag everything you've earned back to your ship, one item at a time (maybe 3 if you have a spare chest). After the resources have been gathered you must repeat the process at the outposts to sell it.\n\nThat is also hoping that you are not hunted down by other players for your loot. Playing single player makes you an easy enough target, but regardless of your crew count, you can be attacked by players of varying skill, and should you be unlucky you can have all of your work plundered, leaving you with nothing but a few hours of completely wasted time. \n\nAll of this effort is to be able to afford pretty much only cosmetics. They all kind of blend together as generic pirate gear, with all the best and most unique gear and additions being locked behind premium currencies, or they require a very long period of grinding. There is very little reward or sense of growth given for completing the same-y quests.\n\nAnd possibly worst of all is the extremely slow development of the game itself. Half of each addition is just cosmetics, but the developers are also slow to dish out quality of life additions, or even stuff you'd expect in a game like this. The most recent update featured the ability to buy and name your boat, which seems like it should have been a given. It also featured the ability to sell loot to a single individual rather than each vendor respectfully, which relieves only a bit of the tedious loading and unloading of treasure.

Key word there is 'manage'. \n\nI really want to play this game, I want to discover cool islands, sail the seas, and unearth all the whimsical secrets of the world. But I can't, because every time I hop on to play, I inevitably end up being grieved by a large crew in a galleon, or blown up by hackers spawning  explosive barrels onto my measly two-person sloop. I've literally been chased out of bounds by a four-person crew, I had no loot or anything for them to gain. They just did so because they could. when I asked them to leave me alone, as I was just trying to play the game, they responded \"we are too\". Which speaks for itself. \n\nOn Rare's website, they market the game as follows: \"Sea of Thieves offers the ultimate pirate experience, a sandbox world packed to the seams with sailing and exploring, battling and plundering, riddle solving and treasure hunting.\" The game does have all this, yes, but you'll likely never get to experience much of it, the community make sure of this. There is a story mode, but to put it bluntly, it's just okay.  \n\nIf you're a casual gamer, have a full-time job, are trying to play solo, or all of the above, this game is not for you. Playing simply doesn't feel worth the hassle. \n\nEDIT- As a last ditch effort to play this game, I decided to give it one more go. I went in with the intention to try and avoid players. It took 3 minutes of being on the open water on the way to my destination to be trailed by a brigantine. The chase lasted about 15 minutes, they were always too far behind to start combat. Finally I gave in as I knew they weren't going to leave me alone, so, I docked at the nearest outpost, disembarked my sloop, found a nice high up location at the outpost to watch the crew of neon blue pirates rapid fire cannons at my anchored ship until it sunk into the ocean. The finale of this session was me sitting there motionless as they ran up to me to finish the job, I couldn't be bothered to fight back. This was when I hit alt+f4 and just uninstalled the game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1692451305, "timestamp_updated": 1692533471, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544345498085021973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137757047": {"recommendationid": "137757047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072176158", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 327, "last_played": 1682825574}, "language": "english", "review": "PvP aspect ruins the game.

You wanna know what i mean by cheaters?? watch this video to find out, how can i compete against someone in a game when they have these admin like powers (and more)..  \n\n\nUpdate JULY 2023 - cheaters are still a huge problem, especially in hour glass battles. Developers aren't doing anything to prevent them from taking over. They ban people but they just get new accounts and come back. They cant hardware ban them either cause ppl can just unban themselves.. its pointless to report as they just come back.  Cheaters are running off the real players and game is going to die just like all the other games before this has happened too. \n\n\n https://youtu.be/lhwdzK1Y37s", "timestamp_created": 1674980019, "timestamp_updated": 1690083056, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541772127151489258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127222672": {"recommendationid": "127222672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205620525", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 21562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10807, "playtime_at_review": 542, "last_played": 1696543204}, "language": "english", "review": "vry naas", "timestamp_created": 1669557240, "timestamp_updated": 1669557240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541762113571166992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147242955": {"recommendationid": "147242955", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229465024", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_at_review": 4073, "last_played": 1696041757}, "language": "english", "review": "yes pirate go arrr and my gun go boom", "timestamp_created": 1695942910, "timestamp_updated": 1695942910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141376968": {"recommendationid": "141376968", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039937549", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2303, "last_played": 1653045746}, "language": "english", "review": "Got a cat here.

You'll encounter plenty of Krakens, megalodons, and other sea monsters along the way, not to mention the occasional cannonball to the face from enemy pirate ships. And don't even get me started on the dreaded \"skeleton fortresses\" that will test your skills and bravery like never before.\n\nBut fear not, me hearties, for the rewards of playing Sea of Thieves are well worth the risks. There's nothing quite like the thrill of discovering buried treasure on a deserted island, or successfully fending off a rival pirate crew to claim the ultimate prize. And let's not forget the hilarious hijinks that can ensue when you and your friends get a little too much grog in your systems.\n\nOverall, Sea of Thieves is a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, whether you're sailing solo or with a crew of fellow pirates. So if you're looking for a swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, then set sail for the world of Sea of Thieves and prepare for a wild ride.

While I only have 300 hours of gameplay on steam I played it for far more time while it was exclusively on the microsoft store which I have no doubt equates to around 1000 hours in total.\n\nThis means I am currently level 30 in Athena fortune, level 75 in gold hoarders, level 75 in order of souls, and level 75 merchants alliance.\n\nSo yeah I have played the game a fair amount and know every aspect of it like the back of my hand.\n\nWhat is good\n\nSo let us start off with the good, because yes there is good stuff in this game, and it is at times fun to play.\n\nSailing is fun, the mechanics are pretty good, fishing is fun because its mechanics were well designed, world events are fun, from skeleton forts to skeleton fleets. If you are bored, doing a world event is enjoyable, the game is very beautiful, additionally ship to ship combat is enjoyable.\n\nRight now lets start on the very long list of what is wrong with this game. I was going to start with a lack of tutorial but eventually long after launch Rare added a tutorial, this triple AAA game released without a proper and functioning tutorial.\n\nThe game is slowly dying\n\nThis game from top to bottom is just badly designed, and as a result a lot of the time it just isn\u2019t fun. Don\u2019t get me wrong I have had literally hundreds of hours of fun in this game, I\u2019ve also had hundreds of hours of mundane boring, completely pointless grinding. Sea Of Thieves is lucky to get more than 20,000 average players on steam every day, a pitifully low number.\n\nAnd even if you be very generous and double or triple those figures to 60000 players to include both PC and xbox, that's still pretty low considering on its steam page, rare proudly proclaims that 15 million people have played SOT, which is no doubt largely down to SOT being on the xbox/pc game pass, but I digress, it really puts in perspective just how dull SOT gameplay is when 15 million people have played the game and yet just 20000 people on steam stuck with it.\n\nRares refusal to acknowledge virtually all of the completely fair criticism of this game\n\nI remember when this game first came out and it was riddled with bugs. I'll be honest it didn\u2019t actually bother me that much. What did bother me was the complete lack of repeatable and enjoyable gameplay, the entire questing system was based off RNG for reasons Rare never properly explained, the updates came thick and fast for a while, every single week. Sounds good right? Well the problem was that they were pumping out that many updates that they were adding as many bugs every week as they were fixing.\n\nBut most problematic is the complete disconnect between what Rare thought SOT was and what the community knew SOT was, a hot mess. I remember laughing to my friends about how people on reddit were complaining and complaining and complaining about problems with the game and every single week all we got from Rare was Joe Neate smiling at the camera assuring everything was fine, and that all would be well.\n\nMeaningful progression is non existent, gold and XP are worthless\n\nRare in its boundless wisdom decided from the outset that every player regardless of their level should get a fair playing field whenever they fight. Now here's the thing rare, not only is removing meaningful forms of progression obnoxiously lazy video game design but it also makes any gold and XP in the game worthless, think about it logically, if you can\u2019t use gold, to buy a faster ship, a better sword, a stronger crew, or a better hull, if you can only use gold to buy cosmetics, the gold thus has literally no value to you as a player, none.\n\nThe same can be said for levelling, outside of unlocking certain missions, there is literally no purpose to levelling guilds; it gives you nothing in game, no advantage. So congratulations Rare. You used the thinly veiled excuse of every player having a fair fight against one another to justify lazy video game design, and in the process made acquiring gold and levelling utterly devoid of any purpose.\n\nBattle Royale Removed\n\nSOT gameplay consists of either adventure, a pirates life, or a maiden voyage, oh and there also used to be a battle royal mode, but after no doubt spending 1000s of man hours on developing that game mode to jump on the battle royal hype train they then removed it because not enough people played it. As someone who didn\u2019t really play the battle royal game mode I\u2019d say this is a really stupid idea, the player than enjoyed playing this game may have been a minority but a lot of people really, REALLY enjoyed this gamemode, for example it was very popular among streamers there was no logical reason to remove it.\n\nSo yeah ignoring the battle royal mode that Rare no doubt spent tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of pounds developing and then scrapped, lets focus on adventure.\n\nMatchmaking is abysmal\n\nMatchmaking is terrible, five years after launch the only options available to you are two options: play with friends or play with randoms.\n\nThere's no option for you to join your friends when there ship is full, which is almost always the case because the max crew size is just four, yep people thats it, hope you don\u2019t have a many friends, rare could allow you join the same server as your friends and start on a different ship but that would allow alliance servers the people cry out, well as gold and XP in the game are worthless why would this matter.\n\nThere's no option as a new player to join the ship of an experienced crew to learn how to play the game, there's no option as an experienced player to join a new player crew and teach them how to play, these are very easy fixes to do, but rare is lazy and after five years the matchmaking still sucks.\n\nThe basic gameplay loop of SOT is not in my opinion fun, the main reason is a combination of a complete lack of objectives for players to sink their teeth into, needlessly grindy and lacking in depth gameplay which isn\u2019t fun, and also even now after all this time there is just not that much to do.\n\nLack of clear objectives\n\nWhen you spawn into the game you start in the pub and then it's up to you. No objectives in sight, and the reason this really hampers gameplay is because of the bad matchmaking system, remember it's just play with friends or play with randoms, so if you create a crew of randoms and you want to achieve an objective there's no easy way to tell they to do that, do not bring up the pirate wheel, it's a badly designed janky cluttered mess. When you compare it to a game like league of legends which also has an objective wheel that takes less than half a second to tell every player on your team what you want to do, and where you want to go, it puts the joke of a wheel system that Rare created to shame.\n\nYou will not believe the amount of times I have spent hours just trying to convince my crew to do an objective because guess what guys, there is no way to kick players from you ship, if you get a player that is useless or tries to sabotage your ship the best you can do is lock them in the brig where they receive all of your gold and XP for doing nothing. Tell me Rare why when there are good players and there are bad players, why can i not kick someone from my ship? It literally makes no sense and is just part of what paralyses all of this game I like to call the \u2018devoid of logic Rare disease\u2019.\n\nSo playing with randoms is not really an option if you want to earn decent gold and XP not only because of the bad matchmaking system, but also that Rares flat out refuses to let you kick bad players. So the only way to properly play this game is to play with friends, don\u2019t have a", "timestamp_created": 1696281881, "timestamp_updated": 1696281881, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2,

Played it for hours and hours and hours when it first came out, back when there were only three factions and the only event was the skeleton fort. Eventually moved on because there was nothing left to achieve in the game at the time. Picked up the 2023 edition in the Steam Summer Sale for the exclusive cosmetics and for easier matchmaking with friends who have the game through Steam (and because the Microsoft Store sucks, but I digress).\n\nI hate what this game has become. It's gone from being a very simple game with little content to more content than anyone could hope to achieve in a lifetime. Gone are the days when being Pirate Legend meant something. Now it's practically just the intro to the game. But the biggest issue with this game is that [i]you can't actually complete any of its content anymore[/i] because no matter what you do--even if you don't raise an emissary flag (which makes you a more lucrative target for PvPers), even if you're doing Tall Tales (the PvE questline), even if you're just f***ing fishing--some randoms will jump you for a fight, and now you're stuck PvPing for an indefinite amount of time. And the biggest issue with PvP is that unless there's a [i]substantial[/i] skill difference between you and your opponent in either direction, it basically ends up being a stalemate lasting over an hour in which neither of you can sink the other. And since the vast majority of players (myself included) are frankly just mediocre at PvP, that ends up being pretty much every time. And don't come at me with \"git gud\" bulls***; some of us are f***ing casuals who just wanna enjoy some treasure-hunting PvE with friends. Besides, if any of you were actually good, you'd think somebody would have actually managed to sink me by now instead of just wasting everyone's time as described.\n\nNot to mention, you have to spend multiple hours in this game every session to make any progress at all, because it takes that long to actually gather a substantial amount of loot and painstakingly sell it item-by-item. And that's [i]if[/i] you get lucky enough to be able to play for more than an hour at a time without getting roped into a PvP stalemate.\n\nThis game is a massive, frustrating time sink in which it feels nearly impossible to actually [i]achieve[/i] anything. Don't waste your time unless your [i]only[/i] goal is to d*** around with friends, and even then, expect to spend most of it sailing around in circles with some other dunces, both of you whiffing your cannon shots and failing boarding attempts until you finally decide it isn't even worth bothering anymore.

The other 95% of the encounters will range between the silent killers that don't even talk and just treat the game as if it was competative, to kids who just learned a couple slurs so they use it in this game while fighting you.(Don't worry some adults also swear all the same and put the blame on you even if they happen to lose the battle that they started.)\n\nThe combat is the worst offender tbh, if the game was more centered around ships i'm pretty sure a lot of people would enjoy pvp more. But the combat right now is just a shitty fortnite rip off. You jump around with guns to have the adventage over people, eat underwater/shoot underwater/throw grenades underwater/light a fuse underwater, That's also because some veterans figured out that it's easier to win if you don't allow the other crew to play. So this is the main strategy every encounter will revolve around. You wanted to enjoy maintaining a ship during a fierce battle? You have to sit by the ladder and watch because the same person will try to get onboard and cause mayhem. (which would lead to your crew being unable to fight the opposing ship.) \n\nThe non pvp side of the game is pretty relaxing. You can literally just log on with 3 friends and sail around doing nothing. It's a really good game to just talk in and enjoy the scenery. We did do this a bunch in the past, just sailing and chatting.\nNot even doing events, Maybe a little fishing. \n\nBut if you wish to do content then there is plenty to do even without pvp.

Hey, I guess their only love really is the sea. People will legitimately just sit outside of objectives waiting eternally for other ships to complete them and then sink their ships for loot. Why be an asshole and sink a new player's ship in a situation like this? It takes a new player longer to do objectives because they're newer; more loot could be acquired by the aggressor in a much faster time if they didn't sit waiting. The only reason I can think of is that they genuinely enjoy ruining the small amount of progress new players make and then justify it with the minimal amounts of loot they might collect from their sunken remains. I can only conclude that most Sea of Thieves players are not actually people, but are instead Tardigrades. It's the most logical conclusion given how they can thrive and survive for so long in such a toxic environment while retrieving so little nourishment.  Technically all of the collectibles and loot only allow you to buy cosmetics, but it's basically the only sense of progression in the game. It genuinely feels wrong to constantly rob that small sense of progress from new players. This may actually be a silver lining, as I wouldn't put it past the players in this game to use hard-to-grind loot as a way to endlessly pummel newer ships even further. The game allows you to propose alliances with other ships, but this doesn't prevent allies from attacking you or stealing your loot. You gain 100% of the gold on items you sell in an alliances and allies gain 50% of the 100% you gain. It's not split between you both, you get the full price while all allies gain a \"duplicated\" 50% of what you earn. Alliances sound like a cool concept on paper with the potential for betrayal on the high seas or a long alliance paying off when you go to turn your loot in, but in reality it just allows people to backstab you on a dime and sink your ship with the first strike. People will genuinely attack your ship in an alliance for no reason, even if it's not for the 50% more they could have from turning loot in themselves. This one time I completed some fortress event with some folks in an alliance and took all of the loot back to THEIR ship. Our ships got separated for a bit of time during an attack from an enemy ship. When we regrouped we sat peacefully for a while until the enemy ship returned. Our allies ended up returning the favor by shooting MY crew's ship out of the blue and then sailed away to fight the enemy ship. I couldn't even retaliate it was so quick. I didn't fight back because I thought somehow it might have been the enemy ship firing until I saw where the cannonballs were actually coming from. My crew talked with theirs and we were all getting along well while we fought waves of skeletons for nearly two hours before. I couldn't believe they had done it, or even more, why. I decided to wait a little while in case they turned our loot in and did some fishing and exploring for an hour or two. I never saw their ship sink on the map, but I can't be sure if they survived the encounter alone with the enemy ship. Even if they did, they never turned it in. My crew left without ever seeing that 50% that would have jump started us in terms of progression. People will also pretend to be friendly while your ship is attacked by megalodons and other creatures. They will legitimately start a conversation with you as they pass or say hello and then loop back around after you finish the fight just to sink you and take your loot. Heartless. What ever happened to the sailor's motto of Faith, Courage, Service true, with Honor, Over Honor, Over All? You basically HAVE to play aggressively in this game to avoid being backstabbed by an ally or to get the first strike on a potential threat. It creates such a brew of toxicity I'm surprised the seas don't glow green like the Chicago River on Saint Patrick's day.If you've made it this far I hope you've enjoyed reading. Maybe you'll er more towards caution when thinking about or actually sailing the seas. I'm sure a lot of new players give up easily seeing how much of a cesspit the nearly unavoidable PVP scene is in Sea of Thieves. I totally understand that the game is themed around being a pirate which involves looting and ship combat, but that doesn't make it right to pick on new and defenseless players just because you can. Sinking their ship before they can even put up a fight is not going to teach them anything and is only going to kill off the general playerbase in the long run. A sea is not like a marsh or a body of still sitting water. It's constantly moving and always has new and old waters running through it.", "timestamp_created": 1679715855, "timestamp_updated": 1679721500, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532625198364257813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129692950": {"recommendationid": "129692950", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013684353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1672408497}, "language": "english", "review": "I know there's many people that like the PVP aspect but I think there is a huge player group that would play the game if a PVE option was available.

I both undoubtedly adore this game and absolutely hate it. I don't compare pros or cons often in a review, but for this. It's needed, so let's start with the good.\n\nThe good in this game is it's very addicting and fun. I have sunk hours and hours into the game without even realizing it, and it has so many things you can do. Your playtime could be 400 hours to 2,000, maybe more if you really wanted to do everything, and that's insane just thinking about it. The graphics are beautiful. Just taking in the small moments without fighting or being too focused on anything is peaceful and makes you realize how beautiful the game is. And on a personal note, for someone who had Pirate101 as one of their main childhood games, this brought back a lot of pleasant memories.\n\nNow the bad. This game is incredibly grindy. Now that's good in some cases because, it makes you keep playing the game for a very long time. But to a certain extent, it is ridiculous how you have to spend an hour, maybe longer, just to make your progress bar go up two to four inches in a faction. And I already talked about how much playtime could be put into Sea of Thieves, and that's great. The bad part about that is how this game is a huge time consumer. If you want to play a little bit of Sea of Thieves, you'd need more than two hours just to make progress, more additional hours depending on what you're doing. And the worst part about this game is the players, toxic players. I know it is very luck dependent in this game with what kind of people you will run into. But out of my entire time playing this game. There have been so many hateful, petty, and narcissistic players that it has caused me to quit the game once. It doesn't matter what you're doing. You could be doing a Tall Tale, which is a story-driven quest, you could be peacefully fishing with no treasure on your boat. You could be doing nothing! And the players will not care and kill you out of their own enjoyment. You could be saying that it's a pirate game and you aren't supposed to be good, and that's true. But people take it way too seriously and act way too hateful which ruins the game for me in some cases. I hate to list so many explanations, but people need to know.\n\nSea of Thieves is more than a video game. It's your adventure where you create your own path, you choose your quests, you determine your sides, and you form your story. After all of this, Sea of Thieves is a game worth playing.

Grab a friend or 2 and get into it so we can sink you and take your $hit..\n\nGame does involve some 12yo's yelling out racial slurs when you kill them.", "timestamp_created": 1672126299, "timestamp_updated": 1682046795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531320095062255859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147063064": {"recommendationid": "147063064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930211195", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2032, "playtime_at_review": 5778, "last_played": 1696416195}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game ruined by terrible hit reg and constant cheaters", "timestamp_created": 1695739032, "timestamp_updated": 1695739032, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144183783": {"recommendationid": "144183783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082192072", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 6410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2002, "last_played": 1694634350}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1][/b]Sea of \u200b\u200bThieves (aka Sea of Cheaters) is what I would call a missed masterpiece, I really wish I could recommend this game but no matter how hard I try, I can't do it. \n[hr][/hr][b][h1][u]My conclusions:[/u][/h1][/b]This game can be terrifyingly fun and deeply frustrating at the same time.\nI first played this game when it came out in the now distant 2018 thanks to the \u20ac1 Gamepass so I can see it with the eyes of a person who knows what SoT was at the time and knows what SoT is today.\n\nLet me start by saying that I don't criticize the idea of \u200b\u200bfighting and sinking other player's ships. \nIt's perfect for those who like competition and those who like to snatch the loot from others.\nHowever I don't approve how the game doesn't respect that part of players who have no interest in competing and just want to continue their journey with serenity.\nI always laughed at the uselessness of the advice given on the Ferryman's ship once you died, whose message can be perfectly summarized with: \"Sick of being sunk by others? SUNK YOURSELF\". Wow, really comforting.\nInitially I didn't mind PvP at all because, simply, there weren't many broken mechanics and strategies like now, also thanks to the fact that people didn't aim only to tryhard and bug abuse/cheat/exploit the entire time.\n\nI think I speak for everyone when I say that what was so captivating about SoT were the stunning environments, the sense of novelty and naval combat, to this day we still have no games comparable to SoT or worthy rivals.\nIs it a fun game? Yes definitely.\nBut I suggest you pay close attention to what you are about to buy and what you are going to get into.\n\nBad PvP and community issues aside, this game requires insane amounts of hours to both loot, level up and earn some gold.\nThe first 20/50 hours are pure entertainment, if you haven't spoiled anything, the sense of discovery and adventure that you will experience on every journey will be unmatched, especially if played with some friends, even played as a solo has its charm.\nOnce you become an expert sailor you will begin to understand the real mechanics of the game and only then you will begin to really understand what SoT is like and get an idea about the game itself.\n\nNew payers and the ones who haven't already done everything in the game a minimum of 999 times will be forced to cope because there is no lobby system and most likely will be in the same lobbies with tryhards whose life revolves entirely around this game and bug abusing, exploiting and cheating.\nTrust me: trying to catch up with these 3000+ PvP hours players is nearly impossible if you don't want to invest a minimum of 5+ hours per day playing SoT. \n\nI won't dwell on the scandals Rare has been involved in. (unjustified bans, unmotivated defenses of Streamers etc, etc)\nBelow I list some of the pros and cons I encountered both now and when I played SoT years ago.\n\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list][*]The game, just like any other multiplayer around, is extremely fun to play with friends. \n\n[*]Regarding PvE I got nothing to say; compared to the past they have made great strides by adding a lot of stuff to do, exploration is certainly not lacking.\n\n[*]The overall mechanics of exploration are probably the best thing about the game: being able to sail, find hidden treasures, do quests, missions, events, raids, main stories and so on.\n\n[*]The settings and the care with which the map is made are simply spectacular.\nThe sea, the day/night cycle, the sky, the stars, the aurora borealis, the atmospheric changes... it's all amazing, really. \n\n[*]Personally, I have always really liked the fact that the ship requires real management and that its efficiency also changes based on the capacity of the people on board, thus creating a unique and inimitable synergy between the members of the crew.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list][*]It's a big time sink.\n\n[*]The tutorial is incomplete and barely explains the basics, not at all preparing players for what really awaits them during their adventure across the seas of SoT.\n\n[*]The optimization, the netcode and the hitreg has only gotten worse over the years and the devs have never fixed it, just like the rampant problem of cheaters and bug abusers.\n\n[*]The game is scripted in such a way that as soon as you have some loot on the ship, megalodons, krakens, storms and whatnot start spawning all and only around your ship.\n\n[*]Personally I find that the ballistics of the cannons has gotten much worse over the years, it seems to be shooting 999kg cannonballs and always having to make absurd calculations to hit even at a distance of 50 meters.\n\n[*]The game doesn't have a way to \"defend\" new players from beasts with 3000+ hours on their back, so good luck minding your business and trying to learn the ropes step by step because there will be almost zero opponents of your similiar skill level resulting in a useless/frustrating experience most of the times.\n\n[*]The game is poisoned by a subset of chronically online players, who will exploit the game in every way possible to sink you, which they don't always do just to get your treasure. \nThey just do it because they want you to know that they're better than you since they play this game 18 hours a day and are using the latest strategies.\n\n[*]There's no need to try to sweeten the pill, like 90% of multiplayer games the biggest negative side of SoT is the community for countless reasons:\nEndless toxicity, extreme and unjustified tryharding by people who, if they don't bully/insult others heavily, have no way of curing the \"small pp\" syndrome they suffer from.\n\n[*]Grinding, grinding and more grinding.\nIt all costs too much, it's a constant grind even to buy a pair of pants, and having to do some missions three to five times to get a skin is just ridiculous, it's definitely the wrong way to extend the longevity of a videogame.\nAlso because after a while it gets repetitive despite the content that the game offers since, whether you like it or not, the things to do are always the same so even leveling up your companies becomes a sort of job.\n\n[*]Although you already have a small group of friends to play with (therefore having already overcome the first major obstacle that the game puts in front of you) the skill gap between new and old players is too wide, creating gatekeeping like on [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/304390/FOR_HONOR/]For Honor[/url] where if you are a new player for the first 300/400 hours (minimum) you have to get bludgeoned in the teeth then, perhaps, you'll start to understand something assuming your crew is willing to waste all this time to be able to \"have fun\".\nIn this game there is no middle ground: either you are a new player/casual player or a tryhard who has been playing religiously since day one and did nothing but PvP 24/7.\n\n[*]A [b]HUGE[/b] flaw of this title is the fact that the so-called \"solo players\" will have an awful experience in the vast majority of content that the game has to offer.\nManeuvering the ship, sailing, exploring, PvE components but above all the PvP part are terribly disadvantageous for lonely sea dogs or for people who want to spend a couple of hours making a more casual and relaxing game session... you are \"forced\" to have other people to fully enjoy the game with, and this is something I never liked.\nIf you don't already have a group of friends with the same goals as yours (be it PvP or something else) you are \nconstrained to go around the various Discord servers and socialize/group with complete strangers just to be able to spend a couple of hours profitably and even if you are willing to do that, the vast majority of what people are looking for nowadays is straight pvp and you better be experienced right off the bat or your not getting invited to play.

borderline do not recommend.[/h1]\nFull price - No. On Sale - Yes, but consider:\n\nInitially this game is amazing. Digging up treasure, fighting hordes of enemies, sailing your boat, levelling up factions rep, hunting or defending yourself from other players. With friends its a great game. Although others complain about the community and pvp, it can be annoying when on a quest but it is what keeps the game exciting. Especially when you and your friends are on a galleon being attacked by two sloops and a brigantine, its hectic, chaotic, but exciting. Trying to board the other players ships, taking on water, stressing over dwindling supplies after 1+ engagement, then finally sinking them only to be hunted by them again and finally be sunk. It's part of the game and can stop it from being stale.\n\n[b]The problem is the repetitive nature and loosing that initial charm of the game.[/b]\n\nAll quests can be summed up as follows: [u]Fetch quest.[/u]\nOrder of Souls - Go here kill enemy horde/ fleet, collect loot, return.\nGold Horders - Go to this island, collect pieces of map/ treasure, find next island/tomb, loot, return.\nTall Tales - Follow these clues, find this spot, collect treasure, done, return.\nMerchants - Take merchandise to island, sell, buy some more, repeat. \nReapers - Attack and loot everything and anyone, return.\n\n[b]Cosmetics:[/b] They are a grind to get, having to loot 100 tombs for cosmetics is ridiculous but a good bragging point. Otherwise there is MTX.\n\n[b]Problem with AI:[/b] Realistically mobs are stale. Most have very similar attack patterns and somewhat brain dead. Fortresses can be solo'd with ease. Mobs offer little to no challenge, even when they vastly outnumber you. The game does offer 'raid bosses' but they're basically a sponge.\nOn the water there's sirens again little to no threat, sharks, megs that just have different skins and the kraken (tbf kraken is fun).\n\n[b]Playing Solo:[/b] When you start you'll have a fun and almost zen experience: Sailing the seas, adjusting sails, exploring the horizon. But It can quickly become boring. If your in the wind heading to a destination there isnt much to do other than play an instrument or drink some grog. Pvp solo can be a nightmare esp when they're a brig or galleon attacking you, but if you enjoy the challenge you'll have a good time (it can actually ease the boredom). It is definitely a \"Fun with friends game.\"\n\n[b]Finally Community:[/b] Although I didn't mind a game of cat and mouse with the Reapers as a gold horder or the PVP aspect, other friends with me found it infuriating. Some players can be blood thirsty and chase you for hours on end and even after sinking them will try hunting you for the rest of your session. It can be good in adding a tense layer in your gameplay session, but what other friends noted is true: When your trying to mind your own business and just wanting to chill and do quests it was just wasting time. \nPeople have often complained about the community being offensive and racist, they're on there much like any server, but if they poked fun at me for having an accent I could just laugh it off. But some people will have an issue with this, so be aware. On the flip side there are some decent people on there as well, all first encounters normally are tense. But afterwards can be pretty chill, drinking and playing instruments, forming temp truces to sink a pvp ships with The Chest... Then either forming an alliance or sinking each other later on.\n\nIf the dev's add more content and variety. Especially with missions, and mobs this will be a solid recommend.

The developers only care about squeezing as much money from the game as possible while do little to support the base world with the engaging changes that the community has been asking for for years. \n\nDo not buy, you are worth more.", "timestamp_created": 1695381663, "timestamp_updated": 1695381663, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529915034770965576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130291556": {"recommendationid": "130291556", "author": {"steamid": "76561199104755696", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 401, "last_played": 1673115028}, "language": "english", "review": "The doctors told my granpa he had 1 hour to live and he still had time to do everything this game had to offer .There are barely any things to do and there are even sweats spawn camping in this game, imagine how much of a virgin you have to be to wake up every day in your miserable life and do the same things because let me say it once again this game has nothing to offer there are three kinds of missions that get repetitive really quickly .Furthermore there isn't even anything to grind for and unlock beacause most stuff you have to pay for .To sum up don't buy this game", "timestamp_created": 1673032973, "timestamp_updated": 1673032973, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529837250709533691", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129122028": {"recommendationid": "129122028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258034010", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 847, "last_played": 1671828608}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don`t love your life, this game is made for you!", "timestamp_created": 1671828598, "timestamp_updated": 1671828598, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529837250709533691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141817530": {"recommendationid": "141817530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820299011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 916, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1696325932}, "language": "english", "review": "Would not recommend it to other Steam users because you need friends to play this game and Steam users do not have friends.", "timestamp_created": 1689064411, "timestamp_updated": 1689064411, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529830098152160645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141796010": {"recommendationid": "141796010", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058655550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12390, "last_played": 1692327429}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a cheater problem, lots of bugs, requires playing for long periods of time to make any real progress, and its just so demoralizing when you sink and waste your evening.", "timestamp_created": 1689033458, "timestamp_updated": 1689033458, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529830098152160645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140074453": {"recommendationid": "140074453", "author": {"steamid": "76561199363964510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 75613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "playtime_at_review": 44364, "last_played": 1696122320}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of Thieves  has amazing game play.

It took some wonderful experiences queuing with strangers to unlock what I love about this game. Interactions with other players will always be unique and fun. Sometimes you'll find yourself struggling to stay afloat in a stressful, heart-pumping, naval battle, and then fishing peacefully off your boat in the next session. Sure, there are issues. The lack of anti-cheat makes experiences with hackers a pain and a half. Laggy servers cause a lot of pain: from hit registration not functioning to being stuck in menus you have to kill your fellow players to get out of, with the worst making the game physically unplayable. I've heard complaints from other people, and I have my gripes with the communities toxicity, but none of that has stopped me from playing. Then again, my idea of progress is much different than what the game advertises. Gold, glory, heart-hammering pvpve, and cool cosmetics are nifty, but I'm the type of player who enjoys looking up at the stars and lending a hand to new players.\n\nThe payoff of each session and the experiences I go through really do outweigh the negatives Sea of Thieves has, and with the Season 9 update, the seas have never been so lively and chaotic.

As an enthusiast of open-world games and cooperative multiplayer, I'm delighted to share my review of this one-of-a-kind pirate odyssey.\n\nGameplay (4.5/5):\nSea of Thieves stands out for its unique approach to cooperative multiplayer. Players form crews, each member taking on specific roles on a pirate ship. Whether you're steering the vessel, hoisting the sails, or manning the cannons, teamwork is essential for navigating the treacherous waters and engaging in thrilling ship-to-ship combat.\n\nThe open-world exploration is equally captivating. The game's whimsical art style and picturesque islands make for an inviting and immersive setting. Whether you're searching for buried treasure, solving riddles, or battling formidable skeleton crews, every voyage is an opportunity for adventure and discovery.\n\nCooperative Multiplayer (5/5):\nThe heart of Sea of Thieves lies in its cooperative multiplayer gameplay. Sailing with a crew of friends or even with strangers is an absolute delight. Communication and coordination are key to success, and the game encourages players to work together in creative and humorous ways.\n\nFrom the camaraderie of manning a galleon to the chaos of repelling a skeleton assault on an island, the shared experiences with your crewmates are what truly make the game shine. Whether you're sharing tales of your conquests or embarking on epic voyages, the social aspect of Sea of Thieves is a testament to its charm.\n\nVisuals and Sound (4/5):\nSea of Thieves features a vibrant and colorful art style that sets it apart from the gritty realism of many other pirate-themed games. The world is filled with lush islands, sparkling waters, and charming character designs. While the game may not boast the most realistic graphics, its visual style is a perfect fit for its whimsical tone.\n\nThe sound design is top-notch, from the creaking of your ship to the roaring of cannons during naval battles. The dynamic and atmospheric musical score adds to the sense of adventure, crescendoing as you engage in epic battles or serenading you as you explore the tranquil waters.\n\nContent Updates and Progression (4/5):\nRare has committed to providing regular content updates to keep the game fresh. These updates introduce new quests, challenges, and cosmetics, ensuring that there's always something new to strive for. The game's progression system allows players to unlock cosmetic items to personalize their pirate's appearance.\n\nWhile the game has come a long way since its initial release, some players may still find the progression system lacking in depth. However, the frequent content additions and events help mitigate this issue.\n\nConclusion (4.5/5):\nSea of Thieves is a swashbuckling adventure that excels in delivering a unique cooperative multiplayer experience. Its emphasis on camaraderie, exploration, and whimsical pirate antics make it an exceptional game for those seeking memorable adventures on the high seas. Whether you're sailing with a crew of friends or joining a group of like-minded pirates, Sea of Thieves offers an enchanting world where the journey is just as important as the treasure. It's a must-play title for anyone yearning to embrace their inner pirate and set sail for thrilling escapades on the open ocean.", "timestamp_created": 1695373604, "timestamp_updated": 1695373604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529042363166809082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147132419": {"recommendationid": "147132419", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072649584", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 624, "playtime_at_review": 2046, "last_played": 1696353660}, "language": "english", "review": "c", "timestamp_created": 1695826170, "timestamp_updated": 1695826170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135942124": {"recommendationid": "135942124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872102932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1680503665}, "language": "english", "review": "Very beginner-unfriendly.

I can sit on the deck of a ship or shore of the sea and just take in the moment and just lose myself in it's presentation.\n\nBut let's be real - this game's experience is not going to be for everybody. Because at the heart, this is a game were we are all pirates. And that means stealing, killing, swindling, and double-crossing. There is no PvP on and off switch, even with the new opt-in on-demand PvP they've released. People are always going to be out to screw you over. And not everybody is into that and it's okay.\n\nMe? I think the game would lose a lot if I lost that feel of always having to watch over my shoulder. And those funny moments with friendly players would mean so much less. Besides - I appreciate a good thief who can ghost my loot off my deck. When I realize somebody nicked a bit of my treasure without me noticing, it always makes me laugh and I raise a mug of grog in their honor as that's the kind of Pirate I hope to be.\n\nWith all that said, what carries this game for me more than anything is the soundtrack. Because let me tell you, I don't care how many different times they remix \"Warpath\" to thematically fit the boss fight I'm in, that track always manages to pump me up and get me ready to fight.

Too bad, you risk some randos who will come sink you & take what you need to hand in to complete your tall tale or chase you across the map even when told you're just doing tall tales.\n\nWant to just go around and do some emissary quests get a little bit of gold & rep? Enter some hackers who come up on you when you're fighting skellie ships and are able to INSTANTLY REPAIR their ship while being fired upon by yourself & skellie galleons.\n\nOr encounter highly skilled PVP players who you have no chance of fighting back against, or you might not even be in the mood to do some PVP but too bad. \n\nFor a bit it used to be if you saw another player you might be able to (cautiously) approach & make friends, but anymore you see another player and you have to instantly be 200% on guard and not trust anyone, which is really shit because it would be so fun to find other people to do the larger events or commendations with. \n\nAs long as you don't run into other players, you should have a decent time. \n\nRARE can you fix the cheating & hacking already & put in PVE servers?\n\n\noriginal review:\nI really enjoy the PVE elements of this game.

I jumped back in the game because of that added PVP matchmaking thing thinking that it would alleviate the problem, but it has not.\n\nI would not mind one bit if on the PVE servers if you got chased more by NPC skellie & ghost ships, maybe some new ships with the sea creatures or things like that depending on what you were doing & how many were in your party (just trying to solo a tall tale and get effed over by griefers IS NOT FUN). Also would not mind if you got more rewards if you decided to do PVE stuff on a PVP server (more risk more reward type thing).\n\nI just want to enjoy this game without having to deal with griefing little douchebags who have nothing better to do than chase you down and repeatedly kill you (even after a ship re-spawn!)", "timestamp_created": 1683289748, "timestamp_updated": 1690447964, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527728676795959473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145610815": {"recommendationid": "145610815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152391432", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 492, "playtime_at_review": 6916, "last_played": 1696537888}, "language": "english", "review": "Wealth.

Was constantly asked to play this game and eventually got it as a present, so I relented. I expected very little and was still disappointed.\n\n1) It's hard to tell whether you're playing with other players at all. We had no contact with any one for hours until suddenly our ship was stolen by another player who literally came out of nowhere (I know they were flown in via cannon). Fighting him proved problematic because the basic combat system lifted almost straight from Pre-1.9 Minecraft meant that there was no effective way of dispatching of a single trespasser, since we were out of bullets. Our ship got scuttled and we never saw them again. Last I heard from them was a \"gg\" and I didn't get a chance to return the gesture.\n\n2) The game's weather system was designed specifically as an anti-fun mechanic, as lighting can strike a player at random at any time they aren't under a roof. It happens seemingly at random so your best bet seems to just hide and wait. So when the ONE time both of us got struck at the same time, the game decided we were clearly \"struggling\" on our island loot run and scuttled our ship and sent us to a new island. By the time we got back and and found where our loot was, the items started despawning and we lost some of it. Absolutely infuriating, and absolutely unfair to us.\n\n3) It became painfully obvious quickly that this game doesn't care about any kind of vertical growth. Most of the things I could spend my gains of was cosmetics, most of which appeared to come in sets and was intended to be worn as a costume. This made earning money feel pretty meaningless.\n\n4) Combat is pretty bare-bones. A 3 swing combo with a sword or five shots with any of 3 different types of firearms. Not exactly inspiring, and certainly not ringing of any real swashbuckling feel. Most of our fights against AI just boiled down to stepping into deeper water, shoot at the enemy, and win without a struggle. Some enemies made very little sense in how the worked and were not very fun to fight at all.\n\n5) Player interactions seemed interesting at first, but the only encounters we had were kill on sight or both parties immediately avoiding each other. As a result, every safe harbour was a dead wasteland of NPCs offering services to sailors who would never see their shores. It felt like playing an abandoned MMO.\n\n6) The inventory system was scientifically engineered to be the worst possible inventory system conceivable. No weight limit, but a strict limit on how many of each item you can carry. Food being the worst restricted -- especially since the food items heals for different amounts. This meant that a lot of the time looting islands was a matter of emptying out the inventory before going on shore and hope you take as little damage as possible. And while there were special loot crates to help carry certain items, that just goes to show how bad it really is. Just give us carry weight or limited inventory slots, pick one or the other.\n\n7) The world is empty. Most of the time, the game is very quiet and most voyages are devoid of any real adversity off land. Aside from a random kraken encounter, most of the action was on land, against skeletons and ghosts. At least some NPC pirates/traders in the sea as shown in the tutorial would spice it up. Maybe they exist? But I certainly didn't see any.\n\n8) The puzzles. What on Earth is going on with these treasure puzzles? So many of these treasure hunts had us reusing the same landmarks over and over again for different treasure scrolls to get loot. And the progress is shared between players. In an effort to expedite this slog, we started spreading out over the island and solving clues that related to our side exclusively, meaning most of the time I only saw my crewmates when we were on the ship. While efficient, it was hardly immersive.\n\nAnyway, while I can say I had fun for most of the time I played, it was by and large only because I played it with someone I like and knew more about the game than me. I would never recommend this to a new player who didn't have a veteran to lean on going in. I may play this some more and check out some content I've yet to touch, but I don't see myself being a long-time player.", "timestamp_created": 1670992310, "timestamp_updated": 1670992310, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315808296203613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140443784": {"recommendationid": "140443784", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087806496", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1660499886}, "language": "english", "review": "sea of thieve (singular)", "timestamp_created": 1687357872, "timestamp_updated": 1687357872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526270449161529541", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133687591": {"recommendationid": "133687591", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043938962", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2237, "last_played": 1689535931}, "language": "english", "review": "The multiplayer experience:\n>Play with a full squad in a galleon\n>Just about to sell your loot\n>Fog hits you and visibility has reduced to zero\n>A sloop attacks you w/o warning and the galleon is too slow to counter it\n>A kraken attacks you at the same time\n>Respawn and get spawn killed repeatedly because enemy is literally camping in your ship\n\nSolo experience:\n>Same as above but this time, game really wants you to lose\n>Get hit with storm, kraken, skeleton ship, hostile/toxic players all at the same time\n\n2/10 massive waste of money if it's this unbalanced.", "timestamp_created": 1677437778, "timestamp_updated": 1677437778, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526254355907440186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145129450": {"recommendationid": "145129450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189590747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1337, "playtime_at_review": 7683, "last_played": 1696403761}, "language": "english", "review": "i love it\n", "timestamp_created": 1693142385, "timestamp_updated": 1693142385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526233375072479248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140405439": {"recommendationid": "140405439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021742087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "playtime_at_review": 2175, "last_played": 1696448120}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is full of toxic players that do nothing other than ruin your experience, spawn campers, ship sinkers loot stealers, its not fun it gets very old very fast", "timestamp_created": 1687290571, "timestamp_updated": 1687290571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526200711727142334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137347953": {"recommendationid": "137347953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361743500", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 907, "last_played": 1685860272}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most fun games that I have ever played, have like 100 hours on Xbox Game Pass and finally decided to buy it on Steam, worth every cent.", "timestamp_created": 1682555933, "timestamp_updated": 1682555933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526184558868408203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137345914": {"recommendationid": "137345914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171282118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 485, "playtime_at_review": 16235, "last_played": 1696263680}, "language": "english", "review": "There's nothing quite like this game.

I'll probably update this review the further I play. For now I'll be talkin about the Adventure mode :)\n\nPros :\n-Cool graphics and simulation of a pirate life.\n-It's a game where you either get addicted or hate it in the first hours.\n-Funnier with friends or randoms, but you'll learn so much faster in solo trust me.\n-Satisfying sensation when you sink ennemies boats and grab their loot.\n-Good game if you want to chill and kill time (but sometimes it can be stressful especially if you have a lot of loots and you're getting focused by a reaper or red flag emissaries).\n-Active developer team (monthly updates, quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeter, so I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of what's happening).\n\nCons:\n-Intensive grind.\n-Boring after a while.\n-Lack of content eventhough it was way worse back when it came out in 2018.\n-FPS optimization is a joke on islands (At full ultra I go from 120fps to 55 fps on big islands).\n-PVP mechanic is old and boring (idk maybe they need to add some new guns or mechanics).\n-Bugs after new updates are not even a surprise anymore.\n-Servers issues is normal and the community is used to it (so an advice would be to never do an event the day it comes out because you probably won't receive your loot's coins, XP and achievements).\n-Some events are only visible on their website and not in-game so sometimes you can miss them (Just stop it, we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our \u2665\u2665\u2665 in-game event progression, just put it in game already ffs it's 2020).\n\nOverall the game has a lot of problems but I still love the concept it does represent otherwise I wouldn't have reach one of the highest titles you can earn and I hope this game will continue to get the support it deserves. I haven't played such a great game in a while, so if you like intensive farming, bugs, coop and pvp but also the big map you're in the right place. We'll be waiting for you on the ocean :)\n\nPS: If you're a veteran please help new players and don't bully them, that's what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I started, so please do so they will always remember you, thanks fellow Legends.\n\n\n\n\nEdit1: So after 3 months, the game is still awesome, probably one of the best open world in multiplayer that I've played in a while. Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nights.\n\n\n\n\nEdit2: They finally added an Even tab in-game! Anyway I've been playing Arena, joined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog. So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game (adventure). It also have its pros and cons so here we go :\n\nFor the positive aspects :\n- Helps you improve cannon shots\n- Helps you improve your weapon accuracy\n- TDM (Team deathmatch) is a lot of fun! It's like the endgame community event in the Arena\n- You can make friends in this mode\n- Since the last Arena patch, there's only one chest now and it's way better than before\n\nSome negative aspects :\n- Hitregs (When you hit players usually with weapons and you have the hitmarker but the server didn't register the damage, so sometimes you'll need to hit 3-4 time the player before he dies, and sometimes you may think they're cheater)\n- Lobby waiting time : because the Arena mode is not the main mode, the playerbase is not that big here, so you might wait 10-30min in the worst case...\n- Server region merge : Yeah well sometimes there's no server in EU (in my exemple) at certain hours and I usually get matched with NA players and I have an average of 200-250ms\n- FPS optimization (Even on High-End PC you'll probably struggle to maintain a stable 144fps\n\nEdit3:\nThey removed their own game mode called Arena. I don't know if it would now be an interesting game for pirate that love to pvp...\nQuite a sad day for Sea of Thieves...", "timestamp_created": 1688897553, "timestamp_updated": 1688897553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139392080": {"recommendationid": "139392080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056793461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 27262, "last_played": 1695679787}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful and unique game full of adventures but with the typical flaws of pvp and its toxic community.\n\nI play SoT before the first season launched and return every now and then. It's a really adventurous game, filled with hours of fun, stuff you can archive, a lot to explore, good storylines and quests, events, riddles, fishing etc. Amazing game to play with friends and experience fun and wild stuff or (sometimes) to just relax and enjoy the whole setting of being a pirate.\n\nThe cons:\nSadly, as mentioned before... Sea of Thieves suffers a lot from its PvEvP concept in my eyes. Over the years i had enough encounters, which made me avoid playing it for a longer period, even deinstalling. It can get very frustrating, if you arent on the strong side of PvP skills and finding your joy rather in making friends and helping others, instead of stealing and srewing another player overf. My encounters with most PvP-Players so far, were more than disrespectful and highly toxic. From spawncamping, people laughing at you over voice, wild insults especially towards female gamers, getting ganked in a world events (like kraken, what is already enough struggle but makes you an easy target), people chasing you for literally hours over the sea and so on. I have the feeling, since they shut down the arena, it gotten even worse. If you go on reddit, you see people literally writing, that they play this game only to ruin someones day. To steal and win over someone, because \"its sea of thives not sea of friends\" after all. Many people don't even care about doing the PvE content and only feast on the people who do it, but aren't skilled enough to get their stuff back quick and safely.\nJust as many others, I wish there would be some way to make it more PvE friendly, since all the stories and world events are mostly PvE based. There is nothing more frustrating, than spending hours in this game, just to get invaded by some pvp pros and losing literally everything you did since you visited an outpost last. The constant fear as someone who isn't really comfortable with the clonky pvp system of shotgun and animation cancles, that dominates the pvp interactions, being robbed and losing everything i did the past hour is really frustrating and taking a lot of fun away. Even after watching guide over guide about pvp tricks, im sadly still a noob. I probably would have less of an problem with the whole pvp, if it would just be shooting canons at each others, but sadly 90% of the pvp people shoot themselves on your ship, anchor you, kill you in less than a second while using the thinnest character model to be hard to hit and then spawncamp you until they sank your ship. \nI really wish there would be a system that allows you to decide if you want to do pvp or pve. Like a \"warmode\" you can turn on and get way more rewards for everything you do on the seas. More gold. More exp. More rep. So its appealing to people. High Risk. High Rewards. And for the people who dont want to pvp, they can peacefully enjoy the pirate life without getting screwed over and over, even if it takes way longer without the pvp mode. But sadly so far rare doesn't really plan on doing anything like this afaik.\nNot gonna lie, if there would be another fun pirate game, i could play with my friends and just enjoy the world and PvE content, i would have left this game long ago. Sadly its the only one of its kind, so you stick by the toxic pvp people or forget about having a piratecrew with your friends.\nNext to the pvp aspect another \"small\" flaw is the character creation for some players. You can't really create your own pirate and need to decide between randomly generated ones. Most of them look really ugly, but you can spend hours on rerolling until you find some better looking one.\nAnd i want to mention, that a few of my friends, weren't able to play this game, since it caused motion sickness for them. So if you are weak on that spot, this might not be the right game for you.\n\nThe pros:\nBut ending on a lighter note. Just as you find a lot of toxic people in this game, you can also find a lot of friendly and fun fellow pirates aswell. The game gives you the option to form an alliance with other ships (which gives you about 50% of everything the ships in your alliance sell (way more profitable than pvp but people cant feel superior)). If you don't have anyone to play with, you can also join the official discord and get into a group with others and plan on doing certain content. I met some really nice people through this.\nThe graphics are still pretty damn fine and the water is AMAZING. The sailing itself is very fun, (when you aren't against the wind for once lol). \nThere are many things to do. You can farm gold, reputation, archivements & cosmetics (as in outfits, hair, beards, tattoos, weapons, ship and so on). There are several stories to play through, very well written and entertaining, even emotional. You always have something to do, like fishing, exloring, solving riddles and much more. The random world events are great and  very exciting, especially canon fights are insanely fun!\nThe game also has amazing soundtracks! A great atmosphere all in all.\nOne of the biggest pros about the game is that it keeps getting updated and improved, even after all this years. The Devs taking amazingly good care of the game. The ingame purchases are cosmetics only. The battlepass is always amazing and so generous. One of the few real chad-battlepasses in all of the games i play/have played, where you get something every level even without the cash version. \nEven if i have many shitty memories and frustrating encounters in this game, i keep coming back to it, because if you aren't getting completely clapped it is really a masterpiece in my eyes.

I think you could do a lot with a pirate game in terms of fantastical art and inspired designed. For instance a mimic enemy would be super cool, maybe a skeleton octopus? I don't know how that would work but it'd look really cool. This game really isn't tied down to historical piracy, instead its more of a fantastical setting so there shouldn't be any limit on creativity here.\n\nUhhhh the combat's a little dull, again it's very casual, and it feels designed by committee to be as lackluster as possible (mostly talking PVE here, not that other thing where you get hit and instinctively cram five pineapples down your throat to negate all coming damage.). I think if they added like...some snazzy mordhau style combat it'd be really fun, maybe even some whack ass guns like pepperbox revolvers, volley guns, all that. I think it'd be really nice if they made it so you could upgrade your ship and it would have an actual gameplay effect, it could be permanent and locked to a certain amount of slots to your ship, or upgrades you can mount as you go in a single session (ex: a ram, canon sights, armor plates, cool stuff like that.).\n\nMusic's great, some fun classics and also original music in there. Story's okay, but it could get way weirder and it'd be a good time. Most of the grand voyages I've played have been kind of dull, also questing is uh...yikes.\n\nQuestin is uh...kinda why this game is not for me, I get flashbacks to modern WoW. Like, we did a voyage for order of souls where it was a bunch of bounties that were on various different islands. Getting to each island takes a little bit, and you sit on them and fight wave after wave of skeletons, with some really annoying special subtypes spawning (metal) and some just neglectable ones (the nature guys with da leaves), and you kill these hordes to get to the...named skeletons, and kill them, and collect their skulls. Because of how stock the combat is this quest isn't really that fun. Uhhhm, then there's the gold hoarder equivalent where you...sail to a bunch of different islands using a magical compass, go on the islands, and dig up portions of a treasure map belonging to a specific island, which...yeah that's as fun as it sounds. It's not super intriguing it's just a chore to do. Finally, the third of these quests is the shipwreck cargo recovery quest where you try to sus out where a shipwreck is to retrieve its loot, in theory it's cool but in practice your friends'll read through the quest and just do it themselves leading to you just sitting on a boat being a chore-boy and having orders barked at you. Most the other quests are kind of iterations on this sort of thing unless it's a legendary voyage.\n\nMost of the time I played this game I got really bored and agitated that I wasted that much time on a game I didn't enjoy that much. I mostly wrote this because I just didn't want to think about this game anymore and finally just get my thoughts on it out.\n\nSo, it's a good game if you're not me, and you're fine with a game that's kind of lackluster in depth (funny because it's set in the sea). Also despite being kinda shallow it takes up 100 gigabytes on my computer, which uh yeah that knocks it down a few points.", "timestamp_created": 1684978910, "timestamp_updated": 1684978910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138716984": {"recommendationid": "138716984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198222879708", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1687822057}, "language": "english", "review": "top tier now", "timestamp_created": 1684702674, "timestamp_updated": 1684702674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138668098": {"recommendationid": "138668098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133851193", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 17904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17763, "last_played": 1690870074}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is pretty solid, and the graphics are amazing.

Oh, and be careful with a skeleton holding a barrel. I'd back up if I were you.\nThe players aren't all bad either, for example we got attacked by a sloop while under siege from the kraken, but we also had a nice time with a random player on an island that we both happened to be at.

But there are just as many who will sneak onto your ship with a rowboat full of treasure and supplied, change all your lanterns to be ghost lights, start playing music for you on your deck then shoot themselves out of your cannon before logging off\n\n(Also, my time in the game is much higher than it looks on here; i played a lot on the PC xbox app, and recently got it on steam because i figured that would be a bit more convenient to launch from; when i launched on steam i was hit with 33 achievements, so i can confirm that your achievements do carry over)", "timestamp_created": 1679258755, "timestamp_updated": 1679258755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316417217254639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126021261": {"recommendationid": "126021261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089317809", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1610741067}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game!!\n\nI suggest to all", "timestamp_created": 1669148207, "timestamp_updated": 1669148238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316417217254639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140368945": {"recommendationid": "140368945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052681335", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 2980, "last_played": 1696152172}, "language": "english", "review": "the worst part of sea of thieves is the community", "timestamp_created": 1687233671, "timestamp_updated": 1687233671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525298774242401123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137646297": {"recommendationid": "137646297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039086014", "num_games_owned": 2046, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1306, "last_played": 1689969647}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a super fun game where you can sail around the ocean with your friends and rob caravans! :D .

What I wanted was ship battles. What I got was endless boarding parties that drop your anchor. Where are the ship battles?\n\nThe PvE can be fun. The wife, kid, and I enjoy doing a few fortresses to gain some gold and supplies. What I enjoy about the game is what the game offers the least of and that is  the ship battles. \n\nWe got in 3 ship battles with skeleton ships today. The 1st was vs a sloop and we killed it easily and got the loot. The second was vs a sloop and a storm suddenly arose basically ending that fight. The 3rd was vs a galleon. The fight starts off enjoyable and then the fog appears. That added some tense moments of the galleon appearing out of no where which was fun and immersive. Then came the Meg. We sink the galleon and then have to sail off to escape the Meg. This day was probably the most fun that we have had even though it felt like the game was putting endless blocks in our path to obtaining loot.\n\nA normal day goes more like, hit 3 forts and hit an outpost to sell the loot. Reaper ship appears out of no where and isnt on the map and sinks you while your docked and running back to the ship. I am not sure why people find this part of the game enjoyable. Who enjoys taking 15 to 20 mins to run loot back and forth. Talk about monotonous. Id prefer that ships engage you before you reach port and actually have, you know, a ship battle. This game encourages you to avoid ship battles and look for easy prey which is mostly boring.\n\nWhile I do enjoy the ship battles, everything else feels like a time sink put in place to expose you. I dont want to unload goods for 20 mins. That isnt game play. Personally I would prefer semi protected outposts that defend docked ships. You want to gank people, do it on the open sea or at a fortress or world event or anywhere thats not an outpost. Also, less loot thats worth more. Turning in 20 items take forever. Especially the skulls and trinkets. Its so slow that I mostly just leave those items where I found them. Id rather turn in 10 items and save the 10 minutes so I can go back to sailing...\n\nAs a side note, my son plays on a steam deck docked at 1080p with a keyboard and it plays well. The only issue that we have is that it shows controller buttons.\n\nShrug...", "timestamp_created": 1666063558, "timestamp_updated": 1666293165, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524010300636291504", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131147888": {"recommendationid": "131147888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250206624", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2256, "last_played": 1674366127}, "language": "english", "review": "alot of fun with friends\n", "timestamp_created": 1674138357, "timestamp_updated": 1674138357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523999989032745361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147665844": {"recommendationid": "147665844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280364122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2703, "playtime_at_review": 2573, "last_played": 1696544731}, "language": "english", "review": "I listened to a child scream and cry while i watched his burning ship sink into the depths of the ocean.", "timestamp_created": 1696488629, "timestamp_updated": 1696488629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147657284": {"recommendationid": "147657284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882377917", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 1520, "last_played": 1696475510}, "language": "english", "review": "would like a private party server bc i dont wanna deal with 9 yr old krispy mic krack heads hunting down our ship like it's the last pouch of caprisun in a 105 degree F car", "timestamp_created": 1696472347, "timestamp_updated": 1696472347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147655485": {"recommendationid": "147655485", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972084586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 654, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1696544169}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has a HUGE learning curve and requires the help of experienced players and hours of youtube videos.

Thieves is a crewing game about treasure and sailing.  The treasure's value is likely worthless and the sailing mechanics aren't real but serviceable.  Oh and you can play 1-player but can't achieve anything doing that.\n\nI really want to like this game.  The theme is fun.  The graphics are basic but have some real beauty at times.  But the game play kind of sucks.  Or rather, anything but sailing around sucks and there's little to be gained just sailing around and anything you gain has a decent likelihood of getting lost in combat against players.  The combat itself unbalanced & janky against human players and slow & boring against the AI.  There's treasure to be gained at all corners of the map but worthwhile treasure is, at best, super obscure -- looking up guides is necessary.  And since gaining the treasure \"legitimately\" is so time consuming and risky, it makes PVP the strategy that is lowest risk and highest reward.  Which is where the primarily problem with the game -- the combat -- comes up.  It's really a pity too because some of the locales you can go to appear interesting -- ultimately barren or behind some lock -- but visually interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1695430029, "timestamp_updated": 1695430029, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146797048": {"recommendationid": "146797048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103624243", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1688701222}, "language": "english", "review": "piracy is based", "timestamp_created": 1695405478, "timestamp_updated": 1695405478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146673201": {"recommendationid": "146673201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031218395", "num_games_owned": 1063, "num_reviews": 153, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1640874280}, "language": "english", "review": "need to find a crew to play this", "timestamp_created": 1695247322, "timestamp_updated": 1695247322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146666336": {"recommendationid": "146666336", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970520898", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3844, "playtime_at_review": 1915, "last_played": 1696398277}, "language": "english", "review": "Great multi-player fun.

"language": "english", "review": "SOT can be a fun game. It's the only one I've managed to play so far that gives you the feeling of being a pirate. But it unfortunately suffers from not only being an online only game, but your only option of playing is a multiplayer. It does give the game a tense feeling whenever you see a silhouette of a ship in the distance and it doesn't have the lights of a skeleton ship. But that's because any time you see a player ship, they're either doing their own thing, or they're just there to fight you and NOTHING ELSE. I at the time of making this don't plan to go back in, but my last playthrough involved joining an alliance with 2 ships, going to the fort of fortune, and having a blast. And then a random sloop blew up some barrels we had, sunk our ship, and we lost ALL of our loot and our emissary level. This was my first time reaching emissary level 5.\n\nWithout an option for a private server or a true solo play, I personally can't enjoy this game anymore. This game is exclusively risk reward and it's almost never reward, unless you some minor voyages, and even then you'll be harassed by players AND AI. It's irritating sailing to an outpost and you get pattered by a skeleton galleon as a one person sloop, managing to get away, and now you're being chased by a skeleton sloop AND a Megaledon, only to be stopped by a Kraken right after and the Meg is still swimming around you. I JUST WANT GOLD, BUT I CAN'T WHEN THERE'S MORE ENEMIES AROUND ME THAN CANNONS I CAN PHYSICALLY USE!!\n\nIf you want to be some pirates with your friends, go ahead, but if you want a peaceful game, don't even bother.\n\nUpdate: I have heard about them adding private servers. But since it will be putting a cap on leveling up to 50, then it's not good enough for me. I'm already level 53 in Gold Hoarders, the only faction I care about.

This game is incredibly dangerous for burning your time.  Between the plethora of things you can do, the exciting tedium of captaining the ships, and the long journey through the daring seas.  You will find yourself playing for handful hours at a time.  \n\nThe pace of the game is rather slow and exhausting, but it benefits the game feel a lot.  There is simply so much to do.  It gives you time to chat, look at treasure maps and plan your routes, fish, play some songs and look around for random world events.  A Simple voyage to track down the whereabouts of a captain's shipment, turns into hours of side looting to stack as much of a payout as possible.\n\nIf I have 1 gripe, it's that pvp can be very exhausting.  Especially for newer players.  What was an incredibly cool interaction initially, became sour with how resilient a group can be.  As long as players are paying attention to the repairs of their ship, it can be incredibly difficult to sink another player's ship.  So pvp matches between two players can take literal hours.  Plural.  That stays that way until you realize that naval combat is more balanced towards putting pressure on the enemy, to then open them to being boarded, killed, and thus finally sunk.  pvp on foot is a little stale as it is balanced towards who can one shot the other person first.  You will just have to play to learn all the tricks and tools you can use.  It's just annoying how pvp can take a long time, and players can force that on you by chasing you endlessly.", "timestamp_created": 1690778301, "timestamp_updated": 1690778301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143068778": {"recommendationid": "143068778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198953521105", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 3849, "last_played": 1695566472}, "language": "english", "review": "kempiniukas", "timestamp_created": 1690704578, "timestamp_updated": 1690704578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143051669": {"recommendationid": "143051669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090148008", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 54877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2252, "playtime_at_review": 37342, "last_played": 1696452543}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok", "timestamp_created": 1690676261, "timestamp_updated": 1690676261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143036935": {"recommendationid": "143036935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198992397636", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6219, "last_played": 1692392611}, "language": "english", "review": "one piece in rl", "timestamp_created": 1690656223, "timestamp_updated": 1690656223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142987574": {"recommendationid": "142987574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397286371", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 5810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "playtime_at_review": 5683, "last_played": 1695484680}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5/5)\n\nAhoy there, fellow pirates! If you're looking for an exhilarating, swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, look no further than Sea of Thieves. Rare's masterpiece is a game that has captured my heart and imagination since its launch, and it continues to impress with each new update and expansion.\n\nSea of Thieves offers a unique and immersive pirate experience that no other game can match. From the moment you set sail on your majestic ship, you'll be enchanted by the stunning water and weather effects, which bring the open world to life in a way that feels both realistic and fantastical. The attention to detail in the game is truly commendable, and you'll find yourself lost in its beauty and charm.\n\nWhat truly sets Sea of Thieves apart is its emphasis on cooperation and camaraderie. While you can sail solo, the game truly shines when you team up with a crew of your fellow scallywags. Whether you're steering the ship, adjusting the sails, or manning the cannons during a heated sea battle, the feeling of unity and shared objectives is unparalleled. It's a bonding experience like no other, and you'll create unforgettable memories as you face storms, sea monsters, and rival pirate crews together.\n\nThe freedom to explore the vast open world is liberating. There are countless islands to discover, each with its own secrets, puzzles, and buried treasures waiting to be unearthed. The thrill of stumbling upon a sunken shipwreck, solving a riddle to find buried loot, or battling an undead horde in a cursed cave is an adrenaline rush that never gets old.\n\nHowever, be prepared to face other pirates who might not be as friendly as your own crew. PvP encounters can be intense and nerve-wracking, but they add a layer of unpredictability and excitement to the game. Trust me, there's no greater satisfaction than outmaneuvering your adversaries in a thrilling sea skirmish.\n\nThe developers have done an excellent job of supporting the game post-launch, constantly introducing fresh content and meaningful updates. From new trading companies and commendations to the addition of majestic sea creatures, the evolving world of Sea of Thieves keeps players coming back for more.\n\nOf course, no game is without its flaws, but the overall experience of Sea of Thieves far outweighs any minor shortcomings. The community is generally friendly and welcoming, and if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find plenty of pirates willing to lend one.\n\nFair winds and following seas, me hearties! \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1690589334, "timestamp_updated": 1690589334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142939212": {"recommendationid": "142939212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198857232163", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1714, "last_played": 1694998834}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1690529704, "timestamp_updated": 1690529704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142924199": {"recommendationid": "142924199", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064362656", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 4332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4226, "last_played": 1690518440}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of thieves, we sailin' with the team\nWe're headin' up north as far as the eye can see\nWe're carefree, we have no need to flee\nI hit a skeleton with my Banshee\nSea of thieves, we sailin' with the team\nWe're headin' up north as far as the eye can see\nWe're carefree, we have no need to flee\nI hit a skeleton with my Banshee\n\nI'm gettin' the loot and doin' the dash\nWent to The Wilds and took all the cash\nWhippin' the sloop and I almost crashed\nSaw a monster and I turned it to ash\nHit the outpost, I count up a band\nGot twenty gems right down there in my hand\nBlunderbuss, don't go on my land\nTry to step up, boy, I don't give a damn\n\nSea of thieves, we sailin' with the team\nWe're headin' up north as far as the eye can see\nWe're carefree, we have no need to flee\nI hit a skeleton with my Banshee\nSea of thieves, we sailin' with the team\nWe're headin' up north as far as the eye can see\nWe're carefree, we have no need to flee\nI hit a skeleton with my Banshee", "timestamp_created": 1690503027, "timestamp_updated": 1690503027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142917845": {"recommendationid": "142917845", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099102681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1496, "last_played": 1691805743}, "language": "english", "review": "good game\n", "timestamp_created": 1690493355, "timestamp_updated": 1690493355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142884623": {"recommendationid": "142884623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174386313", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1665886135}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish i could favour this game more because it is fun between map searching and sailing and the pirate music, but you literally need a group of dedicated friends to play it, every time you join in everyone leaves because you're too low level but no one will stay long enough to level up I got lucky once or twice and found some groups that let me play but it was often one and done.

The attention to detail in the environments, from sandy beaches to stormy waters and lush tropical islands, creates an immersive experience that captivates players from the moment they step aboard their ship.\n\nThe heart of Sea of Thieves lies in its cooperative multiplayer mechanics. Players can team up with friends or strangers to crew a pirate ship, each taking on distinct roles such as steering, navigating, manning the cannons, or repairing the ship. This teamwork aspect fosters a strong sense of camaraderie and adventure, as players must communicate and coordinate their actions to navigate treacherous waters, face off against deadly skeleton hordes, or outmaneuver rival pirate crews in exciting ship-to-ship battles.\n\nMoreover, the game's sandbox nature allows for emergent gameplay, ensuring that no two adventures are ever the same. As players explore the vast open world, they encounter unpredictable events, like chasing down a legendary sea monster, stumbling upon hidden treasure maps, or unraveling mysterious riddles to uncover buried loot. This unpredictability adds a sense of excitement and unpredictability to every session.\n\nSea of Thieves also embraces a \"play your way\" philosophy, granting players the freedom to pursue various objectives at their own pace. Whether you prefer engaging in combat, hunting for treasure, or simply enjoying the thrill of exploration, the game accommodates different playstyles, making it appealing to a wide range of gamers.\n\nIn summary, Sea of Thieves is a captivating and visually stunning multiplayer experience that transports players into a swashbuckling world of piracy and adventure. Its cooperative gameplay mechanics, beautiful art style, and open-world exploration make it an enjoyable and immersive gaming experience.

The main downside for some people is that the game heavily relies on PvP, which, in my opinion, makes the game better.\n\n\n~ Storyline ~\n\nThe game itself is based on doing voyages and/or battling other crews for their loot. This means there is no real storyline in the base game but rather in \"Tall Tales\", which are a separate part of the game where you complete missions to unlock exclusive rewards. With this in mind, you don't have to go through the storyline, but it's rather a fun thing to do on the side of normal gameplay.\n\n\n~ Difficulty ~\n\nSea of Thieves is a game that heavily relies on PvP but also some PvE; this means that there will be a big skill gap between the players who tend to fight other crews and the PvE enthusiasts. I know this will annoy some people, but in my opinion, the game is made for pirate interactions: stealing, fighting, etc. Some may say that it's not kind to steal someone's loot, but in the end, that is what the game is all about.\n\n\n~ Graphics ~\n\nThe game has stunning visuals, sound effects, and creatures. Sea of Thieves has a very good art style because it fits perfectly into being a pirate while also not being too realistic to not look like a game. Since the game has so many details, the storage space required is a lot more than for many other games, which brings me to my next point: PC requirements.\n\n\n~ Requirements ~\n\nAs mentioned in the graphics section, the game requires quite a lot of processing. This means that you will need a pretty good PC to run it. You can find the exact requirements on the store page under \"System Requirements\".", "timestamp_created": 1689534927, "timestamp_updated": 1689534927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142220597": {"recommendationid": "142220597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998761435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1649564085}, "language": "english", "review": "Piloting the ship around and navigating is fun as hell\n\nThat is all.", "timestamp_created": 1689534423, "timestamp_updated": 1689534423, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142219509": {"recommendationid": "142219509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033929381", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1781, "last_played": 1679177128}, "language": "english", "review": "An awesome game with many great memories.

NO my internet is not dogshit, I have played with friends in NA and ping stability is chef's kiss.\n\n I am CRYING for a server selector so I can play in NA servers by my own... but nop... Rare doesn't want you doing that. Reason as to why I'm asking for a server selector is because since the south american player base is so small... brazilian players always team up with themselves... if they find out you are not brazilian or you don't speak portuguese they IMMEDIATELY target you. For the record I don't mean \"target you\" as in going against you in PvP but they would shout racial slurs 24/7 until you sink or decide to scuttle your ship. According to their logic I should kill myself for not being brazilian like????? and you can't even report this... The only report options you have are for \"insulting named ships/pet/player names\"...\n\n I take it as if Rare doesn't care about toxicity in their game whatsoever, YES! you can mute... but that doesn't mean they are not insulting others or you.\n\n I am posting this review after 200 hours (mostly of me solo slooping) and this terrible experience has happened to me more than 90% of the time that I wanna play the game. AGAIN I am not complaining about losing fights as a solo slooper, I am complaining how the devs allow this type of behaviour with no punishment whatsoever.\n\n Friendly reminder that this game is rated PEGI 12...\n\n Now for the times that I've had the wonderful opportunity to play on NA servers, it has been a blast, the game just works completely different!. I now that NA has toxicity problems as well... but since SA has a smaller player base... yeah... is just terrible dude...\n\n- NOW! the cheating problem... HOLY MOLY is UNREAL the ammount of people that cheat in this game, specially PvP Hourglass... from teleporting to walls to fixed cannon aim to even being immortal... and boy O BOY! you cannot report this... of course... Now... I thought that MAYBE you can report this in the forums with video evidence but nop... posting about it is actually forbidden in their forums LIKE WHAT?! so... people can just cheat and be the most racist peaces of shit with NO REPERCUSSIONS! wow... just amazing...\n\n I'm honestly scared to see how cheating can escalate to the point where they can mess with your PC, I'm begging we don't reach that point but still...\n\n -Solo slooping experience... is... terrible!, the game punishes you for being a solo player... even if you are really but REALLY! good at it... is not worth it... the ammount of effort you have to put for a small reward is unreal... is just tedious work... even if you don't wanna engage in PvP is gonna be a miserable experience...\n\n If for some reason... you still decide to play this game alone... good luck friend... that's all I can say...\n\n -Playing with friends or people you know, sure! is actually really fun with friends the only thing that is just not fun at all... sweatlords... basically people who have NEVER stopped playing the game and that for some reason take the game too seriously... but other than that you are set to enjoy the game and what it has to offer.\n\n Keep in mind that the game doesn't have a system that puts you with/against people that has like a close \"skill level\" to yours so... yeah... you are gonna find that no life player just farming casuals all day long. This not only applies to normal adventure mode but for PvP hourglass as well... which... is weird since hourglass is supposed to be THE place if you wanna engage in PvP but I'm telling you... farming hourglass PvP is... not fun, is not casual friendly, for some reason people are REALLY competitive about it... and no... there is not even like a leaderboard for wins or something like that...\n\n Reason as to why I'm posting this review in english is to raise awareness to a bigger population of people, sorry If my grammar or use of the language is terrible but as you may have noticed english is not my main language. Sorry for such a big wall of text but I just cannot comprehend how a game is rated for such a young audience and not being safe at all... you are basically paying money to feel bad about yourself and just feel miserable, while people just hack like there is no tomorrow while being really toxic...\n\n Thanks for reading (to those who actually did) and stay safe!", "timestamp_created": 1689385833, "timestamp_updated": 1689385951, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142098271": {"recommendationid": "142098271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141400910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1692164344}, "language": "english", "review": "SUPA HAPPIE FUN TIME YAY", "timestamp_created": 1689383389, "timestamp_updated": 1689383389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142090928": {"recommendationid": "142090928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198998439478", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 370, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1695973777}, "language": "english", "review": "It's got a little kick to it", "timestamp_created": 1689373311, "timestamp_updated": 1689373311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142088495": {"recommendationid": "142088495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147258278", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2236, "last_played": 1690547154}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't recommended\n\nsingle payer is not  recommended. this game have not anti cheat. cheater love this game.\ncheaters  need this game.,  if you want enjoy a  game ,choose another game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1689370456, "timestamp_updated": 1690169957, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142083014": {"recommendationid": "142083014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297081450", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4075, "last_played": 1689917934}, "language": "english", "review": "It gets repetitive, but it's a nice grind game, and the content they do add is always cool.

So as a relatively new player myself, my best advice is to simply play it to have fun. Do not focus too much on your failures. You will have a lot of them. Just learn from them and see them as part of the adventure. And if a situation becomes too heated or stressful, simply set sail and get the hell out of there. You might not get away, but you owe no one anything in this game, and if a situation isn't fun, just leave it behind and go do something you enjoy instead.\n\nThere are no real ways to progress in the game beyond cosmetics. That's both a pro and a con for the game. A pro since it means all players are on the same level. A con since the game lacks any sort of character progression towards getting better equipment or skills. There is none of that. So it relies entirely on the sense of wonder and adventure. But know that it is REALLY good at that stuff. So you will have plenty of fun stuff to do simply by playing, learning, playing and learning.\n\nYou will meet other players who look like mean bastards. But at the end of the day they carry the same weapons and cannons as you do. The difference is experience. So you will probably get beaten up by some of these guys. Other guys might just leave you alone. There seems to be some sort of unwritten pirate code among the more experienced players, but they are completely voluntary. I'm still learning about that stuff.\n\nOne thing I have to note is the insanely creative ways this game is designed. I won't spoil anything, but you will happen upon some really cool stuff that takes place all around you. The world feels very much alive. And it is pretty much the perfect pirate experience. And the looks of the game and the music and audio is absolutely brilliant. It's just perfect in my opinion. Running around with that fat loot sounds just right.\n\nI'm glad I only just started playing the game in 2023. There is much more content nowadays than at release. And it really helps that feeling of adventure that there are soooo, soooo many things to do.

Be ready to make alliances with others but then get betrayed because you can still attack alliance ships and members. Especially be ready to face a load of cheaters who hit every shot, who fill your ship instantly with water and who play with godmode because they are dogshit in real 1v1s. Don't expect to have any fun in this game because even if you do some world events you always have to be scared that some speed hackers literally go full sonic and catch you. Did I mention the story mode that also plays on the normal servers? No? Then read this review again so you know what will happen to you. I really hope the devs stop being dumb childs and finally give the players good and also rewarding PvE servers. Maybe lower the gold and xp down to like 50% idc as long as it still gives rewards (as it should be) and its full PvE without any chance to get griefed.

Rare has created a game that balances the tranquillity of sailing across beautifully rendered oceans with the high-stakes thrill of pirate combat, all while weaving in threads of exploration and discovery.\n\nSea of Thieves offers an open-world multiplayer experience set within a beautifully crafted seafaring universe. You can sail solo or assemble a crew of friends to navigate your ship, search for treasure, and engage in combat with other players or the game's variety of NPC enemies. This sandbox-style gameplay gives you the freedom to live out your pirate dreams on your terms.\n\nOne of the game's most commendable aspects is its naval mechanics. Sailing is not just a mode of transport but a fully-fledged part of the game. The attention to detail in handling your ship, from raising and lowering sails to angling them for optimal wind catch, navigating using your compass and map, and patching up your ship when it takes damage, all contribute to an incredibly immersive seafaring experience.\n\nThe game\u2019s combat, both naval and on foot, is intense and rewarding. Whether you\u2019re firing cannons at an enemy galleon, or engaged in swordplay and gunfire on a sandy beach, the combat in Sea of Thieves is always exciting. It might seem straightforward at first, but there's depth to it, especially during the larger battles where strategy and communication with your crew can mean the difference between victory and a trip to the Ferry of the Damned.\n\nThe graphics and art style of Sea of Thieves is another high point. The game is visually stunning, boasting a unique, painterly art style that perfectly captures the romantic allure of the high seas and the lush, mysterious appeal of unexplored islands. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle also deserve a mention, as they significantly contribute to the game\u2019s atmosphere. Sailing under a starlit sky or in the middle of a storm is a sight to behold.\n\nAs for sound design, the game does an excellent job of immersing you in its world. The ambient sounds of the ocean, the creaking of your ship, the distant roar of a cannon, all add to the overall immersion. The shanties you can play with your crew are a delightful touch that adds to the camaraderie and fun of the game.\n\nThe game's questing system, represented by voyages and tall tales, provides a wide array of objectives for you to pursue. Whether it\u2019s treasure hunting, bounty hunting, or cargo delivery, the voyages offer varied gameplay. The Tall Tales, on the other hand, serve as the game's main storyline quests. They're filled with puzzle-solving, exploration, and exciting lore about the Sea of Thieves world.\n\nOne area where Sea of Thieves may polarize players is its lack of a traditional progression system. While you can acquire cosmetic items and reputations, there are no upgrades to your abilities or stats. This ensures an even playing field where skill and strategy reign supreme, but it might not appeal to those who prefer a more tangible sense of character progression.\n\nLastly, the social interaction in Sea of Thieves is something to highlight. The game fosters a strong sense of camaraderie when played with friends and even encourages interaction with other player crews. However, be prepared for possible encounters with less friendly pirates.\n\nIn conclusion, Sea of Thieves is a rich, immersive, and beautifully crafted game that captures the spirit of piratical adventure. It is a game that doesn\u2019t just allow you to play as a pirate - it truly makes you feel like one. Despite its minor drawbacks, its breathtaking world, exhilarating combat, in-depth sailing mechanics, and fun multiplayer interactions make it a game I wholeheartedly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1687932118, "timestamp_updated": 1687932118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140830222": {"recommendationid": "140830222", "author": {"steamid": "76561199375969541", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2650, "last_played": 1686491554}, "language": "english", "review": "Personal favorite painting style, from the first season to the sea, whether it is solving puzzles or exploring, has a unique taste.

Half the Tall Tales (story quests) are easy modo sailing grinds whilst the other half are literal on-rails theme park rides.

If you want to make bank you'll be doing World Events but most of the long-term game progression is built around grinding Voyages instead. I'd like to see some kind of late game gold sink.

After 5 sessions and somehow accidentally playing 6 hours straight and staying up way to late last night I can say this game is a lot of fun.

Still much funner with family/friends.\n\nI will warn people though this is a open world sandbox PvP game so that includes all the fun that comes with that.

At that time, I made this thing walk my NVMe's plank for two reasons: 1. the PVP and II: the fact that it's still 90 god damn gb. I wanna talk about the first thing, tho much noise has been made of the PVP experience in SoT already and there's not much useful that yet another casual Tall Talesman could add to this.\n\nThe last time I played this game, my ship got sunk while moored off of Thieves' Haven. Major crime, right, 3-month noob sinking an unmanned ship isn't big shakes; for the guy who sunk me, tho, it seemed to be free therapy. And what followed that was... I don't even know how to describe it, behavior that one would never see in any other game (except for possibly the aforementioned Rust, but even then?) Like, if it just stopped at basic slurs, one could just chalk it up to typical small dick hijinks and leave it at that. But yeah, it was incomprehensible stuff (and he really only called me something once, with the epithets not getting much worse than \"retard.\") Thing is, I left that game silently after that, not quite sure if my last outing in Sea of Thieves was shared with a potential fucking school shooter. It was weird and haunting.\n\nSo sack up, bitch, right? Quit being a pussy and go get another boat and quit ruining the experience for the rest of the sweats! \"It's called of Sea of Thieves and not Sea of Friends,\" you might be thinking to yourself, when you're not wondering what uncovered boobies actually look like. Yeah see, here's the thing: I have a friend who doesn't let his kid play TF2 because of an experience he had where he was told to murder himself; to me, who's been part of the notoriously \"toxic\" TF2 community since W was in office, this is just another round on Dustbowl. But he'll let his kid play SoT without supervision, and has done so since he was 9 years old? 8?\n\nTo call the Sea of Thieves player base \"toxic\" is to undermine the potency of arsenic, but the ESRB lists this game as OK for Teens. It is not. Which means it certainly isn't OK for younger children.\n\nThe reaction to the \"Safer Seas\" update is more than telling in this regard: PvP players calling Hunter's Call and PvE players the \"actually toxic ones,\" accusations of Rare \"killing the game by splitting the players\" and, most ironically - yet predictably - PvP diehards balking at the idea of having to engage with [i]only other PvPers on an open server.[/i]\n\nSo why is this still a thumbs up? Good question, and I hope this serves for a good answer: Sea of Thieves is a good game what's only negative quality is its own cannibalistic player base. Rare can make all the claims to amends that it wants to, but that's a cultural problem no amount of chat filters and server segregation could ever fix.\n\n[i]Original re-edited edit[/i]\n\nAbsolutely couldn't stand it the first time I played - at worst, Rust but with cartoon pirates and 3 guns. Bad luck led me to experiencing Sea of Thieves' \"at worst\" right off the bat [i](edit, Sept 2023 - lol so young, so innocent)[/i]. Why no, Captain, I do not like anal; not without proper introductions, anyway.\n\nPlayed it years later with actual people, amounting to a completely different experience; and then I learned to solo, which elevated the whole affair to sublime. How? Couldn't tell you, unless you were also one of those weirdos that got off on just aimlessly sailing in Wind Waker. IYKYK.\n\nThere's good shit here, but you should start with some good people to find it.", "timestamp_created": 1683603463, "timestamp_updated": 1695403167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138019626": {"recommendationid": "138019626", "author": {"steamid": "76561199216748578", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1016, "last_played": 1693871108}, "language": "english", "review": "aye aye", "timestamp_created": 1683582595, "timestamp_updated": 1683582595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138009796": {"recommendationid": "138009796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198721851931", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1950, "last_played": 1692636390}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently finding the ONE PIECEEEE", "timestamp_created": 1683568593, "timestamp_updated": 1683568593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138009085": {"recommendationid": "138009085", "author": {"steamid": "76561199052810891", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8305, "last_played": 1689535700}, "language": "english", "review": "TOP", "timestamp_created": 1683567617, "timestamp_updated": 1683567617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138008971": {"recommendationid": "138008971", "author": {"steamid": "76561199443642273", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1209, "last_played": 1691683181}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of Thieves is a unique and immersive multiplayer pirate adventure game that offers a fun and engaging gameplay experience.

"language": "english", "review": "Sea of Thieves is a unique game that provides players with the ultimate pirate experience. While the game may have its faults, it has a charm that makes it a worthwhile addition to any gamer's library.\n\nOne of the standout features of the game is the ability to buy your own ship. This wasn't always an option, and it's a great motivator for players to grind for cash and earn their own vessel. Owning your own boat makes a real difference to the way you play, and adds a sense of ownership to the game that's hard to beat.\n\nHowever, one thing that could be improved is the combat system. While the game does offer the option to fight in 1v1 battles using the hourglass, it's not the same as engaging in normal battles on the open sea. Too often (in open sea), other crews will start to run away, leading to a frustrating half-hour of chasing them around with little opportunity to engage. Some crews even resort to playing dirty, with one member jumping in the water to anchor and kill you repeatedly, without ever engaging in cannon battles. It's not exactly fun, and feels like a waste of time for everyone involved.\n\nAnother problem is the option to run away and destroy your boat at the end of the map. It's disappointing to engage in a fight, only to have the opposing crew destroy their ship at the edge of the map, taking all their loot with them. While they may lose their loot, you're left with nothing, making it a frustrating experience. It's a shame to see this happening so often, with crews destroying their ship just to prevent others from getting their loot.\n\nDespite these issues, Sea of Thieves is a game that captures the essence of being a pirate. The graphics are fantastic, with sailing under the northern lights or just before nightfall providing a breathtaking experience. The story, however, could use a bit more effort. There's a lot of potential for more in-depth storytelling, and it feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nTo improve the game, it would be great to see PVE zones where crews can't kill you, giving new players a chance to have a better experience. Rather than gamers asking for a private server for people to play on, this would be a great start. It would also be useful to have a countdown for being in battle, to stop other crews from baiting you into combat just to flee into PVE zones at the last minute.\n\nOverall, Sea of Thieves is a fun game that's worth checking out. While there are some sour apples in the community, there are also plenty of nice and chill players who make the game enjoyable. If you're new to the game, I would still recommend giving it a try, despite its flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1683111121, "timestamp_updated": 1683111121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137702000": {"recommendationid": "137702000", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082614006", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1193, "last_played": 1693865483}, "language": "english", "review": "Will forever be one of my favorite comfort games.\n\nThe water graphics mwah! \u2665\nI hope they explore more into captained ships & customization I would love to have more furniture (plants!!!!!!! aquarium??)", "timestamp_created": 1683066234, "timestamp_updated": 1683066234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137700753": {"recommendationid": "137700753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169994943", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1941, "last_played": 1655577799}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me sea sick, 5/5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1683064336, "timestamp_updated": 1683064336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137696672": {"recommendationid": "137696672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192909011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 15420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3642, "last_played": 1686812008}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1683058694, "timestamp_updated": 1683058694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137666999": {"recommendationid": "137666999", "author": {"steamid": "76561199135073020", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1694718742}, "language": "english", "review": "i can just play songs while my friends who know what they\u2019re doing are actually playing the game and i love that", "timestamp_created": 1683019482, "timestamp_updated": 1683019482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137649649": {"recommendationid": "137649649", "author": {"steamid": "76561199183006883", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1686850508}, "language": "english", "review": "I crash into rock", "timestamp_created": 1682985840, "timestamp_updated": 1682985840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137648204": {"recommendationid": "137648204", "author": {"steamid": "76561199272507005", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 760, "last_played": 1691964882}, "language": "english", "review": "This game I hope lasts a long while because it really is a good game it has an element of you are in a world separate from ours do whatever you want.

In my opinion, the game has some potential but lacks in the basic multiplayer features department. The ability to have a server selection or a list of players currently in the server is missing. The game has three types of players: The hackers, The try-hards and the newbies. The problem with this, unlike in other multiplayer games, is that if you're new to the game, a level 1000 4 person galleon can and will destroy your sloop in seconds and steal all your hard earned loot. I was expecting to have some skill based servers but there is no such thing! \n\nEven worse, the game desperately needs PvE or at least some private lobbies or even skill based lobbies. But no, instead the devs decided to announce that they give no f's about PvE and they have black-listed any and all posts about the PvE situation. Reddit has also been affected. With any posts titled with \"cheating\" or \"PvE\" or \"toxic community\" simply being removed by the moderators. This is fueling the sweats and the cheaters ways of doing things. The steam discussions have also been censored to black-list any \"PvE\" mentions.\n\nNow, to the topic of the toxic community... Any mention of this is also censored. What I did notice, is that while the community is the worst I have ever encountered, nobody seems to be saying anything about it. You can fact check this yourself, look it up, reddit, steam discussions, f'ing twitter. No mention of any toxicity. And if there is some mention, it is likely not viewed by many people, as somehow, the mods and admins censor these kinds of posts.\n\nI realize that this is a MP game and that the thrill about it is the constant feel of danger, but damn is the cheating rampant. From instantly destroying your masts, to cannonball aimbot, to auto repair of ship hulls, to one-shot any guns, to even boarding out of thin air. How can a MP game not have any anti-cheat or reporting system??? It's dumbfounding that the game has progressed this far.\n\nThis is my two cents on the game and the community. Do not buy this game unless you are intent on PvP and getting your ship sunk a lot. If you do buy it, good luck.\n\nAlso, small addition to the review, I tried posting on Reddit about the horrible things I mentioned earlier. The post was uploaded, immediately removed, and then the account was banned from the server. No warning, no nothing. Straight ban, with no way to appeal or report the mods. This is getting out of hand. i hope somebody does something about this because this is unnaceptable amounts of censorship for no purpose.", "timestamp_created": 1682548685, "timestamp_updated": 1682550656, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137343151": {"recommendationid": "137343151", "author": {"steamid": "76561199258034204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6535, "last_played": 1680728044}, "language": "english", "review": "There needs to be servers for people with rationality aka servers with pvp off.

And the worst player I've seen wanted the same but for 39. The friendships you can make with your crew though are pretty amazing I once met this dude from Germany who was just the most precious guy ever. The community is so diverse and amazing but I feel like the competitive aspect of it ruins the game for most people and $40 for a game that you could get sick of after only a few days of playing it kiiinda sucks. \n\nI'm a guy who loves talking with people and having fun in groups. This game gives me so many opportunities to do that but having the aspect of someone randomly coming along screaming racial slurs like they're in anti civil rights protest in the 1950's It just... ruins it.

I need to vote yes or no only but i have no choice. After a billion of hours on Sea of Thieves on the microsoft market i decided to buy it on steam too. But recently the game annoy me more than ever. \n\nI take a long break of one years or two the last time beceause of personnal problems and beceause of the FOV who made me feel nauseous (FOV 90 is really to weak let us augment it on xbox and pc at least up to 100 or 110.)\n\nI try to love this game and give it my time... But after 2 hours of farm in solo (I didn't have any friends) i just got harass by someone who just never miss is shot from a boat to another. My mind said \"Is pretty good at the game\" and then i saw how he lead is boat and how he always now where i am. And i got this for a lot of session. Didn't know if thats was cheating or other but thats was annoying. \n\nThe game was simplified for people who sails alone recently, but trying to fight back a cheater or one(or two) good pirate is really hard. The game give me only 80ms and sometime have insane lag spike and goes to 100ms. I see people teleport and more... In other games my ping never go above 20ms. I tried to check on google, reddit and more but its seams to be server problem. So i didn't know, thats make the game unplayable for fun or solo. And i love to sails alone in the sea.\n\nTo resume : The most annoying problem for me is the server lantencies, the cheaters and, at the end, the FOV. I didn't care to fight with people, it's the part of the game but it need to be at the same level. Im not an experimented pirate, but did i need learn the impossible for just get a little bit of fun in the game?\n\nLike i said, i got really good times on this game back in the years and i want to get my fun and my love back.

I was so early that I remember when the ship's grog barrel had a limit.\n\nI still remember my first time playing Sea of Thieves. I must have been thirteen at the time, and I didn't realise that I was accepted into the Alpha program until the very last day I could play. My parents were out that night, so I convinced my sister to let me stay up until midnight so I could play. I had a blast just sailing around and digging up treasure on my own. When the betas came around, I remember playing them from the second I got back to school to the second I went to bed. When the game finally came out, a time where closed crews didn't exist and where forts took 3 hours to respawn, I remember I went fort hopping with random people I found on looking for group. I remember when the megalodon event happened which required 5 separate people to summon, and so for the first time I saw crews working together, with 5+ ships all huddled round shark bait cove. I remember making friends from those looking for group posts, and eventually joining a community called the BRN where I sailed daily, and met so many great people. I have years worth of great memories of people from just this game alone. Sadly, as I burned out and stopped playing, and the years went by I lost contact with most of those I used to play with, but I will forever be grateful to Sea of Thieves for everything it has done for me. It has sparked my love for multiplayer games which led me to joining a dark rp community, a great foxhole community and later on an amazing Project Winter community, many of who are still my friends to this day.\n\nThis doesn't mean to say that this game doesn't have problems, it actually has so many and I will never stop complaining about them, but if you are looking for an amazing multiplayer game, hop in and do some pvp.

However, there is no way of turning off PvP or having private servers, which I imagine is fine for most, although I have no interest what so ever in PvP and it is constantly ruining my experience.

These missions provide opportunities for character development, obtaining new items, and experiencing new adventures. Additionally, the weather conditions play a significant role in the game, making each game unique.[hr][/hr]Overall, Sea of Thieves is a great game for those who love pirate adventures and sharing them with friends.

The ocean's utterly gorgeous, and sailing can be pretty peaceful. There's no real limit to the silliness and chaos you can get up to, except where other players are concerned. The PvP system as it stands at the time I'm posting this is 50 shades of terrible, and it always has been. That's added to how utterly toxic and outright miserable most of the player base seems to be - I've been playing this game for years and I can count on one hand the number of truly friendly encounters I've had in game. Most players shoot on sight and are only out to ruin your day, they don't care if you have loot aboard, and always ignore alliance offers. Considering we're playing a pirate game centered around finding loot & making as much bank as possible, that seems mighty idiotic. There needs to be more in place to balance things out, as the game is tipped heavily in favor of the more toxic play styles. I'd honestly give the game a solid 8/10, because it's not the game that's bad. It's the community that's an absolute dumpster fire.\n\nI know it won't happen, given Rare seems to exclusively cater to the PvP crowd, but PvE servers would be lovely to see. It'd allow for a more laid back, relaxing sailing experience, less stressful and all around more enjoyable for those looking for a less intensive session, and for those who like to listen to Audiobooks and the like while they play. I'd even take it if they established it with only 50% of the usual rewards for PvE encounters, I'd just like to have the option to sail without the risk of a bunch of troglodytes attacking everyone on sight just for the hell of it.", "timestamp_created": 1679469766, "timestamp_updated": 1680400868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135139457": {"recommendationid": "135139457", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112733174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1681654627}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is soo good i cummed 5 times every hour", "timestamp_created": 1679456778, "timestamp_updated": 1679456778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135118308": {"recommendationid": "135118308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815448952", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 13550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13541, "last_played": 1684422639}, "language": "english", "review": "gaming-garantie", "timestamp_created": 1679426761, "timestamp_updated": 1679426761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135115665": {"recommendationid": "135115665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893774234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2023, "last_played": 1688437275}, "language": "english", "review": "water gaming", "timestamp_created": 1679423651, "timestamp_updated": 1679423651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135113735": {"recommendationid": "135113735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839906737", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2416, "last_played": 1692930956}, "language": "english", "review": "best game", "timestamp_created": 1679421503, "timestamp_updated": 1679421503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135089144": {"recommendationid": "135089144", "author": {"steamid": "76561199128727339", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3192, "last_played": 1695206625}, "language": "english", "review": "mnen", "timestamp_created": 1679396881, "timestamp_updated": 1679396881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135086155": {"recommendationid": "135086155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198429235506", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1679930433}, "language": "english", "review": "\" I THINK IM BOUT TO STEAL\" -

There are a lot of good players out there, but the toxic ones too. I think toxicity in this game makes it actually more realistic. Bad people exist in our worlds, and we know that, but so in this game. You can do adventures solo and with people, and still enjoy the game, though I recommend players to play with friends. Yes, this game based of cosmetics, but the point of them is self-expression. You can flex on people with skins, and that's the whole point, people start to respect you (or the opposite).

This is game is really good. The sailing system is simplistic enough to make it enjoyable, but also somewhat realistic when it comes to how waves and winds affect your vessel. The story's good overall, the gameplay loop is also fun, though some factions can be more boring than others (looking at you, Merchant Alliance, personally I don't have a problem with sailing in a circle around the map and paying attention to demands and supply, but it can be boring for most I think).\n\nNow, a warning. There's a lot of \"pirate\" pirates out there. A lot of people come into this game expecting to be an adventuring rogue. Which is fine, by the way, and I do that too. However, you HAVE to be able to fend off other players if they decide to attack, which eventually someone will. This involves a bit of \"Generational Trauma\" as well, as a lot of these currently 'Toxic Reapers' were once the victims of last generation's 'Toxic Reapers'. I guess it kind of is by design by the Devs. To be honest this game is best played with a friend, I think.\n\nThere are \"Alliance Servers\" where they all work together to farm gold and such, but as a lot of players say about these servers, you don't really learn how to stand up for yourself that way. Unlike some other players, I don't regard Alliance players as lesser, it's simply their way of finding enjoyment in this game, and that's totally fine. Too much rules and regulations for my liking though, some of these servers.\n\nI have some hope for future addition to the game; bounty systems, more factions, privateering and so on. Hopefully these things get added in the seasons to come.\n\nFair wind and calm seas to whoever choose to sail the Sea of Thieves.", "timestamp_created": 1677146840, "timestamp_updated": 1677146840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133396766": {"recommendationid": "133396766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280939814", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1678707861}, "language": "english", "review": "w game", "timestamp_created": 1677126058, "timestamp_updated": 1677126058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133390349": {"recommendationid": "133390349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961519545", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14471, "last_played": 1678838986}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to associate Disney with fun, paradise, and vacation...

The game's stunning graphics and immersive sound design create an incredibly realistic and detailed world, making it feel as if you're actually setting sail on the open sea.\n\nOne of the game's greatest strengths is its multiplayer gameplay. Whether you're playing with friends or with players from around the world, the game's social elements are an integral part of the experience. Sailing the seas with a crew of friends is an absolute blast, and the game's co-op mechanics ensure that everyone has a role to play and is able to contribute to the success of your voyages.\n\nHowever, the game is not without its flaws. The game's progression system can feel grindy at times, and there is a lack of direction for players who are new to the game. But despite these drawbacks, the game's overall charm, beauty and excitement make it an enjoyable experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Sea of Thieves is a must-play for fans of pirate games and anyone looking for a unique and exciting multiplayer experience. Its immersive world, stunning graphics, and social gameplay make it one of the most engaging games available on the market today.

This game is amazing to be an absolute piece of garbage to other players and to be the spawn of satan, It\u2019s so fun!!!! You really get to see the true nature of people in this game! But seriously if you play this game, get ready to get backstabbed, chased, terrified, and get your will to play taken away! Other than that this game is extremely fun to play. There\u2019s so much to do in the game it\u2019s unreal. You can customize your pirate, ship, weapons, and pets!! and there is a lot of customization in this game. Mostly from playing the game and buying it but you can also earn it from doing commendations. Other things to do involves quests, forts, world events, tall tales, PoTC stuff, and more.

If that isn't your cup of grog, you will NOT like this game.\nBut NO ONE can deny that the atmosphere is so unique. The artstyle (which may take some getting used to for some), the GLORIOUS music (can you tell I like the music?), the different regions (except the Wilds, eff that place), the slight ambient music (again, the music), the different fashion designs and player expression, it all blends together beautifully. So while SoT definitely has it's shortcomings and the... pretty bad advertising of what this game actually is, chances are, if you've stuck around for a year or something, you're sticking with it to the end.

The gameplay loop is pretty simple. Load up your ship and your crew, pick an emissary, sail to your objectives, turn in for money. Rinse and repeat ad nauseam. The teamwork is fun when you get an experienced crew, and the combat feels \"beefy\". the weapons feel like they have some real weight to them, and they have a high skill ceiling. Finding loot is easy, but keeping it away from other players is the hard part.\n\nNow for the negatives. The biggest issue is with stability. I had to drop my graphics to minimum to avoid constant crashes. The networking is terrible, and I've never seen my ping below triple digits for any significant period. The voice chat, which is arguably the most important feature in such a fast-paced, team-oriented game, is riddled with bugs that make it unusable. My mic sounds fine over discord and when I test it, but in game it sounds like I am under water. My friend's mic was fine one day, and stopped working entirely the next day despite hearing each other clearly over discord.\n\nOverall it's a fun game, and being able to play cross-platform is nice. However, I expected much more from a software company with such legendary status as Rareware. This feels like a pre-release late beta that still needs polish, not a full-fledged game ready for launch. It's a lot of fun that needs a lot of work.\n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1673726106, "timestamp_updated": 1673726106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130844494": {"recommendationid": "130844494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983604271", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 27248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2303, "playtime_at_review": 23504, "last_played": 1696544867}, "language": "english", "review": "she's not perfect, but this place is our home!", "timestamp_created": 1673718696, "timestamp_updated": 1673718696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130823928": {"recommendationid": "130823928", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044912054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 23916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1201, "playtime_at_review": 3426, "last_played": 1696444212}, "language": "english", "review": "yar har", "timestamp_created": 1673698013, "timestamp_updated": 1673698013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130819547": {"recommendationid": "130819547", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034647808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1674223962}, "language": "english", "review": "great adventure!! good graphics!! ahrrr!!", "timestamp_created": 1673692678, "timestamp_updated": 1673692678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130819412": {"recommendationid": "130819412", "author": {"steamid": "76561199196396530", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 17260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 2300, "last_played": 1696187051}, "language": "english", "review": "pirate game go brrrrr, i have 300 hours btw on xbox", "timestamp_created": 1673692523, "timestamp_updated": 1673692523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130806718": {"recommendationid": "130806718", "author": {"steamid": "76561199388480909", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 140, "playtime_at_review": 1661, "last_played": 1696511165}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of Thieves is a fantastic game that offers a unique and immersive pirate experience.

Even sometimes screwing around and doing \"reverse reaper\" fun, like boarding someone else's docked ship with a loaded supply crate and just leaving it on their capstan, because fun is fun, and as long as you are having it, the game is a great experience. Sure, sometimes you end up outplayed, sunk, and have to start over, but often times (especially recently with the 2022 winter sale happening) players who are either new and still learning, or just looking to have fun. It is nice to spend a little time and teach them the ropes and some more advanced tactics, and then see them put it into practice. Not even 24 hours back, our crew found a brand new (under 1 hour) player who was looting barrels on an island without a supply crate, he didn't know any better. We gave him an empty, showed him how to stock it, and even dropped a spare supply loaded with cannonballs before leaving him on his way while we do more captain voyages for rep building. Is this always going to happen? No. But when it does, it reminds you that games are worth playing, because not everyone is out to kill you all the time.

They\u2019ve added story based quests known as tall tales and recently have started a second story in the tall tales. There is also extensive lore.  You can fish or hunt animals, kill the Kraken, fight skeleton ships, or kill the Megalodon. You can explore regions such as the shores of plenty a caribbean like place, the wilds a more stormy and darker version of the shores of plenty, the ancient isles a old region of the map with extensive lore and huge islands, the devil\u2019s roar- a fiery tempered place full of volcanoes and earthquakes, and finally if you do the last tall tale you can have access to the lucrative shores of gold the biggest island in the game with huge chunks of lore and a lush environment filled with deadly traps, a skeleton lore known as the GOLD HOARDER a wicked skeleton held together by gold and lust for riches, and as the mighty pirate lore would say A GREAT BIG PILE OF TREASURE! There are also pets in the game but those cost money or if you play the game for a while skeletons might show up that carry this elusive currency known as ancient coins which buy you pets. If pvp is what you want head over to the arena where you and other ships compete for treasure and get into constant battles. They\u2019ve also added a tutorial known as maiden voyage for new players which (if the search hard enough and do some challenges) can give you some gold doubloons(used to buy from the bilge rats) and some ship cosmetics. There are also fun challenges in the game giving by the bilge rats who are wild and carefree like sit in thrones made of bones, shoot skeletons carrying gunpowder, find Easter eggs, and carry chests of rage.

Compared to everything else, voyages are not very fun by yourself or with friends. However combat is still very fun. World events are fun to do by yourself or with friends. PVP is hard, annoying, and just not fun when you start playing. However when you accept the fact that PVP is an essential part of the game, it gets very fun and exciting. Hourglass PVP introduced in season 8 is a great way to get better at it. I'm by no means good at PVP but i have gotten way better at it and I no longer run from every ship I see. \n\nIn short, great game.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

sailing mechanics, puzzle solving, and world events.\n\nUnfortunately, if you want to make progress, you either have to be intensely focused on pvp, or you will suffer for your crimes of wanting to have fun. This includes leaving people to sit on the boat and keep an eye out for other players, forced to do nothing while everyone else has fun and enjoys the content, because the moment you leave to join them, you will get attacked, and sunk before you can get back to the ship. The \"excitement\" that comes out of the constant risk of being attacked by other players quickly turns to stress and anxiety when you realize any attempts to avoid pvp will result in you just sailing aimlessly for hours while ships chase you. Because pvp players will chase you for literally hours just to attack you, whether there's loot or not. No one wants to spend hours collecting things just to have them all stolen last minute by someone who logged on 10 minutes ago and decided to choose violence.\n\nThe game exists in a bad spot right now, and while there will surely be tons of people saying \"Git gud\" or \"That's just part of the game, don't whine about it\", these are generally the people who have thousands of hours in the game and are far more experienced than you. The reason they say this is because without you there for them to attack and downright harass, they have to go against actually competent crews, and then they have a risk of losing, and they dislike that. The PVP players get rewards for sinking PVE players, and stealing their shit, but the PVE players get nothing from sinking PVP players, who just loaded their ship up with materials for fighting and no loot. This is the imbalance in Sea of Thieves. The reason the devs won't add PVE or private servers is because all the people who do content and enjoy the game casually will go to them, and no longer have to worry about the assholes griefing them to no end. When they do this, the PVP players will have no one to play with but each other, and when they aren't able to pubstomp every solo slooper they come across, they'll get bored and stop playing.\n\nThe game is heavily advertised as \"living your best pirate life\" and experiencing adventure, finding treasure, fighting battles on the sea, yadda yadda, but what they don't describe to you is the paranoia that comes with just existing in this game. It's advertised as PvPvE, mixing both, and the devs will say \"Oh, but if we take away the pvp, then you won't have the fascinating feeling of wonder about that ship on the horizon! Will they be friendly? Will they be hostile? You'll never know until you get close to them and find out!\"\n\nI'll save you the trouble. They're hostile. We've had literally one ship that didn't immediately bombard us while we were doing an event, and after talking with them, we learned they were pretty much in the same boat. They wanted to play the events, but were tired of pvp jagoffs ruining their good time. This is not a PvPvE game. This is a PVP game, and anyone who says otherwise is lying to get you to play it so they can take your shit. \n\nIf you wanna do an event, you can, but the moment you're done with it, that reaper galleon is gonna come out from the nearby isle, destroy you, and take all your things, because they don't want to play the game, they just want to get the rewards. What's that, you took the time to fight a whole fort of skeletons and beat the boss, and you just wanna have your rewards for a grueling session of combat? That sucks, because the athena's chest in there is too valuable for literally anyone to give up, so you'll likely be sunk before you even get the vault open.\n\nThere will of course be people arguing against this review. \"If you don't wanna fight the person chasing you, scuttle and go to a different server.\" \"Git gud, and then you won't have to run\" \"It's just part of the experience, don't whine so much\"\n\nAs I said, these are the people who have played for far longer, and have no qualms about finding a fresh faced little slooper, all excited and ready to go on his adventure on the sea of thieves, sinking him, and shouting at him over the mic that he needs to go kill himself for being a trash person and a trash player. These are not the kind of people you want to pander to, because they are the kind that will kill the community for the game, slowly but surely, until no one remains, and the game that had decent potential to it, dies with it.\n\nI cannot recommend Sea of Thieves until the devs finally add a safe area for PVE players to just enjoy the game, because no one wants to have to go treasure hunting and be constantly looking around like a paranoid lunatic to make sure they aren't about to have their ship sunk while they're solving a puzzle.

(you WILL be sunk with loot, and more and more HOURS will be spent with NOTHING to show for it) \nOr you won't and you'll stick with default skins, in which case there's no reason to keep playing unless you have friends who play, you like to RP, or you're REALLY into pvp.  \nOverall, it is not a bad game, I've had my fair share of fun times with friends and (rarely) randoms, but the general toxicity and the ease with which you can lose hours of progress make it a no unless you have a strong guide and a solid mental state.", "timestamp_created": 1668639614, "timestamp_updated": 1668673968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125594811": {"recommendationid": "125594811", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078301468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 417, "last_played": 1650308750}, "language": "english", "review": "yummy doubloons", "timestamp_created": 1668637272, "timestamp_updated": 1668637272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125594270": {"recommendationid": "125594270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881956151", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7145, "last_played": 1695322892}, "language": "english", "review": "day 69 of waiting for them to add slave trading..", "timestamp_created": 1668636493, "timestamp_updated": 1668636493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125564550": {"recommendationid": "125564550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976051452", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3143, "last_played": 1650545772}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a really fun game to play with your friends.With a huge map and lots of things to do", "timestamp_created": 1668593002, "timestamp_updated": 1668593002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125550416": {"recommendationid": "125550416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354701370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "playtime_at_review": 4887, "last_played": 1696207450}, "language": "english", "review": "Steal that fricking treasure before the treasure steals you.

Even better if you have friends to start playing with. [/b]\n\nThe water physics is astounding; the graphics is simple, yet great and detailed; everything that happens for the first time is fun and startling, such as your first random PVE encounter or your first storm; it has a lot of PVE and PVP as well, making it perfect for everyone; new updates every few months always add something to do or to unlock and if you look at the developers' plan, there still is a lot of content that will be added in the future; also, there is a story, a lore, which i cannot tell you about simply because there are so many things you can do in the game that i didn't even finish the second chapter yet (I spent 400+ hours just fooling around with my friends)!\n\nSometimes you might get a bug while logging in or loading something which is caused by a sync issue between your Steam account and the Microsoft one (you need it to play the game), but you can easily fix that with the guides on Rare website. \n\nThat said, about the gameplay: the game itself is fairly easy on beginners as long as you don't encounter some sweaty PVP lords, and even if you meet them in the server, you can still start a new adventure and have fun again. You don't necessarily need to be competitive.\nHowever, there are some bugs, but they are those kind of bugs that can give you and your friends a good laugh when they happen. SoT is a bit grindy if you aim to unlock all achievements, can't lie about that, but that's definitely not needed to enjoy the game as you own every piece of equipment since the start. Every unlockable is just for looks. It might get a bit repetitive in the long run, but after not playing it for a while, you will certainly miss it and will want to sail again.\nIt's an awesome game to play with friends, but you can play it alone and still have a lot of fun, in my opinion. Maybe you can even get to make some friends along the way. It might be a bit tricky at first but it will still be really enjoyable and once you master the art of the \"solo sloop\" you will get everyone's respect (surely mine) and your name will mean fear in

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.\nEventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore.

But the real fun is when the adventure is shared with others.  \n\nAt the start, you begin in the world at one of the many outposts to visit. Here you meet factions that have certain themes around making gold in the game. Gold hoarders are classic pirates we see in media stereotypes, Get a treasure map, search for gold and loot and bring it back to get your reward. Order of a Souls are a group dedicated to the PvE section of the game, Slaying skeletons, taking down spectral pirate ships and hunting down evil ghouls and there is also the Merchant Alliance, which is all about travelling across the seas making deliveries to certain npcs, just gotta be careful with dealing with the good. Bring it in best condition to maintain the best income.  And then if you want to live truly like a pirate, You join the Reapers Bones. A group of pirates who hunt down anyone and everyone, even themselves and make profit in the taking down of other ships at sea and their loot. \n\nIf thats not your thing, thats fine. You can simply go where ever the sails take you or where ever you want and explore the world. There are over 70+ Locations to visit and there is so much to discover, Any loot you find? Take it back and sell it to make gold. The gold you use in the game can be used to purchase cosmetics for your self, your boat and even all your equipment\n. There is currently no \"Buy to win\" items so everything is purely cosmetic. However, if you can't be bother doing all the grinding? You can purchase coins with real money to buy unique cosmetics that help you stand out from others. But it needs to be mentioned that there are some cosmetics that you simply cannot buy, you have to earn them. \n\nGrinding is enjoyable and it doesn't have to be such a grind either. There's special commitments you can make to factions where you become an emissary and during this time, you raise a flag on your boat stating to others you are working for this faction. The benefits of this is all context related items and jobs for the faction grant you extra gold. The more work you do under the flag, the more bonuses you get. Great to commit to if you have a hour or two free and want to have a big impact in the game. Catch is, The more stuff you have on your ship, the more you have to lose! So make sure if you're going to do this, make sure you sell what you find and know when enough is enough, otherwise some nasty reapers are going to visit you and take full advantage of your hard work. Its a classic risk vs reward and fortune only favours the brave!\n\nIf you want something with a bit of structure and backstory? There's a section know as Tall Tales, these missions are a selection of stories that you and others can play to earn some gold as well as uncover the stories in sea of thieves. You will travel around the world and visit many locations as well as engage in various puzzles and riddles too. These are great with friends and they sometimes feel a bit like the old school 90s games which as you all know, I really love. \n\nUnfortunately, the game does have a good handful of bad eggs, some players will straight up go out of their way to give you grief, destroy your ship for no reason other than their own entertainment. Trolls some would say, but you are always able to fight back and there's so many ways to fight enemies that you and your crew will most likely work something out when it occurs, You win some, you lose some. In a game full of pirates and a sea of thieves, You know what you're signing up for. So be prepared. \n\nBut the best part of this game? The moments and stories it creates for you to share with your friends and keep forever in your memories. \n\nEvery. Time. You play...  \n\nBecause , Yes the seas can be cruel with trolls, monsters of the deep and unfortunate weather conditions but when you meet friendly players who are happy form an alliance and share loot, sit and have a chat about anything while fishing or get totally drunk in a tavern and play shanties while throwing up on each other. These moments of fun and glory is what will stay with you when you finish. For all the horrible moments that can occur, you will easily outweigh them with the great moments this game consistently creates \n\nSunrises on clear weather, finding that epic treasure in a vault, laughing with randoms on the server, Catching a trophy fish, Slaying that Kraken, Revenge on a reapers faction, showing off your new clothes, Cooking a shark to perfection, playing the entire 1812 overture with cannons. What have I missed? I'm not sure but in this game. You will create your own. \n\nDo what you want cause a pirate is free and you can feel that in Sea of thieves. The complete package of a Pirate PvPvE\nI've currently got 110+ Hours and I cant wait to throw in more.  Craziest thing was I had this game in my library at the end of 2021 and never touched it. Boy, do I regret not playing this earlier. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1666840000, "timestamp_updated": 1666840000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It definitely takes some practice to get good and master all of the ship movement and the combat mechanics. The main sense of progression comes from your crew developing better strategies and mastering the combat. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nPvP ship combat is the best part of the game, by far. Which is a good sign for a pirate game. The game caters to PvP and PvE players although PvE seems to get a lot more love from the updates. Unfortunately they removed the Arena without providing any sort of alternative. My pitch for a good replacement is to let players pick the 'density' of their server. High density servers (more player ships) would get a loot multiplier but obviously come with higher risks. \n\nAs it stands, players are thrown onto a pretty big map with 3-4 other player ships. There are several mechanics you can use to find other players but it is pretty common for other players to flee (which is fine, part of the game) meaning that it can take time to find an engaging PvP fight. For PvP inclined players expect to spend a lot of time chasing and a lot of time sinking ships not paying attention. But when you do find another ship looking for a fight, it's worth it. Fighting another skilled crew ship-to-ship is one of the best, most exciting co-op experiences you'll find. I just wish it happened more often.\n\nLand combat is pretty rough. The movement is fine, the weapons are okay, but they are missing some obvious QoL things that make many of the land-based boss fights tedious. The biggest issue is that there are bosses that take 2-3 players 15+ minutes to kill and there is absolutely no progress indicator. No health bar, no visible damage to the boss, etc.\n\n[b]Progression[/b]\nThe progression is lacking. I understand not wanting to give ships with 100+ hours some massive advantage over new players but it seems like there is a lot of middle ground between that and what they have which is basically just cosmetic progression. That being said, their cosmetics (esp. the premium ones) are beautiful. Their art department is fantastic. \n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nGame looks amazing. The graphics are really really good, the water looks incredible.

But, alas, my view of the game skews more negative than positive. So here we are.\n\nIt's a tricky thing to articulate. As to why I feel more negative. Is Sea of Thieves a good game? Arguably, yes. But if you are like me, it's one of those games that flips constantly between being the best experience of your day, or the worst. And the reason for that, is other people.\n\nBefore I get into any of this, because I know already there'll be people getting their feathers ruffled and preparing a slew of \"It's Sea of Thieves, no Sea of Friends\". Look over the store page. Look at the trailers. Look at ALL the promotional material for the game. How much of it is focused on PvP? The two minute trailer that plays automatically on steam as of (18/07/2023) has three 1-2 second clips of ships vaguely firing on one another. The entire rest of the trailer is dedicated to voyages, quests, and crossover content. You see the Gold Hoarder themselves, skeletons, megalodons, and so on. But you don't see PvP.\n\nHow is this relevant? You might ask? Because I feel like I have been miss-sold on the game. I was promised a fun pirate adventure, I saw battles against skeletons and krakens, raiding temples and vaults for treasure, having fun with friends. I was not informed, however, that all of this would be interrupted frequently, by the large number of players that would spend their time spawn-camping your ship and screaming racial epithets.\n\nSea of Thieves, to me, doesn't create the fun, adventurous atmosphere I would associate with a game set to the theme of the Gold Age of Piracy. It creates an atmosphere of constant stress. And this atmosphere promotes a \"Shoot first, ask later\" type of paranoia between all players. I've sailed the seas for just shy of two hundred hours. And in that time. I've had maybe one, or two positive encounters with another crew. This, in Rare's mind, makes all the other negative instances worth enduring. The idea of chasing those elusive and surprising moments where another crew raises a mug rather than a rifle. I don't think this is worth the cost.\n\nRare has no intention of allowing people to customise how they play. It's a \"You play by our rules or not at all\" mindset. You are required to engage with open PvP. And if another player decides they're going to attack you. There's nothing you can do about it beyond either fight, or quit. I tend to opt for the latter, myself. I'm only here to fight skeletons and dig up treasure with my buddies. Not scrape against the emaciated PvP Lords that have forgotten what sunlight is during their 48 hour binge session, chugging Mountain Dew like a fish in water.\n\nIf you can tolerate all of the above, there's a fun game in here. Buried beneath the sludge of toxicity. If you don't mind spending a few hours digging up treasure, only to lose all of it through a chance encounter with an extremely experienced player, you might find some fun. I for one can mostly look past it all. But that's because I never particularly cared for the loot. I play for the fun of sailing. If, however, you're the type to get too attached to your loot, or absolutely hate the idea of your time being wasted in any capacity what-so-ever, then give this game a hard pass.\n\nEDIT (21/07/2023)\n\nI see this argument floating around a lot, on the forums, on the subreddit, and in the comments of this review. So let me address it.\n\nPeople often say that without forced PvP loot would have \"no meaning\". This is daft. Loot is already \"meaningless\" because it can only be used for cosmetic items. All handing in loot does for you, is give you a little bit of permanence between sessions. (The only thing that doesn't get reset when you log out, is your currency and reputation). But this \"meaninglessness\" doesn't make it not worth doing. Otherwise I'd not have invested near 200 hours in the game.\n\nAnd it's not like you can ONLY lose loot to other players. If you're not stocked well, you can still sink to PvE encounters, most likely losing all of your goodies.", "timestamp_created": 1689678215, "timestamp_updated": 1689931894, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523052453994750977", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129575839": {"recommendationid": "129575839", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970724214", "num_games_owned": 1426, "num_reviews": 176, "playtime_forever": 1730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1730, "last_played": 1624790653}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting game that is forced to walk to plank with bad hit registration, not to mention an array of bugs and exploits that are in heavy rotation in normal encounters. Players pick from an assortment of uggo pirates to control as they crew ships and scour islands with an assortment of tools and activities seemingly dumped right out of an abandonware \"pirate survival\" game, with the same degree of detail you'd expect from a 2-6 person dev team in constant \"omg uni finals brb\" flux. \n\nEvery pirate tends to be a quantum object in a superposition state of both \"here\" and \"not here\" when you aim just about any projectile at them. These have been \"known issues\" for five years; one of the recent fix ideas was \"hitscan weapons\" but it doesn't seem like that every rolled out. It is only every manageable when the server you're on has a low population (which is tied to ships, up to 5 per server, with 1-4 crew per ship). I am starting to think that not addressing it is on purpose, as [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is cross platform, and without the miasma of Schr\u00f6dinger's hit registration it would be likely that playing with a controller would simply be Eye of Reach fodder. \n\nOther bugs, like sword lung jump, also regularly get upgraded to \"features\" since they don't fix them. However, to find out about it, you either have to have someone tell you or have it used against you, since it's not a touted in-game mechanic. Honestly, it feels like some sort of weird ass [i]Battletech[/i] or [i]Warhammer 40K[/i] situation where some generation of devs is trying to service something they did not create and have no idea how to improve.\n\nShip control and ship-to-ship combat is fun, but it's not like I haven't played [i]Guns of Icarus[/i] before. The ship systems themselves are fine, and repairing the ship definitely works as core bedrock for crewing a ship that takes hits. The main difference from similar games is that there's combat on foot, which is absolutely woeful, seemingly locked in the limbo of mid-2000's game design and in execution. It's almost like having a stable connection is a detriment. The upside is that combat is such a joke you can't really feel like you won or lost... aside from your time, that is. It's hard to be invested in a coinflip sim. The distractions outside combat are scant. Digging up chests trades it's adventurous feel for a bureaucratic \"these aren't worth doing\" fairly quickly, and otherwise highlights for interacting with the environment boil down to looting containers for things to repair, rearm or heal yourself with. With the fighting itself being joyless, the fun boils down to the equivalent of MMO players that stand in one of the game's capital cities all day: emotes and playing insturments. There is less \"game\" in [i]Sea of Thieves[/i], both in \"ship-to-ship\" and \"hand-to-hand\", than [i]Star Citizen[/i]. Let that sink in.\n\nThe main form of \"progression\" is earning gold by collecting treasure. It's sole purpose is to buy cosmetics. If you don't give a shit how you look, or are satisfied already, there's no purpose. I'm not sure how people can care about their ship sinking when that's all there is to it, especially when there's a cash shop (Pirate Emporium) to buy stuff from. The game purports that it's free to explore, but it's mostly empty without engaging in a bunch of quests to slap skeletons that are also subject to hit reg. My brain stem is unfortunately competently saddled with some additional matter; I stopped playing [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] after realizing that the only thing that made it enjoyable at that point was thinking about other things while playing. \n\nCan be fun with friends, but what isn't, honestly? The main takeaway is that there's things that are [b]*more*[/b] fun to play, especially if you have friends. The large boss fights are cool, but after the first one you realize there's mostly just PvP left, and if you're looking for that there's more engaging full-loot PvP choices where the loot is more interesting than just refilling your cannons/health. PvP typically boils down to the horrendous on-foot combat. \n\nIt definitely is one of those \"could be\" games, if progression wasn't just quests/pillaging to buy... cosmetics, the end-game of which is just opening your wallet a second time.", "timestamp_created": 1672289615, "timestamp_updated": 1672303588, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522953152656555176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137857025": {"recommendationid": "137857025", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013769690", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1612326415}, "language": "english", "review": "bad", "timestamp_created": 1683336761, "timestamp_updated": 1683336761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522877633571624756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141398594": {"recommendationid": "141398594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108394214", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2542, "last_played": 1690377473}, "language": "english", "review": "Great with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1688589600, "timestamp_updated": 1688589600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522569477558135986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141397233": {"recommendationid": "141397233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111914482", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6702, "last_played": 1691087790}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing battles and atmosphere, it's all about sandbox fun!", "timestamp_created": 1688588325, "timestamp_updated": 1688588325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522569477558135986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137128016": {"recommendationid": "137128016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073943915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1682184547}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is online only with absolutely no option for single player, if it had this option it would be the perfect game but it is  ruined by a toxic player base.", "timestamp_created": 1682189117, "timestamp_updated": 1682189117, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522556900978088379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132693023": {"recommendationid": "132693023", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260949773", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1688286468}, "language": "english", "review": "Sucks .", "timestamp_created": 1676195208, "timestamp_updated": 1676195208, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522519290447235107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143453549": {"recommendationid": "143453549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141297412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1095, "last_played": 1674471383}, "language": "english", "review": "Rating: 1/10\n\nthis is an absolute disaster of a game that manages to be not just bad, but a complete waste of time and money. From the very first moment, it becomes painfully evident that the developers either ran out of ideas or simply didn't care about creating an engaging experience for players.\n\nThe most glaring flaw in Repetitive Wasteland is its unimaginable repetitiveness. The game's mechanics are so shallow and one-dimensional that it feels like you're stuck in an endless loop of mind-numbing tasks. Whether you're fighting generic enemies, solving predictable puzzles, or completing monotonous fetch quests, it all boils down to mindless button-mashing without any sense of progression or challenge.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of variety in the game's environments is truly disappointing. You'll be endlessly subjected to the same bland and uninspired landscapes, making you wonder if the developers even bothered to put any effort into level design. Exploring the world feels like a chore, and the desire to uncover hidden secrets quickly fades away when it becomes apparent that there's nothing worth discovering.\n\nThe story, if one can even call it that, is a disjointed mess. There's no compelling narrative to drive the gameplay forward, and the characters are as shallow as a puddle after a drizzle. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and adds nothing to the overall experience. It's almost as if the developers attempted to mimic a captivating plot but only managed to produce a laughable imitation.\n\nGraphically, the game is a mixed bag. While some character models and environments might look decent at first glance, the overall presentation lacks polish and feels dated. Poor optimization leads to frame rate drops and bugs that further detract from any enjoyment that could potentially be salvaged.\n\nThe audio design is equally subpar, with repetitive sound effects and a forgettable soundtrack that only add to the tedium. It's clear that little effort went into creating an immersive audio experience, leaving players feeling disconnected from the game's world.\n\nIn conclusion, Repetitive Wasteland is an absolute disaster that fails on almost every level. Its relentless monotony, lack of originality, and absence of any meaningful storytelling or engaging gameplay make it a complete waste of time and money. There are countless other games out there that deserve your attention, and this one should be avoided at all costs.

However, the PK or player killers make the game tedious and and unfulfilling. I have spent hours exploring, finding clues, and solving puzzles to have my ships sunk, killed, and respawn to distant isles. As this is a pirate game it would be unfair of me to expect otherwise.

Often times you don't realize a person's intent until they have shot you in the face. This game makes it easy to kill other players because much of this game relies on trust and cooperfation.

Playing sea shanties with your mates while you keep an eye on the horizon. Even the bugs were typically more funny than annoying because at the end of the day we were having a good time.\n\nSea of Thieves is at its best an immersive open world for you and your friends to enjoy and create memories together. That was until we got fed up with being constantly killed and spawn camped by other players. Over and over. The fun was lost in the frustration and we all quit playing. I kept the game in the back of my mind, though. I was hopeful that at some point the devs would listen to the large part of the community who were asking for some sort of PVE mode. One day we would be able to return.\n\nYears later I come back to check on the situation only to find that threads on their official forums which try to discuss the possibility of PVE/Private servers are immediately locked by the moderators. Ask for a higher FOV setting? The thread is locked and you are threatened with a ban if you modify your fov manually. You can't even comment on their official patch notes and update posts on steam. They are all automatically locked.\n\nThe devs do not want to hear your experiences or requests. They want to keep to their vision of a 'PVEVP' world. Everyone can choose to follow along or leave. So we left.\n\nI had some great times with my friends on this game, and I'm thankful for that. But, given that the developers refuse to even allow discussion for an option to play the game without the constant fear of being ganked by some twitch streamer on a sloop or a hacker flying through the air...

Prepare to set sail on a pirate adventure that's as vast as the open seas and as unpredictable as a drunken sailor. Welcome to Sea of Thieves, the multiplayer pirate paradise that will have you plundering, pillaging, and occasionally questioning your life choices.\n\nIn Sea of Thieves, you'll step into the worn boots of a pirate, ready to chart your own course through a beautiful world that feels like it was ripped straight from the pages of a child's storybook. From sandy beaches to sunken shipwrecks, this game is a visual treat that will make you say, \"Arr, that be pretty!\"\n\nBut be warned, mateys, Sea of Thieves is as treacherous as the Kraken's tentacles. The game throws you into a vast open world with little direction, leaving you to figure out the pirate life for yourself. You'll embark on quests, hunt for buried treasure, and engage in fierce ship-to-ship battles. And trust me, it's all fun and games until someone forgets to patch up their ship and finds themselves sinking to the depths of ol' Davy Jones' locker.\n\nOne of the joys of Sea of Thieves is the camaraderie that comes with sailing the high seas with your trusty crew. Whether you're sailing on a majestic galleon or manoeuvring a nimble sloop, working together is essential for success. But beware, for treachery and betrayal are as common as a peg-legged pirate.\n\nWhile the game excels in creating memorable moments with your crew, it can sometimes leave you searching for buried content. Sea of Thieves has been criticised for its lack of variety in quests and activities, which easily becomes a never-ending loop of fetch quests and chest digging.\n\nBut fear not, ye scurvy dogs, for Sea of Thieves is constantly expanding with regular updates and new adventures on the horizon. The developers continue to listen to the community and add exciting content, like ghost ships, cursed skeletons, and even fire-breathing sharks. So, keep an eye on the horizon for new plunder to claim.\n\nSo, if you're looking for a pirate experience that's more \"Yo Ho Ho\" than \"Walk the Plank,\" Sea of Thieves might just be the treasure you seek. But remember, the real treasure is the memories you make with your crew, the friendships forged through chaotic cannon fire, and the hilarious mishaps that will have you laughing like a jolly old pirate. Set sail, ye dog, and may the winds guide you to a pirate's life worth living.

"review": "Rare's [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is, if nothing else, a game that is fully committed to being itself.  From the expressive, cartoonish character models to the goofy cannon physics, it's a game that is determined to sell you the pirate fantasy in a child-friendly, [i]Muppets Treasure Island[/i] or [i]Pirates of Dark Water[/i] package.  You go on procedurally-generated piratey adventures, featuring standard piratey setpieces like sunken ships, sea monsters, trade shipping, and going ashore to dig for treasure.  These procedural adventures give you goods that can be sold for gold at port, which can in turn be used to purchase cosmetics (there are no mechanical upgrades).  Rinse and repeat for a piratey good time, yo ho!...\n\n...oh, and lest we forget, this childish pirate game has some of the most ruthless, obligatory, high-skill-ceiling, running PvP battles in video game history, in a decision that is certainly [i]compelling[/i] but is nevertheless kind of [i]mystifying[/i] as to the target audience of [i]Sea of Thieves[/i].\n\n[h1]Who Is This Game For?[/h1]\nBeneath the surface of the shallow initial game (\"do these six varieties of automatically-repopulating [i]Skyrim[/i] quests, forever\"), [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] has a frankly fascinating risk-versus-reward metagame.  This is because all of those salable goods that you generate from questing - which does get boring and samey after a while - can be stolen by other players, leaving you with nothing to show for your time.  This is mandatory and cannot be disabled; you are [b]always[/b] vulnerable to other players' will to violence, and hunting other players is very frequently a more expedient method to riches than grinding PvE content.  If you're playing [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] solo, as you probably will be when you're first getting into this game, you need to be very prepared for every few treasure-hunting outings to end in a crew of several veteran players making you bite the nautical curb.\n\nThis incentivizes new players to either burn out or make friends [i]very[/i] quickly, because the best defense against marauding players is a crew of your own players and good core gameplay skills.  Sailing with a crew will allow you to blast through the grindy content faster, and sail your ship better, thus allowing you to make it back to port faster and sell the gold, and so forth, in addition to defending yourself against other, hostile players.  Just as you start to come to grips with not constantly getting drubbed every time you just try to get a little questing in, [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] introduces the Emissary system, which gives you large gold multipliers if you stay out at sea longer without returning and cashing in your winnings, which gives you more opportunities to get killed by other players, die, and lose everything, starting from scratch.  And all the while, the gold prices of the cosmetics get more and [b]more[/b] and [b]MORE[/b] expensive, pushing you towards those riskier plays, pushing you towards flagging as an Emissary when you quest...\n\n...pushing you towards just saying \"screw it, enough is enough\" and spending your play sessions hunting other players who are doing all the grind for you.\n\n[h1]Sea of Thieves, Beneath the Eyepatch[/h1]\n\nIn other words, the core draw of [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] initially [b]appears[/b] to be fun piratey adventure, but once you've spent enough time in its very samey cartoon isles, all of the game systems point you towards one-or-both of two options: an incredibly brutal grind to earn lategame cosmetics, or becoming the genocidal PvP sweatlords that mad-dogged you to death in the early game.  And, despite the silly cartoon exterior, as a vicious naval warfare sim it [b]works[/b], in large part [b]because[/b] of the push-and-pull of the game's lackluster questing and its perverse currency incentives.  Since the game was first released, players have begged Rare for a PvE-only mode where you can just do nautical-themed radial quests forever, but near the end of my time with [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] I came to the realization that to do so would be to ruin what makes [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] special.  What animates the PvE adventures is the [i]knowledge[/i] that at any time a gang of players could come in and ruin your day, and even when other players [i]aren't[/i] around, the risk of their presence creates a kind of soft timer.  The shifting nature of its sea combat, where you might be in the middle of fighting a PvE kraken and suddenly get nailed by a player's cannonball, or even be on the other side of that lopsided ambush, adds the endless replayability that comes with a \"human element\" to a samey, grindy experience.\n\nThis may sound like i'm damning it with faint praise, but [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is a PvP game with just enough variety of peaceful options to keep it evergreen, and although that means it's certainly not a game for everyone, or even most people, it sticks the landing in a way that few other PvE/PvP hybrid titles do with such style and aplomb.\n\nJust don't come to it expecting a stress-free experience, because [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is white-knuckle the whole way, land lubber.", "timestamp_created": 1679099239, "timestamp_updated": 1679099239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134791596": {"recommendationid": "134791596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041586813", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3638, "last_played": 1680381218}, "language": "english", "review": "Si, Pescar.", "timestamp_created": 1679026182, "timestamp_updated": 1679026182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134606305": {"recommendationid": "134606305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294132025", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4511, "last_played": 1668694747}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not a 45 yo father, probably not one of the oldest people playing this game. I am not a single father to my yet non existant Son, who is not 14 now. My maybe soon to be son got this game for Christmas from his yet non existant uncle, so we didn't install it on his computer and he didn't start playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game, sikes. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he doesn't exist yet. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do.

Rare's golden goose of new players has led to a stigma and prioritization of PVE and its content. Not a bad thing, but when PVE is clearly prioritized on one side for monetization, rather than split 50/50 with PVP, issues arise on the other side. Hourglass is perfect content for the PVP niche, but, following 5 years, no real anti-cheat, or anything has been developed to combat cheaters. Cheater's have been on the rise, and Rare has done nothing. They went as far as to release a reporting system to where you can report offensive names, but not the main problem of cheating. Serving a big F-U to players.\n\nEither way, stigma's within the community following Rare's lack of initiative arose, and PVE players simply, to this day, ignore the problem as why would they? Cheater's aren't a problem in PVE SOT, but PVP, Cheater's are abundant and with PVP being such a low niche in the game, there's no real way to fairly represent a quater of the player base, not when most of well known, respected, and knowledgeable people have been banned either unfairly, or for the use of 120 FOV, which is considered cheating because of its third party application to the game's set FOV of 90.\n\nEven past the glaring issues of Rare's golden goose's, and Rare's lack of updates on cheater's, Sea of Thieves is built on an old, outdated engine, which refuses to be upgraded because of SOT's partnership with X-Box. This of course causes problems such as D-sync, poor performance in some areas, laggy terrain and sea's, and the most apparent, Hit-Reg, which has plagued the game for years, and still remains a constant issue. Hit-Reg essentially boils down to your Bullets, cannonballs, and or any type of projectile not registering with the server, meaning you did no damage towards your target. A controversial topic that has been addressed and somewhat fixed, but still remains constant due to the poor foundation which this game is run on.\n\nHere's to the closure of Rare's partnership with X-Box, and the betterment of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1675227587, "timestamp_updated": 1686035439, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131947957": {"recommendationid": "131947957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338284770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 2414, "last_played": 1696289708}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always wanted to play this game.

This game could be so much more. They got a lot of things right, but messed up on the most important thing, Gameplay. In a PvPvE game, the PvE has to be challenging to increase the intensity of PvP. The PvE in this game is not challenging at all. Even the \"hardest\" PvE events are not challenging they are just time consuming. Which is a double offense. The game lacks engaging content, so they make the content they have take way too long to accomplish. I find myself bored halfway through the Fort of the Damned, because it is the same thing over and over again. It is fun at first and the PvP can be a lot of fun! Unfortunately, the PvP is rare, and after learning the game you find out there is nothing to actually do. You can only unlock so many cosmetics before you realize you are actually just wasting your time. If you are wondering if you should play this game, my advice is go find another game that the developers actually care about the content of their games. Not a game like this, that spends more effort on making skins.\nTLDR: Fun at first, if you are playing with friends. Quickly will realize this game has no fun content outside of PvP. With the game in the state it is, PvP is rare, because no one has fun with the PvE.

I have played more than 500 hours of this game as I write this review, and I can positively say that I enjoy almost every aspect of this game as it evolves throughout the years. But why? Why would you play this game?\n\nBefore I continue, it should be known that this game is best played with friends or at least other people, as the game is more challenging solo. While it takes some getting used to, flying solo is not an impossible task if you are buying the game for yourself and can provide some pretty valuable experience for survival on the seas. I have probably played 150 if not more hours solo in this game and I can say that it is possible to manage your own ship solo, it just takes a hefty amount of multi-tasking. If you still need a crew to play with, the game will provide an open queue to allow players to play with random pirates across the seas if needed.\n\nThe first thing to note about this game is the title: \"Sea of Thieves.\" This game is a high-risk, high-reward game which allows for constant thievery and betrayal across the ocean. It is especially important to remember that that all loot found on the seas is not rightfully yours until you cash it in, which you'll find is a common misconception in this game. Just because you have loot on your ship doesn't mean it's yours, as you'll quickly learn that everybody wants a piece of that glittering bounty stashed on your ship. This will be important as you start out in this game, as it is a few years old and there will be players better than you whom you will come into contact with eventually. This means: you will sink. Sinking or losing a battle is natural in this game, and it comes with the experience. I've lost countless battles on my adventures and lost countless amounts of gold to other players, but it builds experience and in turn helps you become a more feared ship on the seas.\n\nWithout spoiling too many of the things you should discover on your own, here are some things to know about the game as you take your first steps:\n1. The developers themselves have stated that this game is a shared pvp/pve world, meaning contact with other players is mostly inevitable. Almost everything you do takes place in this sandbox so you will most likely need to defend yourself and your ship.\n2. This game revolves around cosmetics. This game is not a pay to win game, as almost everything can be earned in-game via in-game currency (gold) and through unlocking achievements and commendations (in-game achievements). Meaning most clothing and ship cosmetics come from your in-game earnings rather than your real wallet.\n3. There are numerous story missions (tall tales) for those who want to play a more guided experience and have fun uncovering the mysteries and lore of the world of the sea of thieves. \n4. Want to get straight into pvp battle? There is a queue for that too! Just check the hourglass on your ship's captain table.\n5. The developers constantly update this game as to provide players with a fresh experience. There are frequent seasons that each bring new mechanics and aspects to the game, each bringing a free 100 level pass as well. This game evolves on a regular basis, and the devs love this game to death.\n\nIn the end, every session in this game is an adventure. With the numerous amounts of things to do on the open seas, every session will be different and will be a new story to tell. Who knows? One day you could be digging up treasure on the smallest of islands, another day you could be defending your ship from the almighty kraken, or maybe you spend some time solving puzzles in the ancient ruins from a long-lost past (They could all happen in one session too!). The choice is yours. It all comes down to experience, so the more you play and discover, the more fun you'll have making a name for yourself on the seas. You will meet lots of people, fights lots of enemies, and sink many times, but that my friend, is all part of the adventure. \n\nThanks for reading.\n", "timestamp_created": 1672872220, "timestamp_updated": 1672872220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130134366": {"recommendationid": "130134366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024557594", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1607749614}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of Steves.", "timestamp_created": 1672863037, "timestamp_updated": 1672863037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129996586": {"recommendationid": "129996586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999226054", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 5215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5065, "last_played": 1690461272}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanna be a pirate and rule the seven seas?

unique gaming experiences in recent years.\" to my friends, but it does not mean I would recommend them this game either. Despite the amount of hours I have invested into SoT already- I feel like my opinion as a gamer matters just as much as anyone else's when I speak about what I do NOT like about Sea of Thieves.\n\nThe concept, mechanics, graphics, and overall functionality of the game are -fantastic-, there is little other titles out today that are going to provide a consistent sensation of exploration and creative enjoyment entirely based on the actions you decide as a player like SoT does. \n\nHowever, before I continue, I shall politely warn this is where all of the more \"Hardcore players\" can stop reading as this next bit reflects some of my own personal experiences within Sea of Thieves.\n\nI completely dislike the aspect of PvP in Sea of Thieves, as it leaves a foul taste in my mouth that prevents me from playing more consistently and daily for that matter. It simply doesn't feel rewarding to me, even if I end up being victorious. I totally understand -why- it is in the game, but by allowing any player to make any choice they wish, you can imagine how a complete stranger on the internet is going to treat another stranger with some confidence. I have over 250 hours in sailing the seas, fishing for Battlegills and Stormtails, riding the waves to chase the sun, even repelling giant Sea-Monster attacks to protect my loot, yet, regrettably I have only been in a single instance of jolly cooperation with a total stranger within my entire playtime. That one instance was only caused by me calling out a TTVer while he was streaming my ship being destroyed, and I pretended to recognize him just to get a ceasefire.\n\nWould I recommend SoT to a casual player or my other friends? No, especially with Season 8 being my final nail. This game fits a certain niche for those who don't mind playing with such a punishing risk vs reward system that also has one of the biggest in-game grindfests I've witnessed. On top of all this it hurts me to see all the people, like myself, who desire for PvE-only servers so that we can enjoy the game we paid for.

Merchant life is a laid back one for sure.  Most days are spent cleaning up wrecks of previous failed merchants, or running errands for those too lazy to do it themselves.   This particular day I was catching snakes in the wild to sell for a small profit. Looking for the last Black Scaled Snake needed, I hear an explosion - a keg.  Certain my snakes had all been reduced to ashes, I ran to my ship and see the culprit himself. He too was dressed as the very weapon he used to try and ruin my day. As the only one to not to make it out alive, the man quickly returned to the ferry.  Luckily, snakes are immortal and they made it out alive, allowing me to finish my commendation.  I then made it my SOLE.LIFE.MISSION. to bring an end and ruin the entire career of the crew who tried to take the lives of my snakes and my boat.  I knew exactly who they were, too. A crew running FOTD but a few squares away. I detach the rowboat and immediately start sailing in their direction. The plan was simple. Sink them. Steal the life-changing chest of legends! Certain they had me sunk from a single keg, they recklessly began to loot, without even watching the horizon. Foolish mistake. Perhaps the last mistake they'll live to make----   And it was. One-blunder to the back of the head, the harpoonist was the first to fall. One Blunder to the next, trying to climb the ladder and aid his fallen crewmate. respawn time was more than long enough to secure a nearby keg, and bring it aboard. lighting the keg I could hear a third top deck. He immediately runs below to extinguish the fuse and prevent catastrophe, but it was far too late, Karma had already struck. Mere moments later the ship was no more. and neither was the crew. No amount of gold was more valuable than the lives I stole from them, but I still helped myself to a few trophies.     The Merchant life is laid back for sure, but we'll fight anyone who intends to disrupt our course in anyway. So I encourage you, sailor, keep it that way.

It's not the worst. But Sea of Thieves suffers from a crisis of direction.\n\nThis is a game with a fanbase that overwhelmingly loves PvE and grinding. You can't swing a stick in any community for this game without hitting someone complaining about getting sunk by another player. There was once a matchmade PVP skirmish mode that was deactivated for lack of traffic -- and the traffic that was there would, every match (I kid you not), park their boats and go fight each other with the profoundly monotonous melee/gun combat.\n\nI'm one of the people that a lot of reviewers here are gonna call \"griefers.\" I once loved a little airship-to-airship combat game you might have heard of called Guns of Icarus Online, and at first my enjoyment of SoT was carried by its parallels to that once-awesome game with SoT's open-world twist. I loved player combat, I loved sinking ships, I loved stealing and fencing other player's loot, just as I'm sure others loved doing it to me and my friends whenever we were feeling less pvp-inclined. Pitched battles between two competent crews were incredible affairs that sprung up organically and felt like a truly epic high-stakes experience.\n\nBut as time went on, and Rare kept shrugging at the part of the fanbase who loved PVP, pumping out more and more and more pve content to keep the most possible fans happy and retained, all the best PVPers left and all the best SOT players kept playing PVE content that gets progressively more isolated and instanced. All this leads to an environment where the most piracy you do will either be against people too new or scared to fight back. The capable players are all doing the 4th part of some scripted quest chain off in their own special segment of the game where nobody can see or hurt them. Landlubbers.\n\nI stopped playing SoT a long time ago and am really just leaving this here because I'm so disappointed every time I see new news about it in my feed. Always new PVE events. If you want to sail and do treasure hunts and fetch quests and lengthy multi-quest chains, and occasionally get sunk by people wishing they were playing a different game, then I guess you might have fun on the sea of thieves. The only thing that could entice me and my friends back is the reintroduction of accessible pvp and players that actually want to play it, and I have a feeling we'll all be long condemned to Davy Jones' Locker before Rare/Microsoft ever consider it.", "timestamp_created": 1689695402, "timestamp_updated": 1689695529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52058112621307373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147462563": {"recommendationid": "147462563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052112938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 770, "last_played": 1679262084}, "language": "english", "review": "Its honestly fun but as a new player I felt like I got burnt out SUPER fast.

Instead, there's layer after layer of achievements, gold, the secondary \"gold\", actual cash, faction influence, unlockables, titles, faction ranks, and whatever else keeps flashing on my screen. From the perspective of a new player who isn't looking to make a full time job out of a game, this was not for me.\n\nAs you're playing the game, you're bombarded relentlessly with so many achievements that you're not even sure what's worth keeping track of or where to find the results. There's categories upon categories of things to track, but I honestly have no idea how to navigate them because most of them are purely decorative. I'll go into the menu trying to find more information about my mission only to end up scrolling past pets and seasonal events. You'll be trying to read a comment in one corner while notifications blip away in the top left, bottom center, and top right simultaneously. Displacing each other in their fight to win your attention. It feels like I've got a slot machine running on my screen.\n\nI'm personally not very keen on the idea of the modern multiplayer mechanic tropes that invade every MMO. I don't want to study a wiki or be present when the game releases in order to experience a fresh new world. You won't ever feel like you're just starting out, because you'll see a thousand locked items and quest buttons and maxed players everywhere you go. There's no humble store selling a stack of wood and a few apples. The whole game from beginning to end is presented to you as soon as you land. As a new player it's overwhelming and comes across as flat.\n\nEven the basic tools you're given are ridiculously presented. Here's a sword and here's a banana, great! Oh, and here's thirteen different instruments you'll never need and half a dozen minor tools without explanation, all of which receive equal priority in your baffling control scheme. Controls are poorly layered on keyboard, feeling almost arbitrary. Scrolling works for your weapons, which strangely don't appear in the quick menu, and the dedicated inventory has almost no use. The quest menu appears more keen on telling you about seasonal unlocks and generic faction relations than your actual mission. Worst of all, there are at least three different buttons used as a back button: E, Escape, or X. Controls are clunky and tedious to memorize, making them frustrating to deploy in a hurry.\n\nMeanwhile the actual game is buried behind those relentless notifications and customization features. Searching out, digging up, hauling and defending treasure is fun, though unloading is pretty boring. Managing the anchor, sails, wheel, and repairs of the ship is extremely satisfying. Ship on ship battles is likewise pretty great if everyone's into it. The world looks great and has all the right elements.\n\nBut, again, there's a thick layer of not-so-great on top of that. You're introduced to characters at the start of the game who very quickly lose all personality, becoming cash registers with the same cheap jokes on repeat, leaving you, the player, as the only living thing in the entire town. You're introduced to resources, yet will be disappointed to find that nothing is saved between sessions--not your ship's goods or your inventory--and all those things you stockpiled were meaningless. You can carry so few things that even the stockpiling itself is annoying. Everywhere you go you find barrels full of seemingly useful resources, the same ones that appear in the hold of your ship. Surely some extra fruit and boards will improve your stores, right? Wrong. There's no admission of this either, you'll just realize they're worthless after a few hours and never bother after that. They're resources you can't sell, can't carry in bulk, can't use more than one at a time, can find literally anywhere, disappear at the end of the day anyway, and have minimal impact on your experience. Why even have resources that have no rarity, persistence, or significance? Once you realize those things are worthless you stop exploring islands with the same excitement or interest. It's just more junk you can't keep or use. Get the treasure and move on. Grind.\n\nArmor and weapons don't have any upgrades at all that I can see, just expensive customization. So much customization.

There have been times where we get there and the loot is just not there because there are hacks that can steal loot from uncompleted world events that nearly take 30 minutes, Imagine playing 30 minutes, just to find an empty room.Another problem we have is we also like P.v.P but the hourglass P.v.P is riddled with cheaters and there is nothing you can do unless you are very skilled to go against them, This is very annoying because the skeleton and ghost curse (That turns your character into the respective skeleton or ghost) are locked behind a game mode that is riddled with cheaters.\n\n\nOne of the other big problems with  the game is constant game breaking bugs, that are confusing and detrimental, Lets take an example, Just tonight me and my Friend were in a hourglass P.V.P fight and we had a good spot, We  were circling around the enemy loading cannons into them and my game decided the grab the sail angle changer while i was all the way at the front of the ladder looking at the steering wheel of our sloop. Another example from yesterday, I was on a galleon with four friends and we ran into a very talented brigantine, that kept knocking our masts over, and a multitude of times i was repairing the mast and it started to auto fall over again, (I don't think this is intended) we made sure not to have anyone on it holding the up or down key we had the mast partially fixed and it re-fell every time before it got fixed. \n\nAnother problem we have run into in this game is that there is not enough content, the only very rewarding content is the fort events, and the hourglass pvp (If you can win) We either need multiple world events at a time or other \"Rewarding\" things to do or else it is very easy to lose interest\n\n\n\n\n\nGood thing about this game though is it hold to the pirate way your loot can be stolen while you are grinding it, or the opposite, you can sale the seven seas, do cool story quests with captain jack sparrow, unlock pirate legend and have new things to grind for, and you can really have fun with friends as long as you avoid all the negative things I commented.\n\nSo for these reasons I can not recommend the game. but If you do not mind playing around the bugs and cheater this game is a spot on pirate game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1684048572, "timestamp_updated": 1684048572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51913982629776001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135114039": {"recommendationid": "135114039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164404230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14572, "last_played": 1691976232}, "language": "english", "review": "Solo sloopers in co-operation with the Reaper's Bones present: Total PvE player death.\n\nKill PvE players.

I would suggest streamlining the menus and removing some of the different keys that do essentially the same thing. there's about 5 keys bound to different interactions and its too much to remember this merchant needs me to press F and that one needs me to press R. seems like the devs have never used a keyboard in their lives.\n\nRare used to make such good games too, this game is visually stunning and i think the quests and puzzles are really well done, but they're all caught up in their psychotic fantasy of pvp all the time everywhere, this game has so much potential and could be so much more its really sad and truly unfortunate that rare chose this direction.\n\nI really can't see myself or any other die hard fans of pve spending more than 100 hours on the game before leaving for good, then what pvp will you have? very unsustainable. honestly hope the game dies so maybe i can come back and sail in peace.", "timestamp_created": 1689119084, "timestamp_updated": 1689128713, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51852339506149292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147682993": {"recommendationid": "147682993", "author": {"steamid": "76561199487128254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 861, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1696047353}, "language": "english", "review": "worst game. combat is so bad. the gameplay is also bad.", "timestamp_created": 1696514309, "timestamp_updated": 1696514309, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147682721": {"recommendationid": "147682721", "author": {"steamid": "76561199441695662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 660, "playtime_at_review": 660, "last_played": 1696248391}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game fun for about 5 hours.

Forced PvP stunts progress, and makes it a frustrating play for those who do not want their progress stolen by otherwise is a toxic group of players. By defending this failed \"feature\", you are the problem and the reason why no one plays this game.\n\nMonetization and Very Little Rewards\nOne may say that a cosmetic-only monetization system is fine. By why are the in-game shop items so expensive? 120,000 gold for one ship skin? Are you nuts? When it takes 80 hours just to pimp out your ship with one set, you know the grind is too hard or the shops are too expensive. Seriously, the forts are easily 8-12,000 gold, and it costs well over 2 million for one set?

also found folks especially younger generation in the game extremely toxic calling out racial slurs and playing the game like its TF2 or Fortnight as there only there to gloat and troll folks for hours on end, as well Aimbots use and other mods running in background to cheat the game, the game desperately needs anti cheat especially for how this game is. \n\ni understand is a pirate game and Pve and PvP are there, but is sad folks takes in the nasty troll mentality in a game and not play it how is done, i love the game but wish there was a way to teach me how to fight and naval combat as i have yet to do anything other then sail.\n\nThe game needs to have a tier system for new players to alow to them to ease into the game, the intro to this game is not very good, as its a fetch quest and teach you to slap a board on the mast to fix it. it literally tosses you in the frey. i wish this game has a way to opt out PvP or at the very least match up with folks at proper experience and levels, as majority of folks now are hunting down new players and doing there usual trolling stuff, i find it boring and tiresome to leave to lobby and restart the game to jump into a new instance. sadly cause there is an event most elite players are back hunting folks down to troll, until the even is over and nothing new till the next update, that be a good time to try the game out as folks be bored from trolling till the next big update.\n\ni want to love this game, just a wish there was a tweek for new folks to play, i can't even leave port without a 9 year old and there friends tea

You can go and dig up treasure from a x-marks the spot map, you can uncover ancient vaults and get as much loot as possible for the gold hoarders, you can go around and take out skeletons and bring their skulls back to the order of souls for secrects to be learned, or run cargo from island to island, or you could find lost shipments for merchant alliance. You could also fish and slay the kraken and one of several megalodon species and turn the meat in. Or, if you think all that grinding is too time consuming, run with the reapers bones, and turn in others stolen loot and emissary flag for coin instead. \n\nThere are several story missons as well, called tall tales for you to play to uncover the lore the game has. From the shores of gold, which tells a massive story, to the pirates life tall tale story about Jack Sparrow. This game has anything that a pirate could wish for. And I didn't even cover cosmetics that you can unlock for your pirate, pet (if you buy one), and your vessel. Save up enough gold and buy your own ship and give it a name of your own to add even more personal touches onto your boat. \n\nYou can play solo, or up to four friends. And the last thing to remember, this is a pirate game after all.

The story missions (Mainly Tall Tales) get tedious at times, & multiple require replaying the mission multiple times for completion. Not in a \"There are multiple choices/paths\" sort of way, but in a \"Only a fraction of the needed items for completion spawn per run\" or \"You must complete this mission X times\" sorts of ways. Although there are PvE and PvP encounters, the lack of separation means that at any point whatever you're doing, someone can mess it up for you. Though the number of hackers/exploiters may not be colossal, the lack of decent anti-cheat is disturbing.\n\nLike with any other game, truly the worst part is other players/the community. Yes there are great people; but there are also the kind of people who would burn a barn for \"fun\".\n\nDo I recommend this game, as it is currently, to people; no. At least, that is, until proper separation for those of us who mind our own business and prefer PvE, for those who lack the basic human decency to realize not everyone wants to PvP.

The end game isn't high class either, but this is essentially a World of Warcraft situation where the game doesn't actually start until you reach max level. Hell, just getting someone who already has a captained ship to play with you is *miles* better than trying to do the early game by yourself. Once you get your own captained sloop, guess what?

You get an unbelievable amount of stuff for the season for free! And even if you pay to pay for the pass you'll get your moneys back by the end of completing it. \n\nYes it's Sea of Thieves and PVP is a big part of the game but i have also found many a night where i have played a shanty or two on another ship drinking to the sunset. \n\nThere are times where i take a break from this game because i have done everything in the current season and is eagerly awaiting the next which leads me to one of the very few downsides of the game.\n\nAnd that is I do wish they would add something extra after rank 100 in the season pass, it would encourage me to remain on after but i will always return and look forward to taking part in world changing events and new horizons..\n\nDefinitely a game you can play solo. But always better with a crew at your side.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1669147653, "timestamp_updated": 1669147653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516574561595916748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139709694": {"recommendationid": "139709694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167325342", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 5416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 157, "playtime_at_review": 2100, "last_played": 1695584954}, "language": "english", "review": "sank my man's ship with bananas 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1686177641, "timestamp_updated": 1686177641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516556262969970703", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144110921": {"recommendationid": "144110921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109234689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 65640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2019, "playtime_at_review": 62496, "last_played": 1696544443}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Sea of Thieves will all my heart, but it's in such a terrible state that I can't even recommend it to anyone.

Here's Why:\n\nSTORY: They exist, but they're not good. The \"Tall Tales\" are just doing the same things you've been doing, but with long sailing in between. The speaking is very well done, but there was no effort to make it new or engaging, just repeating solo mode with NPCs telling you why you're doing it.\n\nTECHNICAL WORK: I move this up because it's become increasingly problematic. The game seems to run well, considering how demanding it is on your computer, but they've been sacrificing gameplay for new content. Much like Destiny, they're so focused on putting out mini-adventures that no one plays, and microtransactions that only tryhards pay for, that they've slipped on maintaining the actual game you bought. As more Adventures are released, i've faced more and more bugs in normal adventure mode:\nOLD BUGS: Slingshotting, projectiles disappearing, enemies teleporting, barrel contents being invisible.\nNEW BUGS: can't turn left or right after jumping into water, can't fire myself from cannons, can't load cannons, can't use emotes, can't pick up crates.\nEvery time a new adventure is released these bugs get worse, and more frequent, which deeply concerns me about the long-term care that will be shown to the playerbase.\n\nREGULATION: In the true spirit of a free pirate game, there is no regulation whatsoever on PVP. In fact they further encouraged it with the Reaper's Bones alliance. Oddly enough, the reapers I meet tend to be silent, or at least polite. How nice :) the unfortunate aspect is the players flying alliance flags who fire without warning (as a pirate might do) while screaming slurs, profanity and insults (typical shut-ins) I'm sure the devs are trying to do what they can, but this is more of a warning that the player base seems to be becoming increasingly toxic and abusive as the game slowly dies, due to the lackluster content.\n\nOn a positive note, the game itself is still quite a work of art in terms of realistic sailing mechanics and ship combat. I would only recommend it if you are willing to quit and restart until you find a server that's pretty quiet, or you're a salty bleached ***hole who wants to assert your virtual dominance rather than getting a job.", "timestamp_created": 1668834075, "timestamp_updated": 1668834075, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515182673931121826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146660625": {"recommendationid": "146660625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033481946", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1677267929}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with awesome art style and sea physics..

Boarding from the ladders ends up making the ship combat itself superfluous, since any time spent loading a cannon ball is better spent getting in your enemy's ship, because even with the cursed cannonballs you can do infinitely more damage to an opponent on foot than with heavy artillery. \n\nThe game play incentives mean that there is no benefit beyond risk aversion to choosing not to fight other players. On paper this should make seeing another ship on the horizon a tense encounter, as you both silently weigh your odds of besting your opponent against the treasure you stand to lose should you sink. In practice, however, spotting another ship on the horizon is often an exercise in frustration. Players who want to engage in combat will be frustrated because the ships they see will either flee for fear of losing their loot or outgun them so heavily that its not worth the encounter. Meanwhile, players who just want to enjoy the game's many PvE loops will either become filled with panic upon seeing an enemy ship and immediately disrupt whatever task they actually wanted to do or will slowly die from the background radiation of stress that comes with doing any task that takes you from your ship because, even with a vigilant eye, another player could show up at seemingly any moment to sink your ship and, depending on how long you've been actively avoiding others, waste potentially hours of time and loot collection.\n\nExplicit incentives toward PvP combat beyond just stealing your opponent's loot also means that the game's community naturally biases toward aggressive, toxic players who are often, at best, unsympathetic to players who get sunk in combat they didn't consent to, and at worst actively hostile or dismissive to anyone to anyone unwilling to enthusiastically participate in it.\n\nOn the whole, Sea of Thieves is a game made of two disparate experiences awkwardly stapled together. On one hand there is the PvP ship combat that fails to reach its full potential because both the ships and the combat itself are designed around NPC encounters and thus are easily exploited by thematically dissonant tactics. On the other is a perfectly enjoyable pirate themed PvE adventure game with a good variety of tasks and just enough of a story element to not be completely vacuous, which itself is unable to reach its full potential due to the ever present specter of other players interrupting your relaxing sailing experience like a proverbial older brother coming to knock over your hard built sand castle. Neither element as they currently exist fully complement the other, and without a significant revamp to one or the other the game will continue to shamble like the forgotten, hate-riddled prototype of Frankenstein's monster until the servers shut down and the game is rendered unplayable to all but the most committed to video game piracy and preservation.\n\nAlso the sniper rifle is worthless in PvP which feels like a personal slight.", "timestamp_created": 1667990150, "timestamp_updated": 1667990150, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514545917510986328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146731137": {"recommendationid": "146731137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972377759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 53526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1944, "playtime_at_review": 51580, "last_played": 1696516190}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2665", "timestamp_created": 1695324192, "timestamp_updated": 1695324192, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514419317245483398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132407198": {"recommendationid": "132407198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835327640", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4289, "last_played": 1678852771}, "language": "english", "review": "ARRRGHe you ready for an adventure?", "timestamp_created": 1675835729, "timestamp_updated": 1675835729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514346480369567871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128655440": {"recommendationid": "128655440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372948258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 13112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7856, "last_played": 1675283181}, "language": "english", "review": "i really liked putting the black friend in a brig.", "timestamp_created": 1671187734, "timestamp_updated": 1671187734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514310002326965332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135918437": {"recommendationid": "135918437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252609702", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1680641691}, "language": "english", "review": "gg", "timestamp_created": 1680393873, "timestamp_updated": 1680393873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514285683631896973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131006764": {"recommendationid": "131006764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119487465", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 25057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1234, "playtime_at_review": 3898, "last_played": 1696439687}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic for playing with friends, alright enough for playing alone.

spikes because it's xbox servers )\n\ni know this is a salty review but it is IMPORTANT TO KNOW for people interested into getting the game for the first time\n\n70% of players who me and my gf met while playing over 10 hours where relentless harasser who pursue you for an hour ( literally ) until you eventually run out of provision and end up sinking with all your loot....this is insanely annoying...the only thing who will bring me back into playing is if they even care about players who are annoyed of the toxic community who just have to know if you even have any loot on board or if you have a ton of loot...or just want people to rage and feel better about their low self esteem\n\n\nwhat do they even gain aside of stealing from others?   oh yeah...full approval by the dev team for toxic behaviour\n\n\n\n\nthe only positivity i can say is how much money you can make now compared to when the game launched....much apreciated....but the toxic community kills the game in it's entirety none the less\n\ni disliked the community back in 2018...and now 5 years later...it's peak toxicity...i never hopped on a game with such a toxic community in 18 years of multiplayer gaming experience.....of the 9-10 player boats who got close to us, only 2 did nothing to us....and 3 of them literally pursued us for 30-60 minutes until they sank us....we literally just got back into the game to give an other shot after 5 years of updates....and that's how the community welcome us\n\n\nyes, haha cringe....salty review........but it's still the experience someone had on the game...would you like that to happend to you?      risking to have all your things stolen by a group of monkeys in heat looking for attention?", "timestamp_created": 1682441372, "timestamp_updated":

At first, it was fun. The PVP was a lot of fun and was completely under control. I miss arena mode. \nWith these most recent seasons, the gameplay has not only gotten worse (with the new pvp included), but the amount of hacking that's allowed on this platform is ridiculous. I'll get to that in a minute. \n\nYeah a bunch of new features have been added that could potentially make the game great, but along with that came devs who dont give a single shit when it comes to people ruining the game for others. \nThe new PVP that was introduced forces you into an ongoing circle with another player with a chance to lose everything you have including all of your materials. I've spend hours going in circles with a ship that didnt want to fight and it was the most boring interaction I've had in the game. I refused to touch PVP further and just continue doing world events, tall tales etc. \n\nThen come the hackers. \nToday, I witnessed a sloop take out a galleon, and then approach our ship. They parked a mile away, shot a member out of the canons and although it was nearly impossible for them to approach right away, they spawned on our ship with a keg and blew us up. \nWe managed to scramble together and fix our ship. In no less than ten seconds, and without any players near our ship, an athena keg already lit spawned in the center of our ship and nuked us. \nMy crew mates managed to get to their ship and were unable to kill them no matter how many hits it took. The members of the sloop also moved around unreasonably fast. \n\nThis isnt the first time this has happened. Players like this make the game incredibly unfun for everyone. I've spent hundreds of dollars on this game and I want my money back. I know I'll never get it, so in return I'll be telling everyone to avoid playing this game. \n\nI will be uninstalling it.

Invisible players. \n\nI have fallen through rocks and boulders on islands and other players not in my crew are invisible. Three times so far, I've had invisible players easily board my ship, wreck it through various ways, and kill me without me being able to see them. Typically, its just two shots with a blunderbuss coming out of nowhere.\n\nGrieving is REAL in this game. \nWe were fighting an Ashen Lord on an island, when 2 guys in a schooner decided to raid our ship, and blow it up. They could've just taken the treasure, who cares, but they decided to camp the island for 2 hours for treasure worth a mere 5000 gold at best. They didn't fight the boss at all, they just stayed on their ship and harassed us. \n\nIf you want PVP naval combat, you willnt find it on this game. All people do is canon over to your ship, invisibly board it, drop your anchor, set flame to your ship, or keg it. Larger crews will easily overpower you. For no reason, they attack smaller vessels that have very little reward. \n\nI'd like to see a feature that allows for PVP to be turned off.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665758386, "timestamp_updated":

The game features a wide range of activities for players to engage in, including battling rival pirate crews, solving puzzles, and completing quests for various in-game factions.\n\nOne of the standout features of Sea of Thieves is its emphasis on cooperative play, with players working together to operate their ship, defend against enemy attacks, and complete quests. The game also has a strong focus on player choice, allowing players to customize their pirate character and choose their own path through the game.\n\nThe visuals in Sea of Thieves are stunning, with a beautiful open-world environment and highly detailed character models. The game's soundtrack is also noteworthy, featuring a mix of original compositions and licensed tracks that fit the game's pirate theme perfectly.\n\nOverall, Sea of Thieves is a highly enjoyable and immersive multiplayer game that is well worth checking out for fans of action-adventure and cooperative play. Its stunning visuals and unique setting make it a standout title in the crowded multiplayer market.

time. The concept is solid and I want to have a fun coop/pvp pirate adventure game but it relies so much on health sponge enemies and after all these years I was hoping they would have filled out the game a bit more but most of it is just waste your time so you can be third partied by another crew. There is almost no progression, which is a dual edge sword. Buying power can get dangerous and I can see why they choose this route but it does make the game feel very shallow and doesn't give much for people to look forward to. So it comes down to do you explore for the sake of it or you grief other players just cause, which doesn't seem very meaningful.\n\n\nEdit: Also this stupid low fidelity pirate game is somehow 100GBs and it doesn't even feel like it warrants that amount of space besides all the cosmetics they are trying to sell you.

Please Read on.\n[*]When they get the hacking/cheating controlled to any reasonable amount, then you have the bullies issues that are in equal numbers. So the kids that have no friends because they are bullies, and are home without parents, finding a place to continue their misbehavior and bully in a game where there are no consequences.\n[*]My seven year old son, who was infatuated with the Jack Sparrow\u00ae and Pirates of the Caribbean\u00ae franchise, could not wait to play. My son never made it out of the tutorial. He was simply trying to learn to command his ship, before being attacked pointlessly and endlessly. Never got upset, kudos to my son, actually laughed the first few times, and attempted to befriend the attackers. Instead racial insults, vulgar language, unprovoked was out of hand. To now allow a new player to experience the mechanics of your game, is beyond pathetic.\n[*]Do not allow people to learn to play, is about the saddest and insulting production of a game I have encountered in 30 years in the industry. I have seen most of the good and ugly but this game takes the cake.\n[*]Even with waiting a bit, walking away, then returning to inform the attackers that he was new, was accepting of their attacks, the verbal onslaught and vulgar disposition was something I have not seen this bad, continued. When you handle it right, there should be reward and respect. Returned four hours later, literally, still the same nonsense.\n[*]The developers and producers have problems galore, but they focus on cheaters and not the whole picture, and refuse to have GM employment. To their credit they have banned over 16000 accounts in June 2023, and it has not made a dent, and it has made this game a non stop feast for abusers sadly, in what was an exciting video and nostalgic happiness turned quickly to complete deflation.\n\n[h1] As a gamer talking [/h1]\n\nGraphics are cool. Theme is really good from the video. The music and animation is very good from the moment my son loaded in. The FPS was terrific.  The art team has done amazing. If you can get past the bullies, abuse and tutorial, you may enjoy it with a team of friends. The community is toxic as anything I have ever seen in 30 years.

Its essentially a game made for trolls. People just roam around looking for people to kill. Do you want to spend 30 minutes to be someone elses entertainment? Go right ahead. Nevermind that some of the quests are bugged. Got a voyage to deliver cargo to a merchant that doesn't exist anymore. Spent 15 minus sailing here  against the wind because this game makes it so the wind is against you 75% of the time. Can't have you doing things too quickly. Finally get to this location, run all over the island looking for this NPC to deliver cargo to. Turns out they don't exist anymore. While im doing this, a random person rides by and destroys my ship for shits and giggles. Every once in awhile Ill get the urge to play after seeing a picture of the sailing, log in, only to be reminded how flawed this game's design is in the long term. Its been bleeding players for awhile now with 2023 being its worse year to date on steam. Issue is that in order for sea of thieves to work, people need to be \"farming\". Can't have a pirate game when there's nothing to pirate. Well people figured out that they don't want to be someone elses content. To farm for someone elses sake. So they stopped doing that. They either quit like I did or they just roam around looking for things to kill while partaking in no farming of their own. So what happens? The farmers get bored and left cause they don't get any reward. The pirates get bored because of lack of reward and are leaving. They release an update. Tons of people play for a week. Then all those players disappear and goes back to bleeding for another 3-4 months. \n\nDespite its dropping population these past few years, the community is very anti-criticism. If anyone's played a game with a remotely similar process (farmers vs gankers), you'll know how loud the ganker community can be. SoT is sadly no exception. So don't bother discussing anything on forums/subreddits/etc. \n\nMaybe one day if it fully dies they'll do some kind of pve mode where you can just sail around and explore with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1689302364, "timestamp_updated": 1689302364, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507462680339813232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136832336": {"recommendationid": "136832336", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063529912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6186, "last_played": 1682449719}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

This is mostly a patented lie.  Sadly.  \n\nNow before you down load this game, go on youtube and watch how the game is actually played.  This game is Player vs Player battle fest.   Players regularly just walk up to you or your ship and just slaughter you.   The game encourages this behavior, truly encourages it.   \n\nYes there is adventure.  LOTS of it, but you will always be interuppted to such a degree that you practically have to wage guerilla warfare to actually finish most adventures that are part of the content of the game.   This is as the game is designed,  it is not error, it will remain exactly this for as long as Rare owns the game.\n\nAs for Exploration, this is an out and out joke.  The world, even using the in  game \"watch\" that you have times out that the actual area you a playing in is a mere puddle less than 30 miles by 30 miles square.  You could drop that square mile area into one of America's Great Lakes and never touch the shores of that lake.\n\nMany will liken this Sea of Thieves as a \"haven\" for Pirates.  I disagree.  This place is a tiny \"penal colony\" and the Pirate Lord is the warden who controls the way out.   You can't even DIE to get out of this place.  The Ferry Man always sends you back, never ever does he send you ON.\n\nNow to be fair this game is a visual master piece.  I kid you not.  It is a visual master piece.  The Ocean Dynamics is AMAZING.  I have yet to get my mind around the idea that Rare thinks that squarerigged ships can sail dead into a head wind and make progress.  They do in this game, but it is a game \"thing\" that allows the three different ship types to behave in ways that allow them to escape from each other should they choose to.  But, the learning curve to achieve that skill level is steep.\n\nSo visually so gorgeous that even though I have more beefs with this game than any other I have ever played.  I do keep coming back.

It doesn't have content, you make the content with your friends. If you don't like repeating the same activity with long periods of doing nothing in between getting dunked on by players with three times your playtime, then I can't recommend.\n\n\"But it's fun with friends!\" This is, quite obviously, a virtue of your friends rather than the game. Any game is fun with friends. Poking a dead dog in the road is hilarious with friends, you know? Or maybe my friends are just weird. I'll keep playing this game even after this review, but the second my friends stop, so will I. May Davy Jones have mercy on the poor souls who play this game solo.\n\nThis game is slow paced in moment-to moment gameplay. Painfully slow. You might spend more time sailing across empty, lifeless waters than looking for treasure on islands that all feel the same, or shipwrecks that [i] are [/i] all the same. PvE combat features all the complexity or Cookie Clicker, when all you can do is mash left click against hordes of enemies who are powerless to stop you. There is no dodge mechanic, so ranged AI will just flip a coin to decide if their aimbot locks on to you or not. When shot, you can heal to full in about a tenth of the time it takes them to reload. There are no consequences for death either, although losing your ship does mean [i] another [/i] fifteen minutes of restocking supplies and potentially losing all your loot (not that there is anything to buy other than cosmetics).\n\nRecommending this as a chill game is tough too however, because it can turn around in an instant. The moment you randomly meet another player, the gloves come off. Running around a galleon in 4v4 ship combat is amazing, when everyone is yelling out and laughing it's great. Assigning roles, working together and pulling off a dumb strat feels good and usually rewarding. \n\nMostly that's the case. But, a lot of the time, losing might not even be your fault. There's no skill-based matchmaking, so you will either stomp or be stomped 80% of the time, neither of which feel fun. Hitreg in this game is atrocious, and unfortunately it [i] will [/i] decide some fights. Not to mention that the longer you've been on in a session, the more supplies you will have. So sometimes, you might lose a fight before it even starts because the enemy had a ton more wood, or you might win a fight solely because you had like ten overpowered cursed cannonballs. And remember that sinking means more resupplying, losing all your loot and even more waiting!\n\nThere are definitely better games to play with friends. Games with deeper and more entertaining mechanics, stories you can care about and hopefully better servers. But I [i] guess [/i] it's fun with friends, for what that's worth.

It's a chore to play on your own, and by joining an open crew you are literally handicapping yourself.\n\nThe problems with this game are many:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Xbox social is as sluggish and clunky as you'd expect a Microsoft product to be\n    [*]The game is a buggy mess, and every patch introduces something new. You'll get launched off of platforms, black screen back to your boat, get stuck between rocks and trees, get a hit marker but deal no damage, respawn without clothes, lose wind visuals, lose sound, or any multitude of unique and varied bugs that are so extensive and bizarre you'd think you were accidentally setting off anti-piracy measures.\n    [*]New content is almost always a new fort or fleet or other PvE element to fight, and the PvE is truly terrible. Left click to sword, hold left click to sword lunge, left click to shoot, right click to aim down sights, that's it. That's literally it. There's no depth to it, and the big challenges the PvE offers up are either send more enemies, or increase the damage dealt and absorbed by boss type enemies. It's all meant to be means to an end, an obstacle to gate rewards behind and not a thing to be enjoyed in its own right. By design, this creates incentives to drive players to compete over control of the PvE and also the loot earned by completing the PvE, but this is also a problem because...\n    [*]The PvP is also very, very bad. While the sail/wind management and repair triage is fun and strategic, combat is over when one crew manages to put one or two holes in an enemy ship, immobilize it with chainshots, anchor balls, or a good board, and then repeatedly spawn kill the enemies before they have any opportunity to fight back so they are unable to come back. And if you do somehow manage to mess up this process, the entirety of the process simply starts back from square one, because you can then repair every bit of damage done to you and go right back to fighting.\n    [*]Thanks to the Xbox crossplay, this combat is also extremely lopsided. Also, if you join an open crew, you will learn that every last one of these players are incapable of simply breathing like normal people. If you have an Xbox, you are rotund, annoying, and need to stop inhaling Cheetos and start inhaling corticosteroids. Please go outside and stop joining my crew, I know you're not going to help me manage sails no matter how many times I ask.\n    [*]Awful community. Reapers (PvP emissaries) will hunt for sloops docked at islands and sink them without a fight, then run away for an hour the second they face any sort of adversity. It's very rare to meet other crews that don't shoot on sight. Today the galleon of Reapers that ran away from me and my friend accused me of being a p*ssy. They're not wrong, but how could they have known when they were the ones running? They were also terrible at managing their sails, but that's beside the point and not a strike against the game itself.\n    [*]Everything takes so long. Want to collect loot? Pick up each individual piece and walk it back to your boat, and if you really want to optimize it you walk it into harpoon range, drop it, and then harpoon each individual piece the rest of the way. Then you get it back to the outpost and do it all in reverse. Want to join a game and go sail? Gather supplies for five to ten minutes, then raise your anchor (takes ages on larger ships, and you might as well retire if you want to do so on an open crew galleon because you are absolutely doing that on your own), then drop your sails, then turn your wheel, then angle the sails. The game doesn't lend itself well to just playing for a few minutes, because you start fresh on resources every time you boot it up. The devs have made efforts to improve this, and things are way better than they used to be, but at a fundamental level the game will always have you waiting on a bar to fill up so you can put something in a cannon, waiting for the entire reload animation to play so you can shoot your gun again, waiting for the sail to move as you dynamically hold down a single button and watch the mast slowly turn, waiting for the door to slowly open, waiting for the next wave to spawn, waiting for your ship to get to the place you're trying to go. It's a game that takes far too much patience for the average person, and if you join enough open crews you'll realize most people are not even patient enough to raise the anchor and move their ship and will simply keep joining crews until they land on a ship that's already done it for them. (This isn't an indictment of me as a person by the way, I've literally spent 45 minutes rowing across the entire map just to sneak up on another ship and blow them up with kegs just to steal two pieces of loot and it was honestly more fun than playing the game like a normal human being).\n    [*]Too complicated. I understand the game perfectly fine, but I can't for the life of me figure out what is so hard for people to grasp about playing this game but most just never figure it out. People run around in circles on their own boat, smash into rocks and islands, do nothing when you ask them to help you raise sails, stand on the front end of the boat and look at the islands with a telescope, shoot harpoons at a ship well out of range that they could actually catch if they'd just turn the sails, Google every riddle, refuse to repair their own boats, or do anything for themselves. The community is too fragmented between people who know what they're doing and people who just can't figure out how to engage with it in any sort of way, and now that the game has removed Arena they're all here, sharing the same server, ruining each other's good time.\n[/list]\n\nThe game's initial luster wears off pretty quickly once you stop being impressed by the best looking water in all of gaming, the expansive world, the nice looking characters, the top-notch aesthetic, the fun shanties, and the sheer thrill of just being a pirate in a pirate world. That's probably a good way to summarize the issue with the game: it looks excellent and seems exciting and everyone knows that they want a game [i]like[/i] this, but the devs will break two things every time they fix one and fundamentally do not understand that no amount of tutorial popups are going to make sense of the game if it doesn't [i]feel[/i] good to operate. Conceptually, Sea of Thieves is the perfect game, but because its issues are tied to its engine and its entire design philosophy, the only real fix for this game is to wait for somebody with the same idea to finally make a better one.", "timestamp_created": 1668397573, "timestamp_updated": 1668397573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506255626678466797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141962283": {"recommendationid": "141962283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198969192258", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 349, "playtime_at_review": 788, "last_played": 1696143166}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING", "timestamp_created": 1689223705, "timestamp_updated": 1689223705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141961126": {"recommendationid": "141961126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851152012", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1691982201}, "language": "english", "review": "delightful \ni love bombs", "timestamp_created": 1689222116, "timestamp_updated": 1689222116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141961028": {"recommendationid": "141961028", "author": {"steamid": "76561199244803707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 70, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1696206550}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was very thrilling and enjoyable for a lot of people I would highly recommend this game", "timestamp_created": 1689221962, "timestamp_updated": 1689221962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141960159": {"recommendationid": "141960159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003179817", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1692056405}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely love this game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1689220762, "timestamp_updated": 1689220762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137754237": {"recommendationid": "137754237", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379786356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5065, "last_played": 1692463826}, "language": "english", "review": "its a great just make sure u have a good crew to bk you up", "timestamp_created": 1683155094, "timestamp_updated": 1683155094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137155661": {"recommendationid": "137155661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159339994", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1679190119}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, fun concept.

It reveals that it doesn't respect your time just after you become ineligible for an easy refund. The last time people who worked at Rareware disappointed me this badly was when I played the first Yooka Laylee. Pardon the pun, but this game gets BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER by similar titles.\n\nFor the combat and ship maintenance, all it did was make me fondly remember the short hour or so I played Blackwake with friends. This game has mandatory PvP with everyday gameplay, but it has the swordplay and gunplay being so slow and clunky that even clapping skeletons/monsters gets dull. Its flow is like if Dark Souls drank heavily after getting pregnant with a PoTC cosplayer. If you tell a defeated opponent, \"skill issue\" in this, YOU'RE the joke for thinking you demonstrated skill. Someone had to tell you that.\n\nI know pirates were historically the filthy, unattractive shoplifters of the Caribbean, but it implements the anarchistic raiding of piracy ALL WRONG by having no PvE option. Elite Dangerous at least understands that maybe I don't want someone to waltz in uninvited, ruin my chill grind, and set me back by an hour. Focusing on how good the PvE is doesn't work either when this game throws a Kraken at me in the first hour of playing it. You know, the uncommon boss event? So when I see other reviews about the game mention a cheating problem, I have to ask Rare IF THEY'RE EVEN TRYING anymore.\n\nIt breaks my heart to see both Rare and Nintendo's recent releases become mid, AT BEST, considering Banjo-Tooie is an all-time favorite of mine. Port Royale 3 and Sid Meier's old classic were more rewarding to set sail with. Oh, and this game takes 90GB or so to install, so it doesn't respect your disk space either.

With the mountains worth of content in this game, it's sad that I've seen so many pushed away because of the pvp. I got a real nasty warning from twitch as well, because of what one of the assholes I ran into was screaming at us. In my opinion the only thing that could actually allow this game to grow even more than it has, is to add in a pvp free mode, or actually implement the damn private servers outside of the select few that are allowed to use them. Because from what I've seen, this game is shrinking down to only the worst players around, and others are finally seeing how rotten it's become, and refuse to buy, or play the game anymore. The main reson I've seen argued against adding a pve mode to the game is that the game would die, though I think only the pvp would end up dying out, since all the toxic players would be forced to

Just a warning to everyone thinking of buying this game.\n\nIt is full of bugs/glitches that people do take advantage of quite frequently.\n\nThe majority of the player base is EXTREMELY toxic. If you are PvEing and a PvPer comes across you they are going to be toxic.. The usual.... Racism, sexism, homophobia.... Etc... Etc... Etc....\n\nThis also goes happens if you are a PvPer and attack a PvEr....\n\nAlso PvP on PvP. You will come across the occasional nice person but most of them are toxic. \n\nPlaying on PC you WILL come across hackers. This is a guarantee if you play enough.\n\nThis game is great! I won't lie.... But it still needs a lot of work and the devs focus is always in the wrong spot.....\n\nHourglass is a pain to even match with. This is their on demand PvP..... You will spend 15 minutes looking for a match but the timer will say two minutes.\n\nIf you go onto the forums and say anything the toxic base rises up.... Call you a swabbie and to shut up..... \n\nNow I won't lie... I own the game. I play it. I probably will keep playing.... I also put thousands of hours into another game that is also known to be a royal pain in the backside..... \n\nBut the devs genuinely do NOT care about their PvE player base. I PvP and enjoy it.

Gameplay loop is good too.\n\nBut the game's QoL is horrible, every single person I have met in this game is horrid. I'm sure the community is great but so far my social interactions have been getting my ship destroyed while I'm at an Outpost selling my goods twice in a row, getting called slurs by my alliance before getting back-stabbed and murdered, and then getting my ship destroyed yet again while I'm trying to sell my goods at an Outpost.\n\nTHERE ARE MICRO TRANSACTIONS FOR A $40 GAME\n\nQoL: You cannot turn of your microphone, you can select push to talk but your mic will occasionally come through anyway\n\nPvP is not optional, you can't go to a special server where people can't just kill you out of the blue, Outposts, what you'd expect to be a safe haven (since there's a whole game rule about not fighting on outposts), are constantly filled with campers who destroy your ship and sell off all your loot after killing you.  And there are No Private Servers.\n\nProgress is Not Saved Between Sessions: If you're short on time, don't play this game. You can't keep your loot between sessions, it has to be turned in before you log out of the session or it will be completely lost. This can lead to redundant work. \n\nVictims of Harrassment are Punished for being Victims: If you have someone constantly chasing you down, destroying your ship, stealing your loot, or just in general being a griefer, if you scuttle your ship to move else where, that causes you to lose all of your items you might have gathered. The obvious solution is sell your items frequently, but how much good does that do if you're being harassed while you're in the middle of selling them\n\nCommunity: I've genuinely never had a good interaction with anyone playing this game, this game's design incentives distrust, backstabbing, and just all manners of griefing. You can't opt out of PvP or go to a private server like I said, and trying to run away or teleport away from harassment actively punishes you because you lose everything. I have said this. The game rewards shitty, toxic, and rude behaviour, and punishes kindness and peace.\n\nPersonally, I like being nice to people in the multiplayer games I play because I'm talking to human beings and I want everyone I meet to have a good day. I don't enjoy making others miserable. \n\nThere is No Means of Reporting Shitty behaviour. You can only report inappropriate usernames, ship names, and pet names. If someone starts calling you slurs, there's little to be done. \n\n\nToxic Behaviour is fine if you can stop the input. In Team Fortress 2, you can mute, block and report harassment. Sea of Thieves has none of these options.

Even then, Rare has not fixed the half-decade-old bugs that came with the game's entire history. With the inclusion of alliances, players can take on any solo player and win. Not even wits can save you from them. Censorship is massive and any advertising of exploits of any kind, whether it be helpful, counter-exploiting, or not, is enough to get you banned. The Shores of Gold checkpoint exploit would have been the only safe refuge for me against other pirates as only 4% of them have it, but the grind is way too much and it feels like \"pay to play\", but with lots of time instead of money. I will still keep playing from time to time, but as of now, the straw on my back has broken down entirely. I will not recommend the game to anyone unless Rare steps up and fixes bugs like the one for the escape menu.\n\nUpdate: There is currently a massive cheating problem.

If you're looking for a swashbuckling good time, then you need to set sail for Sea of Thieves.\n\nLet's start with the basics \u2013 the visuals. Holy mackerel, this game is gorgeous. The water looks so realistic that I swear I could almost feel the spray on my face. And the attention to detail in the ships and environments is just incredible. I found myself just staring at the scenery and thinking, \"wow, this is one pretty game.\"\n\nBut Sea of Thieves is more than just a pretty face. This game is all about living out your pirate dreams, and it delivers in spades. You'll be sailing the seas, battling other ships, and searching for treasure. And let me tell you, it is one heck of a ride.\n\nThe combat system is simple but satisfying. You'll be wielding swords and firing cannons at your enemies, and every battle feels like a true test of skill and strategy. And when you finally sink that enemy ship and steal their loot? Oh man, it is a rush.\n\nBut what really makes Sea of Thieves shine is the sense of adventure and camaraderie. You can play solo if you want, but the real fun is in teaming up with other players and exploring the world together.

All of the difficulty is artificially inflated by immense health pools. As far as combat goes, that's the only real difference between enemies aside from what weapon they're brandishing. The few instances where the enemy NPCs are entertaining almost always involve other players. Kraken fights and skeleton galleys make for some interesting tension when paired together or with PvP encounters.\n\nThe game is also suffering from being tied up with the Xbox One, where new content is added, player ship count is often reduced to balance server load, so even with additions like PvP matchmaking or just PvP in general, things start to lag behind. This shows in hit registration issues and poor server quality, so even if PvP is the name of your game, the consistency of its quality is dubious at times. Ultimately, while being a huge fan of the PvP, this game would probably serve better with a larger PvE focus with invader type PvP encounters. I don't recommend this game overall.

While there is no real \"progression\" to be had, going out into the world with your friends, exploring, finding treasure and decorating your ship/character is surprisingly rewarding. However, I have to leave a dislike because of two things. \n\n1. (and this is the big one.) The Sloop is EXTREMELY overpowered. So much so that if you have 3 other friends that play this game, rather than being able to enjoy the galleon, you have to try to lobby jump into the same server so that you can run 2 sloops. Because of this, players intent on PvP will simply use said sloop to absolutely decimate you in any other ship. Even a fully manned Galleon with experienced players can not stand against it because of the sloops mobility. Its ridiculous. \n\n2. There is little that players can do to avoid griefing. I am one of the I'm sure thousands of us that work full time and try to play the game. Doing so often means starting solo with an open lobby. Running the now basically mandatory sloop, you are put into a lobby with someone and have no ability to remove that person if say they, idk, decide to sabotage your ship. You can't even so much as remove them without giving up the entirety of your play session to do so. There has been exactly nothing done to correct this and it's always been a problem. The game is far more focused on selling new ship skins and clothing items and special cannons and pets than they are actually giving a damn about the player experience. \n\n\n\nTL:DR- Welcome to the Microtransaction and Griefing hellscape where the sloop is god and nobody cares about the players as long as you keep buying the newest cosmetics.", "timestamp_created": 1665913120, "timestamp_updated": 1665913120, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123658814": {"recommendationid": "123658814", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056036090", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1692414969}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont own this game", "timestamp_created": 1665445166, "timestamp_updated": 1665445166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123493054": {"recommendationid": "123493054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035451150", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 148, "playtime_at_review": 14903, "last_played": 1696451130}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy hell, this game is just mad, i have never had as much fun in a game wile its true there are some toxic people in this game and since it is a pirate game you are bound to run into these people its still really fun\n\nTo say why, i think ill tell you about the few times where through sheer madness me and my crew were able to get a FoF (Fort of Fortune) so me and my friend were on a sloop and decided to to a FoF witch is basically asked to be sunk and we were half way done then i spotted it a tucker (Tuckers are players who will camp world events and then kill ya and take the loot), now when one spots a tucker they normally kill said tucker.\n\nMy crew however running an Order of Souls Emissary and as such only wanted the skulls so we offer'd to share said fort loot witch is a really good deal to most pirates, but the tuckers tried to kill us so we left after pumping them full of blunderbuss shots.\n\nLater we saw the fort still active so we decided to try again, now we ran into a ship that had been sunk by toxic reapers a wile before we got to the fort (witch we sunk said Reapers) now i did not know it at the time but IT WAS THE TUCKERS i did not know tho so we raised an alliance.\n\nSIX BLOODY NAVAL BATTLES later we finished the fort and they told they were the tuckers but we had spilled so much pirate blood together that they decided to honer the agreement and now we have some awesome friends.\n\n10/10 would sail again.\n\nSo TLDR toxic players exist. and PvP is gonna happen A-LOT", "timestamp_created": 1665161432, "timestamp_updated": 1665161432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94159083": {"recommendationid": "94159083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025891349", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6366, "last_played": 1667587564}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a 46 year old dad and I absolutely love playing this with my 13 year old son.

You start the game up, grab some supplies with your friends, load up your ship, and set sail to see what fate awaits you.\n\nI offer this game an easy recommend under a couple of conditions. The first is that you like the chaos of unknown adventure, and the second is that you don't mind when it all goes pear shaped.\n\nSea of Thieves has you being a pirate on the ocean with other players, sailing from island to island, fighting skeletons, ghost ships, digging up treasure, solving riddles, delivering cargo, and fighting sea monsters. And you never quite know what's going to happen next on your adventure. There's plenty of things to chase, and you'll never be without a task for long if you care to pick one up from one of the vendors.\n\nOne important design choice that you should be aware of before jumping into this game is that every session is a fresh start. You spawn in with your ship and bare bone supplies, there's no progression between sessions aside from cosmetics you unlock. (Which is also the only thing you unlock, more on that below). While this can be a bit of a bummer, it's actually quite freeing. Every time you launch the game you're given a new ship, new supplies, and an ocean full of treasure to explore. Truly, you have nothing to lose. Until you find treasure, that is. Then you have something to lose. The game is simply fantastic at giving you a unique adventure every time you sail, solo or with friends. And it's shockingly easy to play solo if you desire, the smallest ship, the Sloop, is very solo player friendly if you wish to be an asocial pirate.\n\nThe only progression in this game is cosmetics. Anything else you get exists solely to get you, you guessed it, more cosmetics. This makes the cash shop a little weird. But hey, the upside is that nobody is going to beat you because they have a better sword, ship, or guns.\n\nThe game recently started a battle pass system with season one. The pass for season one is frankly a little underwhelming. I'm willing to give it a pass since the game is quite enjoyable without, but you're not missing out on anything exciting by not getting the pass.\n\n--Update--\nSince it's been a fair while and four full seasons since I first wrote this review, I felt it was time for an update. Overall, I still stand by the original review, with the same disclaimer that you have to be able to accept the wins and losses both in this game. It certainly can be frustrating at times but much like the ship, you have to let it roll off you like water. If you let the bad moments cling to you like barnacles, then you'll be just as scuttled as your ships.\n\nSeason Five just launched, and after a middling Season 2, Content Packed Seasons 3 and 4, Season 5 could be called the quality of life season. There's a decent chunk of new content (though nothing like the previous seasons, which is a reasonably high bar; 5 story missions in season 3, and roughly 8 or so new explorable lootable areas for season 4?)\n\nThe biggest quality of life change in S5 is being able to quickly and easily transfer resources from barrels and storage crates without having to open the interface. This along probably would have given me another 100 hours in the game, but they also decided to add a buried treasure system! Indeed, you can bury your treasure to create a treasure map. Then, you can put that map up on the quest board at any outpost! Other pirates can take this, and if they successfully sell your treasue...boom! You get rewarded too. How fantastic is that?\n\nIt's even better than that though. You can take up to five treasure pers per in game day from the board (this amount is pretty reasonable I feel, the days go quickly in the sea of thieves), and these other player maps will contain buried treasure of their own. Of course. Quality of treasure may vary, as it could be anything. Though there are commendations to encourage big, fruitful treasure maps. Really, it's a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.\n\nThe best part of the whole treasure map system though? They're saved on your quests table as an item called a Map Bundle. What's that mean? It means if you sink, you lose your maps and need to recover the bundle. Or that other people could steal your maps. Or you could steal their maps, I guess, if you're a jerk. While the idea that you can lose your treasure maps may feel a bit unfortunate, it's lovely design because it means they're transferable, you could gift the map bundle, or simply leave it at an outpost when you're done for someone else to find. It adds excitement in that the treasure you buried could be yoinked by a boarder and carried away. Or that you could recover your stolen bundle to regain your rightful treasure. It adds another layer of things for pirates to bicker and barter over, and it means that should things go bad for all involves, the treasue may be lost to all.\n\nThe game has been at it's best when it balances the thrill of gain with the risk of lose (even though the sting of loss can be quite painful, it's something we must learn to accept). Remember, the whole ocean is open to you, so long as you go in with the attitude that what happens, happens.", "timestamp_created": 1611931172, "timestamp_updated": 1638464532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 333, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.950918912887573242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102884644": {"recommendationid": "102884644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969528423", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 2227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2145, "last_played": 1642271928}, "language": "english", "review": "I learned french from people in this game.\nThey asked for a banana then killed me.\nBut now i can understand them, and not fall to this bait again.", "timestamp_created": 1637075610, "timestamp_updated": 1637075610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 694, "votes_funny": 769, "weighted_vote_score": "0.95417708158493042", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75077674": {"recommendationid": "75077674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303908052", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 141314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14432, "last_played": 1691340486}, "language": "english", "review": "Well after reaching Pirate Legend and Athena's fortune Champion titles,\nI'm finally able to make a review of this game, I hope it will help you decide if this game is worth it! I'll probably update this review the further I play. For now I'll be talkin about the [b]Adventure mode[/b] :)\n\nPros :\n-Cool graphics and simulation of a pirate life.\n-It's a game where you either get addicted or hate it in the first hours.\n-Funnier with friends or randoms, but you'll learn so much faster in solo trust me.\n-Satisfying sensation when you sink ennemies boats and grab their loot.\n-Good game if you want to chill and kill time (but sometimes it can be stressful especially if you have a lot of loots and you're getting focused by a reaper or red flag emissaries).\n-Active developer team (monthly updates, quick reactivity on problems in-game through their tweeter, so I would recommend to follow them there to not miss a thing and to always be aware of what's happening).\n\nCons:\n-Intensive grind.\n-Boring after a while.\n-Lack of content eventhough it was way worse back when it came out in 2018.\n-FPS optimization is a joke on islands (At full ultra I go from 120fps to 55 fps on big islands).\n-PVP mechanic is old and boring (idk maybe they need to add some new guns or mechanics).\n-Bugs after new updates are not even a surprise anymore.\n-Servers issues is normal and the community is used to it (so an advice would be to never do an event the day it comes out because you probably won't receive your loot's coins, XP and achievements).\n-Some events are only visible on their website and not in-game so sometimes you can miss them (Just stop it, we are lazy and hate to go through google to see our fck in-game event progression, just put it in game already ffs it's 2020).\n\nOverall the game has a lot of problems but I still love the concept it does represent otherwise I wouldn't have reach one of the highest titles you can earn and I hope this game will continue to get the support it deserves. I haven't played such a great game in a while, so if you like intensive farming, bugs, coop and pvp but also the big map you're in the right place. We'll be waiting for you on the ocean :)\n\nPS: If you're a veteran please help new players and don't bully them, that's what I do and I would have loved to be helped too when I started, so please do so they will always remember you, thanks fellow Legends.\n\n\n\n\nEdit1: So after 3 months, the game is still awesome, probably one of the best open world in multiplayer that I've played in a while. Nothing better but to fish with friends during late nights.\n\n\n\n\nEdit2: They finally added an Even tab in-game! Anyway I've been playing [b]Arena[/b], joined a competitive team and reached Legendary Sea Dog. So the Arena mode is way different from the actual game (adventure). It also have its pros and cons so here we go :\n\nFor the positive aspects :\n- Helps you improve cannon shots\n- Helps you improve your weapon accuracy\n- TDM (Team deathmatch) is a lot of fun! It's like the endgame community event in the Arena\n- You can make friends in this mode\n- Since the last Arena patch, there's only one chest now and it's way better than before\n\nSome negative aspects :\n- Hitregs (When you hit players usually with weapons and you have the hitmarker but the server didn't register the damage, so sometimes you'll need to hit 3-4 time the player before he dies, and sometimes you may think they're cheater)\n- Lobby waiting time : because the Arena mode is not the main mode, the playerbase is not that big here, so you might wait 10-30min in the worst case...\n- Server region merge : Yeah well sometimes there's no server in EU (in my exemple) at certain hours and I usually get matched with NA players and I have an average of 200-250ms\n- FPS optimization (Even on High-End PC you'll probably struggle to maintain a stable 144fps\n\nEdit3:\nThey removed their own game mode called Arena.

They gave me treasures, helped me do quests and all for the price of an Uber (get them to a location). They were AWESOME, FUNNY and HELPFUL as hell. Best pirate experience with them.\n\nAfter I dropped them off there, I did several quests, I ran from other players as they were chasing me, I managed to DEFEAT another ship in a 1v2 situation, stole their loot, ran away, sold it, it was epic.\n\nAll this in 4 freaking hours!\n\nEven if the quests are some kind of repetitive, the PvP element is awesome!.\n\nI don't regret any money spent on it, too bad I don't have any friends playing this masterpiece.\n\nPositive review, as I haven't had bugs or unpleasant gameplay. \n\n\nPS: Great optimization also, 2080S + 4790K, 1440p, Mythical graphics (max), 100 fps. Amazing!\n\n\nPart 2 (10 hr gameplay): \n\nSo I played again, 2nd gameplay, I finished first 3 Tales and it was a \"good\" gameplay.\n\nThis time I haven't seen a single friendly person. I've been attacked and raided about 6-7 times, sometimes by solo, sometimes by gang of 3-4. But I adapted quickly.\n\nAt first I went to cash in my voyages and treasures ( i had 3 chests with 9 skulls, 3 chests with 9 gold items, a crying chest and 2 regular treasure chests, all from farming/voyage). I went to an outpost, I did a 360 to make sure there's nobody there, then docked the sloop. When I went with the first chest of 3 skulls, there was a dude hiding in a bush next to the Bones tent, he jumped out, gave me a heart attack, then took a shot at me. He missed the shot, I dropped the chest and I went full ape on him, killing him. Then I ran to drop all my treasures, cause since he didn't have a boat, meant his team mates are circling around. On that run I felt like mom's spaghetti, palms were much sweatyyy... \n\nAmazingly, I managed to cash in ALL my treasures, and THEN, the bad guys were aready at my ship. I saw them trying to ram it in the rocks. I throw 2-3 blast bombs and they drop in water, then I shoot them down with the pistol. Managed to get back in my ship, repair it , and went full speed into their big ship, while they were respawning. I didn't stay to repair mine, I just shot their ship down, then ran away.\n\nThen I got killed and ship sank about 4 times, twice from crew of 4 , once from a duo on a sloop, they put a barrel on my ship and sank it down, while I was doing a quest ... and once from the freaking kraken, right AFTER I FINISHED A TALE...  Lost a lot of treasures including the Tale treasure, but....\n\nWhile trying not to ragequit, I saw a crew of 4 again, probably same guys, they were fighting a skeleton ship. I got close and managed to spot 2 of the 4 guys, confirming it was the crew that gangbanged me (i think ^_^ ) . I went to them, flanked them and placed them between me and the skull ship. Shot them 3-4 times, then with a singing/dancing cannonball and a fire cannonball, and their ship started to sink and burn. I saw them jumping in the water. I went there to see if they \"need\" help and just finished the job, shooting them in the water. Then I took ALL their treasures, which compensated a lot over my loss, and went to a safe outpost.\n\nThat feeling was the best. Yes, I lost some battles, but also won a few. First gameplay, 4 hours, 2nd gameplay, 10 hours straight. The PVP element is priceless in this game, otherwise it would've become boring. \n\nAnd I just found out about sunken ships, mermaids skeleton lords and kraken :)) \n\nNew challenges ahead !!!\n\nEdit 3: 18-June-2020\n\nI think I had enough of this game. While there are 3-4 random people/ships that are friendly, most of the players I've encountered in the last days are simply apes. \n\nI see medium ship with 3 people, I run fast at outpost and manage to sell every treasure, sail away, they chase me for 10 minutes, until I stopped to see what they want. They simply killed me on sight.\n\nI see sloop with 2 people chasing me, my ship is empty, I tell them ship is empty, and that I'm going on a Tale, they simply sank my ship.\n\nFinally, I have +10 skulls, 9 gems, 10 treasure chests. I see galeon with 4 people, I avoid it, I run to outpost and manage to sell everything.\nThen I go on a tale, they simply start chasing me. I tell them I am solo, ship is empty, they start firing at me. I do a handbrake 180'Turn, run against the wind, somehow they catch me sideways (AGAINST THE WIND, they say sloop is fastest against wind). They hit me with hook, take me away from my ship, in the middle of the ocean. I respawn, they are in my ship, burning it down.\nAll 4 of them were like \"SORRY MAN, WE THOUGHT YOU HAD LOOT, SORRY WE SANK YOUR SHIP, SORRY WE KILLED YOU 3 TIMES\".\n4v1, 2 of them were LEGENDS, I am a fucking bamby learning the game, two of them have +500 hours in game.\n\nThis is fucking pathetic. Instead of going to fight the 3-crew ship, they chose to chase a 1-crew Sloop with no fucking loot.\n\nIn the last 2 days I haven't seen a single friendly dude. Everybody tried to shoot/sink my ship.\n\nAt some point, I get to think this game is filled with low ego real life underachievers... for ganging up a fking solo.\n\nI tend to Change my review to No, since there's no fun in getting chased every 5 minutes by crew of 3-4 people that have nothing better to do than bullying a solo player with empty ship.\n\nPS: Even with apes chasing me on the sea, in solo mode, I managed to make almost 80K Gold in one gameplay and only lost 1 treasure chest to apes.\n\nEdit 4: I've played a bit before my holiday and for some reason, it was surprisingly amazing. I joined as usual, as a solo Scoop, but I forgot to set it to Private. After about 5 minutes, I get a random crew member who scared the living thing out of me... lel... He was a legend, he was very funny and helpful. For some reason, he didn't mind playing with me and helping me do tales and treasure hunting. I believe I wanted to play for half an hour, and ended up playing a 8-hour session with him, talking about the game and telling jokes and chilling at some  \"grog\". \n\nWe've had also some fair PvP, 2v2 and 2v3, which sometimes went good ,sometimes went to shit when we fell of the ship and they stole our ship and sank it into a cliff. \n\nI haven't tried the new update yet, but I can surely say, you cannot play \"just a half hour session\"... 4 sessions ... 30 hours... that says it all.", "timestamp_created": 1591725879, "timestamp_updated": 1629218530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 730, "votes_funny": 132, "weighted_vote_score": "0.947013914585113525", "comment_count": 57, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88639619": {"recommendationid": "88639619", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092202209", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29897, "last_played": 1659737280}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of thieves is fun for all ages.

The game has story line aspects with its \"Tall Tales\" or you can get voyages to kill off Captain skeletons, battle skeleton and ghost ships, find lost merchandise in sunken ships or good old fashion treasure hunting. There are \"world events\" that rotate throughout the day this includes skeleton fleets, skeleton forts, fire tornadoes that spawn in \"boss\" enemies and the infamous \"Flameheart\" and his ghost fleet.\n\nI find the game has a good balance of PvE and PvP, so you are able to attack player ships and vice versa. Plus, during your voyages surprise attacks from megladons, krakens and even a skeleton ship can attack. This game keeps you on your toes and wanting more.

I've done pretty much everything you can do around here and max level'd all the companies.\n\n-Graphics are stunning for the most part, especially the sea. Characters do look goofy but thats not a bad thing. \n\n-Pve is fun at first 100-200 hours or so but gets repetitive after a while.\n\n-Gold system is just stupid. I've bought everything in the game and still have millions of gold and thousands of dubloons just sitting there with nothing to spend them on. They need to balance it more. either add more stuff to buy, make it more expensive or decrease the loot you gain.\n\n-To basically summarize the pve, there are 7 emmissary companies in this game. They will give you quests and bonuses on the items you sell if you're sailing with their emmisary flag.\n\nEMMISARIES\n\nGold Hoarders.\nThey give you treasure hunt quests where you gotta dig up stuff from random islands. That's all they used to do until they introduced the vaults in a recent update. Vaults are a lot more fun. You gotta put together the map for a key then go to a specific island where the key will unlock a cave. You will see a lot of gold and chests laying around in there but those are just a distraction. Your main goal will be to get the Chest of Tributes by collecting madallions and entering the correct sequence to open sesame as it were.\nThey only give you bonus for treasure chests and small collectibles like chalices and ornate cups and whatnot.\n\nMerchants.\nMost boring emmisary of all. Just delivering cargos from one place to another. They give you bonus for selling cargo items like sugar, tea etc.\n\nOrder of Souls.\nBasically a skeleton killing faction. They give you bounties to kill some skeleton captains and they will give you a bonus for selling them their skull. There's also ghost fleets which are much more fun and giving bigger rewards.\nThey only give you bonus for selling skulls.\n\nReapers.\nThe ''pvp'' faction of adventure mode. I just call them garbage collectors of this game because they will give you bonus for literally everything. Anything you got you thought was worthless, they will buy it. They buy everything. They dont give you any quests. There are a couple items that you can only sell to them. Reapers Chest and Reapers Bounty but beware these chests are cursed and their positions are revealed on the map. So other players may see you. If you're flying reaper emissary flag they will see you. BUT, if you reach level 5 emmisary you will be able to see other emmisaries on the map to hunt them down. You get really good money for selling broken emmisary flags of those people you sank. \n\nThe reason I said ''pvp'' faction is because a lot of reaper players are known to just run soon as they see you. Yes. It's supposed mean ''hey guys, you can see us on the map, we're up for some pvp, come get us'' but they raise it to get more money from the items they sell and just keep doing pve. \n\nDon't raise reaper if you're gonna run from the first ship you see. If you get sunk, they will be toxic to you naturally and you will deserve it because you made them waste an hour chasing you down. \n\nHunters.\nFishermen. You can fish in this game and sell your fish to these guys at any seapost. Best way to level up on hunters is to save your gems to sell it to them only(you can sell gems to everyone pretty much). It's a lot more xp and gold than fishin.\n\nAthena.\nThe emmisary you unlock by reaching pirate legend. Pretty boring voyages and overrated rewards. I was disappointed. It was supposed to be some big endgame company where it'd be fun stuff but its meh.\n\nSea dogs.\nArena company. Arena is a seperate gamemode than adventure where its ONLY pvp. Just constant action for 15 minutes straight. Huge fun. I love their cosmetics too. Really the coolest and most posh stuff ever lol\n\nWORLD EVENTS\n\nThese are where you enjoy some of the best of pve this game can offer. Rewards are pretty huge compared to regular emmisary voyages.\n\nFlameheart\nGiant Bearded Face in the sky screaming at you all the time. Everyone hates him. You fight his ghost fleet. Reward is plenty and you also get a lot of supplies.\n\nAshen Winds.\nBoss on an island. Decent rewards, you also get a unique cool flamethrower skull that you can sell for 10k. Not bad.\n\nSkeleton Fleet.\nProbably the most challanging pve i'd say. Especially if you're in a small ship. But the loot haul is pretty big. Fastest way to level up your emmisary flag because of the high quantity of items you'll get.\n\nActive Forts.\nSkeleton waves and then a boss. You get decent loot. \n\nFort of the Damned.\nBiggest loot haul you can get from this game. But beware, people will try to steal it from you. This is the number 1 event every server hopper can dream of. It's the main attraction for pvp. Really the most fun thing to do/steal in adventure mode.\n\n-------------------------\n\nPVP.\n\nNow for the best part of this game, PVP. It gives you a pleasure that other pvp games can't. It's just a really unique experience battling it out as pirates. I don't even do any pve anymore it's all about pvp.\n\nI'll see if I can summarize the key parts of it, but oh boy it's beautifully complicated. \n\n-There's the naval part where you have to out-manuever your enemy. You have to stay out of their broadside while try to get them in your broadside while they're doing the same thing. It's not just a spinning battle where both ships constantly fire at eachother like in the Caribbean movies. There's unique moves you can pull off with harpoon turning, anchor turning, adjusting sails to surprise your enemy. Having a good captain will make all the difference between winning or losing a battle. \n\n-Cannons. Different types of cannonballs for different purposes, regular cannons to put some holes in, cursed balls with million different (and very useful) purposes, firebombs to put their ship ablaze, blunderbombs to damage players knock them back from repairing. and in my opinion the best type is the chainshots to knock their mast down. Because soon as you're unable to move, you're done. You will just be sitting ducks for the volley of cannonfire soon to follow. Having a good gunner who hits their shots in good sequence will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.\n\n-Repairing. Every crew needs a good bilge rat who makes sure that the ship is in top shape. You can't just ignore the holes in your ship to do anything else like boarding or shooting. Not sinking yourself is the priority. Worry about sinking your enemy later. A good bilge rat in your crew will make all the difference between winning and losing the battle.\n\n-Boarding. Without a doubt the most fun thing to do in this game. Boarding other people and killing them. 1 boarder who can put the enemy's anchor down and keep them busy just for a little while is usually good enough to win a battle. You dont even have to really kill them usually. Because as they are busy with the boarder, the other crew member will continue putting the pressure with cannonfire and putting more holes. They won't be able to really focus on repair while they have an active boarder. \n\nOn the othere hand, as fun as it is, too much boarding can be the downfall of a bad crew. Disorganized, if you send too many boarders and they either miss the target or die without doing significant damage, you will be severely undermanned in your own ship to survive the enemy's cannonfire or boarders. I've seen people just all abandoning their ship with holes in it to board ours, we just kill them and theres nobody left to repair them. Come on people. Take care of your ship. Your ship must come first.\n\nTL:DR\n\nThere's so much more to it than I can fit in this review. Really a rich game with a vast world. It's well worth buying at full price. A must buy if you're really into pirate's life. One thing I must say though, you gotta play it with friends. x10 more fun.

It does a masterful job of blending the complexity of sail and wind management, ship-to-ship cannon-play, and a variety of sailing mechanics to create a brilliant seafaring experience!\n\n[b]\u2795 THE WATER.[/b] THE WAVES AND WATER IN THIS GAME: U.N.B.E.L.I.E.V.A.B.L.E! \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\n\n[b]\u2795 The ART.[/b] In fact, the *ENTIRE* art style of the game is undisputedly STUNNING! From the golden shores to the volcanic frontiers, the game is built on [i]National Geographic[/i]-quality landscapes!\n\n[b]\u2795 BETTER WITH FRIENDS.[/b] This can\u2019t be understated enough: [b]the seas can be a ROUGH place\u2014both when it comes to gameplay AND the people you meet along the way. Bring a crew so you don\u2019t have to face it alone! \ud83d\udcaf[/b]\n\n[b]\u2795 HORIZONTAL PROGRESSION.[/b] The game has no vertical progression; there\u2019s no \u201cleveling up\u201d to become a better pirate with better equipment or gain any mechanical advantage over your opponents. The playing field is level every time you roll a new ship\u2014apart from your personal knowledge and mastery of the game mechanics!\n\n[b]\u2795 The OPEN WORLD and the \u201cINFINITE QUEST LOOP.\u201d[/b] While the world is your oyster to explore the moment you leave the dock, there\u2019s also an incredibly brilliant \u201cquest loop\u201d that emerges as you discover expeditions and unlock special emissary quests as you gain their favor. The game rewards you with better and quicker rewards the longer you play\u2014making it incredibly easy to lose yourself for HOURS on end!\n\n[b]\u2795 The STORY VOYAGES (aka \u201cTALL TALES\u201d).[/b] Much of the game\u2019s lore is presented in story voyages known as Tall Tales. These concise, open world stories are a *fantastic* way to explore the world and learn about the magic that drives the [i]Sea of Thieves[/i]. (There\u2019s even checkpoints to save your progress in case you\u2019re ganked by some salty pirate!)\n\n[b]\u2795 HUMOR![/b] As is typical in most Rare games, there\u2019s a glorious, tongue-in-cheek humor woven throughout the gameplay and narrative experience. The world doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, which helps you get lost in the joy of the game!\n\n[b]\u2795 The LIVESTREAM COMMUNITY.[/b] Where the game falls short of teaching the game and community norms, the streaming community is a BRILLIANT resource to fill in those gaps. Take the time to tune in and find a few favorite streamers:\n[list][*] [url=https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Sea%20of%20Thieves]Sea of Thieves on Twitch[/url][/list]\n\n[hr][/hr][h1]\ud83d\udfe1 THE...\"TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT\"[/h1][hr][/hr]\n[b]\u3030\ufe0f QUESTS (aka \u201cVOYAGES\u201d).[/b] Voyages are quests offered by the trading companies that help you grow your wealth. Each company only offers two or three *unique* voyages, and while there is some randomness inherent to each voyage, they will begin to feel repetitive after (admittedly) several hundred hours of adventuring.\n\n[b]\u3030\ufe0f HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.[/b] On one hand: the mechanics are relatively straightforward, simple to pick up, and offer room to master a multitude of tricks that\u2019ll give you the upper-hand in a fight.\n\nOn the other: long animations, hit-reg issues, and a lack of \u201cweight\u201d to your hits can make it feel like you\u2019re dueling with wet pool noodles.\n\n[b]\u3030\ufe0f \u26a0 SAFETY PROTOCOLS: DISENGAGED \u26a0[/b] The moment you set sail, you\u2019ll be with the greenest of green sailors and the hardest, saltiest, most cutthroat pirates on the waves. Though skeleton ships will help you practice and prepare for the PvP encounters you\u2019ll inevitably face, there\u2019s no real, \u201csafe\u201d space to hone your skills as you play\u2014a daunting hurdle to overcome early in the game experience.\n\n[b]\u3030\ufe0f The PLAYERS[/b] \u2026are truly a mixed bag. Some days you\u2019ll make meaningful connections with pirates who are humble in victory, merciful through teaching, or powerful allies on the seas. Other days, you\u2019ll encounter the most toxic, unfeeling players whose singular goal is to break your spirit. All you can do is be prepared for both\u2026\n\n[b]\u3030\ufe0f FISHING.[/b] While fish are both a source of nourishment and highly-desired by the fishing guild, the fishing mechanics themselves aren\u2019t that interesting, and sadly feel like more of a time sync than an enjoyable minigame with meaningful rewards.\n\n[b]\u3030\ufe0f The LACK OF SEA LIFE.[/b] While not game-breaking in any way, the variety of ocean life is sadly lacking in an otherwise STUNNING game... \ud83d\ude1e\n\n[hr][/hr][h1]\ud83d\udca2 THE NOT-SO-GREAT[/h1][hr][/hr]\n[b]\u2796 The game DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR TIME.[/b] My biggest complaint with [i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is the fact that *every* mechanic is built to waste your time. Whether seeking out tiny dig spots on massive islands, fighting waves of skeletons for hours, or fighting a fish for no less than several minutes, the game is [i]NOT[/i] friendly if you\u2019re looking to jump in for any less than two hours at a time.\n\n[b]\u2796 The game does very little TEACHING.[/b] While the Maiden Voyage is a good place to learn the basic mechanics of the game, it doesn\u2019t go into great depth and fails to cover several critical mechanics to the experience: including wind angles, bailing and repairing in combat situations, cannon mechanics, etc.\n\n[b]\u2796 POWER TO THE PVP\u2019ERS \u2694[/b] Each content update seems to strengthen the position of PvP\u2019ers in the game. Whether empowering the PvP faction\u2014the Reapers\u2014or creating deeper time-syncs that put PvE players at a disadvantage, it\u2019s a trend that makes it more and more difficult to enjoy the PvE aspects of the game without confronting the PvP world.\n\n[b]\u2796 The game relies on XBOX LIVE.[/b] While this unifies all of the different platforms under a single account, the XBL service is clunky when it comes to making, inviting, or communicating with friends.\n\n[b]\u2796 The PIRATE CODE is more what you'd call \u201cguidelines\u201d than actual rules\u2026[/b] The code is a reminder of what the game proposes in a community and where it consistently falls short of nurturing that environment.\n\n[b]\u2796 CHARACTER CREATION.[/b] While character creation guarantees a\u2026\u201dgruff\u201d selection of pirates, it can be frustratingly limited if you\u2019re particular about the look of your character..\n\n[hr][/hr][h1]\ud83e\udd14 THE FINAL WORD\u2026[/h1][hr][/hr]\n[i]Sea of Thieves[/i] is a truly fantastic game held back by its indifference to the player experience and an insufferable community\u2026and while some days will create some of your most memorable experiences in gaming, others will make you regret every hour you\u2019ve invested to get there.\n\n[quote][h2]\u2b50 [b]OVERALL: 8.5/10[/b][/h2][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1631471678, "timestamp_updated": 1696175218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 313, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.936696648597717285", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116394636": {"recommendationid": "116394636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041607783", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 163, "playtime_at_review": 2551, "last_played": 1695935811}, "language": "english", "review": "Greay fun.

Then it was 100 hours. 250. 500. Finally, I told myself if I could play 1,000 hours of Sea of Thieves by my anniversary in the game (Nov 25th, 2020), I would write the review. Here I am delivering that promise early. So, do I recommend Sea of Thieves? Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Sea of Thieves is not only my favorite game that I am playing now but has quickly become my favorite game I have ever played. Amongst my crew, there has been a joke that Sea of Thieves is not a game, but more a lifestyle. If you fall in love with this game like me, you will fully understand what this means. But is Sea of Thieves right for you?\n\nI. What is Sea of Thieves?\nSea of Thieves is an adventure sandbox game where you craft your own adventure -- where no two play sessions are ever the same. One day you could be running Gold Hoarders, doing X marks the spot maps, hopping island to island in search of glittering gold. Suddenly while sailing to Crooks Hollow, the water turns black. The Kraken. The next day you could be running Reaper chasing another Reaper into the Shores of Gold for an hour and a half for what turns out to be a f*****g ancient goblet. The adventure and story to be told is yours and always unexpected.\n\nThe nature of Sea of Thieves is PvPvE. This means that you will have emergent threats like Skeleton Ships, Megalodons, or the fearsome Kraken. There are world events like forts where you fight through waves of skeletons to claim a vault of treasure, Ashen Winds where you fight a fiery boss, and skeleton fleets that have you putting your naval skills to the test; however, there is always looming the possibility that other player pirates might have their eyes on that same treasure. It cannot be avoided, you will run into other players in Sea of Thieves. (PvE servers will never happen.)\n\nPlayer interactions can be the most amazing moments, or events that cause you to break your keyboard. I have met great friends, amazing communities, and some of the most salty, homophobic, and racist individuals to walk the planet. I don\u2019t want this to scare anyone though because the number of good encounters far outweighs the bad ones. If you do have a really toxic encounter, I highly encourage clipping the events and sending a player report into Rare (their support system is one of a kind). \n\nII. Is Sea of Thieves Right for You?\nDo you want to be a pirate? Do you love adventure? Do you have friends to play with? Then this game is absolutely for you. While it is not required to have other players to play the game, it is much more enjoyable with company. My crews and I have had such incredible and epic adventures that we will reminisce on them months after they have happened. With friends, you will write your stories of gold and glory. On the other side, I am also a player that enjoys the solitude of the seas and will solo sloop. This play style hardens you to the game and will make you a much better pirate. Beware though, you will sink. A lot.\n\n\u201cSink or be Sunk\u201d. Remember these words when playing this game. You will sink other ships, but you will also sink. No one is immune. Sea of Thieves can be a rough game, but if you get good at the game, it is one of the most satisfying feelings possible. Everyone starts somewhere, and you as a new player will probably end up sunk a lot while you learn to \u2018get good\u2019. Do not lose faith you sweat lord in training you.\n\nIf you are the type of player that enjoys griefing and/or using hate speech, then please move on. As mentioned before, Rare does not mess around with player reports. I have had two really horrendous encounters and on both occasions the crews were suspended fast (the last one taking all of 3 hours from submit of report to email saying they were suspended). I will find you, and clip you, and report you, and then hunt you down until you leave the server. That is a promise.\n\nIII. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Well?\nGraphics: \nThe graphics in Sea of Thieves are just stunning. It is the most beautiful game, nay art, I have ever seen. I dare say the in game water looks more beautiful than real water. There are times that my crew is slightly intoxicated and just staring into the sea as the sun sets below the horizon. I have never taken so many screenshots and clips than I have in Sea of Thieves. Your pirate might look a little weird, but you will grow such an attachment to your pirate that it becomes a bond. I love my strangely long torsoed old man pirate very much. \n\nThe World:\nIn the game you will visit different regions of the Sea of Thieves that all have their own look and personality. You may go to The Wilds which looks gloomy and eerie with the worst storms in the game, or the Devil\u2019s Roar with its active volcanoes that rain ash and molten stone onto unlucky ships. You may also go and take a break in the tropical paradise of The Shores of Plenty. Alongside the main map are areas you can only get to by doing the \u201cstory mode\u201d Tall Tales. The world of Sea of Thieves is rich and alive, with water that thrashes your ship around and shifting winds that require you to maintain your mast position to travel faster. \n\nIV. What Does Sea of Thieves Do Wrong?\nHit reg:\n\"In areas of intense action, players may find themselves firing shots or landing strikes that do not cause damage to their targets. While small improvements continue to be delivered during our regular updates, we are continuing to investigate and identify further improvements to improve the player combat experience.\u201d Expect to see this forever.\n\nBugs/Glitches:\nWith any game there are things that need to be ironed out, and Sea of Thieves is not spared from that. I have been rocket launched off a capstan, had a meg flip my ship six tiles North on death, been stuck in emotes to crewmates (this one is actually really amazing). You will rage and cry with laughter at some of the bugs in this game. Beware to Steam players though, every other update seems to cause a tab out delay bug where if you tab out/in, there is a 3 second delay each way. \n\nV. Conclusion/ TLDR\nSea of Thieves is the adventure that you make of it. You will sink, and you will learn from the times you get sunk. Never give up, because there is no other game like Sea of Thieves. It truly is the best game ever made. As the Great Pirate Lord Ramsey says, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the Gold. It\u2019s about the Glory.\u201d May the wind be in all your sails.\n10/10 Must Buy. \n\n\u2013 DaFoool \n\nWhat was Hour 1,000 Day like?\nI thought it important to describe what Hour 1,000 Day on the Sea of Thieves brought me. My crew mate and I sank, and got sunk. We encountered toxic players, and angels. We tried to lure out some spice by doing a Fort of Fortune. Upon finding a tucker in a barrel on top of a water tower, we performed an incredible kill by feigning ignorance while \u201csearching\u201d the tower as my partner got a sniper shot ready for the blunder bomb that I delivered after (he was a great sport about it all.) He came back once and after a great fight, we sank him. At the end of the night, after depositing our karma crates on the pier of Golden Sands, we noticed a brig coming to sell from an Ashen Winds event. We scuttled our ship and hid. They turned out to be the most incredible kids who loved the game (one of their \u201cbig bwudas\u201d introduced him. Awe!) We emoted, the kid gave an amazing toast in the tavern, and we let them shoot us out of the cannons while we logged midair. I can\u2019t express how amazing and truly wonderful this game really is. Be a good person, treat others with kindness, and remember, on the other side of the pirate is a person.

Paired with the fantastic water effects and the day/night cycle, the world feels uplifting from minute 1. You can practically smell the crisp, salty air... \n\n\n[h1]The learning curve:[/h1]\nReasonable. You can master the basics within the first hour, and then spend the next 100 hours living your best piratey life.\n\n\n[h1]The play style:[/h1] \nInterestingly enough, you don't level up your weapons, skills, or ship's abilities. The changes are purely cosmetic... and I love it. While I've enjoyed games that require you to level up your gear or unlock moves, this style feels much more comfortable. YOU get to decide if you want to invest time in a quest chain that unlocks a new item (a cool ship's livery, a flashy new hat), but you aren't penalized for being a newcomer. Yes, the fancy canons look nice, but they are just as powerful as the default canons. \n\nYou build your reputation with different factions (aka Companies), which leads to unlocking better paying gigs (aka Voyages) and cool-looking items. This works to the benefit of everyone in your crew: A sailor who has a higher rank with a specific Company than their crewmates will be able to pick up a better-paying Voyage, and then everyone in their crew can participate. I love this-- if you happen to outrank your friends/crewmates, you can offer to buy that Voyage. Some aspects of play require everyone to be on the same page (ie, Tall Tales), but that's ok. Means you can have a positive experience doing one-off Voyages some times, and other times hunker down and work toward longer gameplay arcs. \n\n\n[h1]My experience so far:[/h1]\nI played the beta, but only recently bought the game. Even though I missed a massive gap of updates, I don't feel left behind. I love going on adventures with my friends, or winding down the evening with some solo-slooping. I live in a different timezone than my crew, which has meant I have time earlier in my evenings to invest in the pre-adventure prepwork (gathering supplies for the ship, fishing and cooking said fish so we'll have extra stamina). It's fun, and is surprisingly soothing. \n\nPVP has been interesting. When I solo, I try to avoid conflict. When I'm with my crew, we meet it head-on! Both dynamics are enjoyable: Being stealthy, hiding behind mountains, darting around the map, versus gearing up and letting the cannons fly...! So good. \n\n\n[h1]Why I especially like this game (and why you might like it too):[/h1]\nI'm a fan of all things nautical, and I come from a WoW background. For me, this feels like the best parts of WoW: You can tackle massive monsters with your friends, you can choose to grind for random achievements, and you can spend as much time as you want getting sidetracked by treasure and exploration. Plus, the outfits/livery options...! Since the outfits and ship details are purely cosmetic, you can mix and match to your heart's content. \n\n[h1]I imagine you would NOT like this game if:[/h1]\n-- You only have 10 minutes of spare time to play games.\n-- You hate everything to do with water.\n\n[h1]I imagine you would like this game if:[/h1]\n-- You have always wanted to be a pirate.\n-- You have at least one person to adventure with some of the time.\n-- You like to blow things up.\n-- You like to sneak away from danger.\n-- When playing other games, you find yourself getting lost and spending hours NOT doing the mission objectives, but have a better time for it.\n\n\n[b]TL; DR:[/b] I highly recommend this game, for the buccaneer in all of us.", "timestamp_created": 1603139635, "timestamp_updated": 1603139775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 282, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932456612586975098", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70359157": {"recommendationid": "70359157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004082846", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1703, "last_played": 1592137780}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I was about to say that this game is totally undeserving the hype and is a bad game, but, it has these \"burps of greatness\" which changes everything. \n\nLet me explain, it is really atmospheric and open to imagination rather than grind. \n\nFirst night i was playing SoT, we were four friends and two were actual seamen. It was understandably epic to act like pirate crew while using all the lingo of actual sailors, trying to get into battle. However, it was the second night i played the game which actually hooked me.\n\nMe and two others had this mid-tier ship and i decided that we should be pirate hunters instead of pirates. Since everybody is complaining about PVP in forums and wanting PVE, i thought \"hey, i guess we can make friends\" and it would be great to experience the other side for a change.\n\nWe've traveled around for a while with random quests and found this riddle message in a bottle, eventually leading to this avian themed island with bird like statues. It took us so long to get the riddle right, one of our crew members passed out from drinking in real life, so we put his character in brig (holding cell in our ship). After we solved the riddle as the remaining crew members, we've decided to get the goodies to an island with merchants and on our way we had an encounter which went friendly after announcing ourselves as such. We were now sure that we can sail friendly and only engage if necessary or to hunt more notorious pirates. After all, notorious ones are easier to identify, heavily modified ships are more likely to be owned by experienced players, which in turn more likely to be hostile on spot due to being more confident with the game.\n\nCouple of minutes later we left the port again, we were chasing around another ship to ask whether they saw any pirates (hoping they would say; \"Yes, us!\" , so we could start a fight and end the night in high note with all the shenanigans) and found one lone ship anchored near a field of debris. Much to our disappointment, this group turned out to be friendly as well and pointed us further north for pirates. We, in disbelief and sure they were lying, sailed north anyways to maintain character but also keeping an eye out for this one ship on our back. Then suddenly, loud noise of cannonshots! Two ships, one manned by undead came out of nowhere and guns started blazing. The last thing i saw before leaving the ship with a keg of cannon-powder was Kraken's arms raising up. I lit the barrel, threw the keg at this huge tentacle and swam as fast as i can to get away, shouting \"help\" towards the crew we just had a chat. \n\nMy ship went down, but,i survived the ordeal with heavy injuries, yet the undead ship followed me to battle with these guys as well. I immediately jumped to this unknown ship's guns, shouting \"friendly! friendly!\" and started bombarding while good captain tried to rout away from both ships and a storm. I must add at this point that we were not sharing a common language. Either i landed enough shots on the other ships or captain was good with his trim but we got away. Sound of sea and the wind went back to normal, checking the ship i saw only the captain was alive, the other crew member i don't know what happened. \n\nAfter a minute of silently emoting respect, I saw something shining on the sea, a bit behind us, closer to the battle zone. You see, i had to check it. Shouting one last farewell, I jumped off the ship, ofcourse i was trusting the friendly mermaids for a ride back home. Among some barrels floating, i found this peculiar blue stone, most likely from another ship sunk by the undead crew or the second ship which attacked us at the start of the fight. I wanted to take the stone back home with me but the damned mermaid refused to take me back with the stone in my hand. So, I decided to make my way to the nearest island, swimming angrily to the stupid mermaids. \n\nEverything was well until i saw a fin on the surface of the water, got attacked by the shark almost immediately after i saw it. Raising my pistol, i spent my last shot on the predator and immediately started slicing it with my new sabre. To my suprise, it didn't take too long for this shark to be mortally wounded and somehow i survived yet again. I made my way to this rock formation which i initially thought was an island and climbed a bit to use my spyglass, there were no sign of life for miles. The damned mermaid below me, i was checking for other ships to get a ride, hopefully not giving up on this blue stone (Sapphire of the Mermaid or something). It was one really long day for Papenbard the Privateer.\n\nThat is where i left off, an amazing adventure for me. What is even better, when i get in the game next time, it will start in a tavern with a mysterious stranger commenting something like \"Aha, another new face. That was quite the celebration when you arrived... I am not surprised you don't remember it. \"\n\nIt is atmospheric.\n\n**Edited for typos & clarifications.", "timestamp_created": 1591402055, "timestamp_updated": 1593179704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 751, "votes_funny": 137, "weighted_vote_score": "0.931073129177093506", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120799563": {"recommendationid": "120799563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837442777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2435, "last_played": 1691691747}, "language": "english", "review": "my friend and i harpooned a megalodon and the entire ship flipped. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1660766182, "timestamp_updated": 1660766182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 234, "votes_funny": 167, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928712010383605957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104531642": {"recommendationid": "104531642", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972853390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 63630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49923, "last_played": 1691323430}, "language": "english", "review": "Sea of thieves was the game that finally brought old friends back together.

You're a pirate, you can see and guess what kind of asshattery people will present you with. \n\nThe game graphics wise is beautiful, a lot of people will say the sea mechanics is a part of what makes this game and it does! The hand to hand combat is simple, but very engaging. You'll see what I mean if you get this game. You have a sword and three gun types to choose from. \nCombat at sea is fun with a fair few types of cannonballs to be using, your inner pirate will awaken at some point, one day you will say enough is enough with the PvE and losing your loot to PvP'ers, you realise you can't ignore PvP forever. On the one hand, there are pirates out there that live for PvP and others that live for PvE. \n\nPvE and PvP; some servers are more PvP, some servers are more PvE. You gotta scope the server out like reading the room. You can alliance up with another crew, you get half value of what they turn in which boosts profit for everyone. However pirate asshattery is to be expected even in an alliance. \nAnd in what feels like more of a PvE server, you will still get PvP. So always, even if its chill be on your guard. \n\nThats basically it without going into the game in more detail. I won't go into the content of the game because you have to discover that stuff for yourself. Plenty of questing for treasure to be done thats for sure! And if you're more curious as to whats happening in the world around there is plenty of opportunity to explore and find out. \n\nI will say though if you're a new pirate its best to get on in with randoms if you've no one else to play with, you can have some bad experiences but there are plenty of people out there willing to show you the ropes. Its a case of being on the right boat :)\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1620737941, "timestamp_updated": 1620738006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 303, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.92310631275177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93531722": {"recommendationid": "93531722", "author": {"steamid": "76561199160796458", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5240, "last_played": 1639409480}, "language": "english", "review": "a pirate called me a homophobic slur and sunk my ship                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       10/10", "timestamp_created": 1623355829, "timestamp_updated": 1624025002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2619, "votes_funny": 1850, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920958578586578369", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78816602": {"recommendationid": "78816602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182368245", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 34315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17602, "last_played": 1662262534}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great game with a lot of good stuff to do, although I recommend having friends and not playing solo\n\nBut this comes with a warning as well. You will have hours of progress taken from you from other people. People will hunt you down and bully you for literally no reason. The community (mostly) isn't toxic, but it is highly encouraged to hunt other people instead of working on your own profit. Even making an alliance is flawed, as you only get half value on things other members sell. Speaking from experience, you simply have to put up with the fact someone can come along and ruin your day at any time. It's quite unfortunate, some of the best parts of this game are with other crews, but you have to treat others with so much caution that fun interactions are few and far between. If these things are a dealbreaker, then I don't even blame you, and I recommend you either find some friends (preferably skilled ones) or avoid solo at all costs.\n\nAlso, you can have public ships, but I wouldn't trust those with my life, outside of arena\n\nEdit: because people seem to be misunderstanding, I have no problem with people focusing more on the pvp than the pve, and targeting other players for profit. What I do have a problem with, however, if often people will just outright assault you, even if its clear you don't have any loot on you, and sink everyone they see for the sake of sinking people. it drives new players away, and just makes it even harder to get people to trust you. The fact that I have to warn new players that you can and will get bullied for literally no reason should be enough of a point, but the fact people still use the \"Its Sea of Thieves not Sea of Friends\" excuse for them not robbing, just murdering for no reason really drives home how some of the playerbase are, and how badly they want to feel in the right for attacking people for no reason.

I'd say that mindset is more than justified.\n\nI believe this game is a massive outlier when it comes to genuine ethical backtracking \nin terms of ongoing work retroactively fixing the game.\n\nOver the past 2 years SoT has recieved close to the most free updates and hard labor of love \nI've ever seen put into a game that never needed it to bring the money in.\nMany would say that sort of description already fits games like No Man's Sky, \nbut its approach to it and the design decisions are what makes Sea of Thieves stand out.\n\nUnlike NMS, progression in SoT isn't vertical, but horizontal. \nMeaning all of its mechanics can be experienced in the first hour of play \nand will not differ from someone like me, who has played it for over 1000 hours \non the M$ Store version. \n\nWhile this means overall incentive is that not unlike your high score in an arcade game,\nif you actually view the game as what is essentially an open world, \nper session arcade experience, the genius behind this design starts making sense.\n\nEvery single update the game has received doesn't suffer from the growing pains of any service game that relies on conventional progression systems.\nIf Rare decides to add a literal grappling hook mechanic to the game \nthat lets you hook onto rocks and pull off drift maneuvers, \nyou will get to experience that mechanic the moment you log in. \n\nThis is where that approach really shines.\n\nNew mechanics aren't just one and done features, every single one of these now gets to be designed to enrich the gameplay loop itself, meaning the developers have full freedom to find all kinds of secondary and primary uses for just a single mechanic.\n\nFor example: \n\nThe rowboat was advertised alongside the volcano region in the game, \nbut it's not just a tool to savely park your ship away from erupting volcanos.\n\n- Rowboats can be used as a stealth item that lets you hide your ship \nand silently sneak up to another crew to steal all their belongings. \n\n- If an island holds many treasures, a rowboat is usually the fastest way to gather it all up and bring it back to your ship if you're in a hurry, which you WILL be.\n\n- If your ship sinks, your rowboat remains and you get a second chance to secure your efforts.\n\n- Rowboats also include their own storage space and as of recently are a very reliable source of supplies if you find them on islands. Effectively cutting supply gathering time in half.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on how new features retroactively add to previous mechanics as well.\nFor example, the aforementioned harpoon can be found on certain rowboats as well which, \nif you have it docked on your ship, allows for an entirely new grappling angle.\n\nSo yes, Sea of Thieves is a service game. \nAs such it has benefited from new content stacked on top of the already existing structure.\nThankfully that structure is incredibly flat and wide, meaning climbing that structure \nto reach said features is non-existent.\n\nThis unfortunately means what was already there could hardly be fixed without entirely redesigning the whole structure which has NOT happened. It's still the same game but with most of its holes and gaps being closed up by genuinely great mechanics and content.\n\nYes, if you played Sea of Thieves on release \nand disliked the \"go from point A to point B, back to A then repeat\" experience,\nthat has largely been unchanged and the occasional dead air, while now being shorter than ever, will probably still bore you as much as before. \n\nHowever when that dead air is gone, you will experience many many more interesting and fun\nscenarios with an incredible amount of tools and ways in how you deal with those situations.\n\nThe point of this review isn't to just list all the positives and negatives, \nafter all you will find plenty of those already, but to explain why people who have stuck with the game all this time consider the new additions it has received to be much more valuable than they might look to someone who's never played it.\n\nSea of Thieves has proven to not only be one of the most unique \nand fun coop experiences I've ever played, it reminds me of a time \nwhen Rare took a formula, injected as much of their own personality and charm as they could\nand also manage to introduce an incredibly polished and innovative title \nthat stands on its own merit...

It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.", "timestamp_created": 1648178993, "timestamp_updated": 1648178993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1061, "votes_funny": 108, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915908634662628174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94336833": {"recommendationid": "94336833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067848231", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 5850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1435, "last_played": 1694900710}, "language": "english", "review": "This must be the best pirate game i've ever seen.", "timestamp_created": 1624628208, "timestamp_updated": 1624628208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 247, "votes_funny": 152, "weighted_vote_score": "0.915149152278900146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70465216": {"recommendationid": "70465216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084100370", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1680933751}, "language": "english", "review": "This nautical nonsense be something you wish", "timestamp_created": 1591574533, "timestamp_updated": 1591574533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 556, "votes_funny": 678, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913156032562255859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79346423": {"recommendationid": "79346423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356104949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1649732463}, "language": "english", "review": "I found a chicken\ncaged it\nnamed it Cernest\nwent on a mighty battle in the fire skeleton land with my pals and Cernest\nhe died in battle\nwe had a burial \n10/10 rip Cernest", "timestamp_created": 1605513260, "timestamp_updated": 1605513260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 564, "votes_funny": 294, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912265181541442871", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70398921": {"recommendationid": "70398921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157705232", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1686, "last_played": 1625719571}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very enjoyable.\n\nThough, for those that are solo players: be prepared for frustration and anger.\nAs a new player I've had nothing but bad experiences meeting other players. Though they're far and few in between, I'm constantly being shot to pieces.\n\nThe dynamic events will jump on you at the worst possible times. Surviving a Kraken straight out of a respawn is not possible.\n\nI don't have IRL friends to play with; and I think that's 90% of the experience in this game. I don't know how I feel about playing with strangers - but we'll see. I might try signing up for a crew soon enough - don't know yet.\n\nI've been shot in outposts/safezones, had my boat sat on fire and you name it - it's not a solo friendly game. Know that when you buy it. If you HATE PvP... well, take a guess.\n\nI've only played 28hrs as of this review and it's been solo.\nI hope you get to enjoy the game if you buy it!\n\n\nEdit on 07/06/2020\nTo clarify on Whiterabbit's comment:\n- I'm not saying people shouldn't shoot each other, but that I used the first hours of me playing this game *trying* to learn the mechanics and it was overwhelming. I've been attacked straight after spawning in on new ship, while docking for my first voyage, while in town. The pirate code is just that: A CODE! not a rule. And I think PvE minded players need to be aware of that. There's no safe place; you can be shot, killed, and sunk anywhere at any time - even as a new player who just opened the game. I've also tried turning my back on my ship to turn in my treasure for like 20seconds, I came back and a Galleon had docked and sat my sloop on fire; they apologized and repaired my sloop and when I was out on voyage again, I noticed they had ripped my sloop for every possible resources. \n\nAs an anchored sloop trying to do a voyage, meeting a PvP ready Galleon was by no means fun and they shot me only for the sake of shooting me. This type of encounters can be grueling and very demoralizing. New players need to be aware of this because it makes or breaks the game for some of them.\n\nNot everyone is okay playing with other people due to anxieties and playing solo is their only option - this game will not be for them. I'm simply trying to make a certain group of gamers aware that there's no Single Player version of this game and you won't be left alone out there on the seas.\n\nSolo and Single-Player is two very different things.\n\nIf I'm going to play with other people, I'll play with someone I know in real life.\nThe game does encourage team-work and I love that - even the alliance system is cool.\n\nAnd I know I'm making it sound like the game is such a bad thing, but I just have to highlight certain events that'll make some people really bumped out about having spent 40EUR.\n\nPersonally I love the game to bits. There's things and details that annoy the living out of me, but I understand why it's done as it is. The treasure system is fantastic, I LOVE the riddles and bounties, I love the different factions and that some items can be turned in to any of them for extra experience. The Sailing mechanics are very enjoyable once you get it down - and sailing a sloop alone is almost therapeutic.\n\nWhile the game is very linear and grindy, it's a joy.", "timestamp_created": 1591464456, "timestamp_updated": 1591529130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912248611450195313", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117923496": {"recommendationid": "117923496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292287462", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 16628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16116, "last_played": 1670129084}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, it changes people.\n\nSome time ago, I was a pirate, we were all pirates, absolute scallywags sailing the high seas, plundering to our hearts content.\nthat was until our verbal punching bag of a friend, decided that had enough of the pirate life, and discovered a dark secret.\n\nAt first He spent his free time fishing, harmless right? that's what we thought at least, every day he spent less time plundering and more time fishing, more hours wasted catching fish, it wasn't long before his life spiralled into a depressive cycle of staying up 18 hours a day just to catch virtual fish for three months.

I didn't have treasure, I had just started the game, I didn't know what I was doing, or how to do it. Yet these people chased me across the map, yet I had the wind in my sales, and was faster than them. \n\nSuddenly, the wind changed direction, I had lost the speed, there were ghost ships ahead of me, and I was still being chased; I tried to escape around a large rock, but was cut off by the galleon. They boarded my ship, two started attacking me, while the other two were lighting my ship on fire, and firing the cannons. I had no treasure, and I was alone, I didn't understand why they were after me.

However, I vowed to get my revenge, even if I must do it from the depths of Davy Jones Locker. I respawned with my ship, and immediately got to work, I hunted down loot with a stranger that joined me, and together we made some money. I bought an outfit, because I needed to look the part.\n\nI had seen the same Galleon hunting down one of the new Ashen Winds skeleton lords. Together with my shipmate, we sailed towards them, and found their ship undefended, as they were fighting. We waited for a while, out of sight, our ship hidden behind an outcropping of some rocks. We let the fight go on for a while, before we lit their Galleon on fire, and sunk it to the depths like they had done to me. Once they had all died from the Lord, and respawned wherever their ship was. We went in and finished off the lord, and took all the loot to the furthest outpost we could find on the map, to lower the risk of the Galleon finding us. \n\nWe got plenty of good loot, and made lots of money.

(They also eat bananas to regain HP, just like in real life), and FISHING! I guess..\n\nMy main point is, you have a lot to do in this game, such as the campaign a.k.a Tall Tales, sidequests, and you can do it at your own pace.

I can't say anything for the solo players but i assure you, grab a friend or two and you'll see what i mean. You fight with the terror of the seas, explore, loot, duel with other pirates, and the game makes all that experience immersive and feel great. Not a lot of game can pull this off.

It reminds me of my life growing up on sailboats on the ocean in Hawaii, minus the pirates, loot and krakens, lol .. \nIt is a stunningly beautiful game.. So much detail and the graphics are phenomenal.. The quests are fun and creative and there's so much to do.. Even just island hopping and looking for loot is a good time.. It's also been super awesome meeting fellow 'pirates' from around the world.. It's a very social game which is a lot of fun.. I thought after reaching Pirate Legend and topping out in rank that the game would get dull or boring but there's always new events and commendations to take part in.. This game is anything but boring.. There is always something to do and enjoy.. \n\nHowever, like most games there are some downsides.. This game can be difficult to play solo.. Mainly fighting off enemy ships, galleon skelly's, doing some events, even some quests like vault quests can be difficult on your own... \n\nAnother issue is the maps can be really hard to read and navigate in order to dig up treasure.. They don't have a lot of detail to them and some can take an hour or more to find..  A little more fine detail would be nice..\n\n Also, the sailing between islands is very time consuming at times.. Just sailing from one island in a quest to the next can take a pretty long time.. This isn't really a game you can plan to hop on for a half hour or so.. I have found it takes a good two hours to even complete a quest or event, so plan on spending some time in game when you hop on your ship..\n\n Another thing is there is no option for just PVE, which sucks when you would really just like to get on and play the game and not do PVP.. This is personally my biggest issue.. \nSure, people will say 'This is Sea of Thieves! Not Sea of Friends!' yada yada... Yes, we all know this.. But it would be nice to have the option to just do PVE or just play with friends.. I have noticed a progression in my 631 hours playing of players being downright nasty.. I strongly feel like some get on not to rank up, do quests or events, meet new people or enjoy the beautiful scenery in the game.. No, their number one focus is just to attack people.. Not to even take their loot or their emissary flag, but just to ruin someone else's game, and waste hours sometimes that it has taken to collect that loot and finish a quest..\n People can even form an alliance with you, do a fort or quest with you and then once you've spent hours working as a 'team' turn on you, kill you, blow up your ship, and steal all of the loot you all just worked hard to get.. I have quit doing alliances after having this happen at least a dozen times.. Basically, no one is your friend.. Unless they are in your crew you should not trust them..\n It can just be pretty frustrating to have some jerks come along and attack you, even when you have no emissary flag up, no loot and your're literally just cruising around exploring.. In recent weeks since the game has been on sale I have played with at least a half dozen or more brand new players who we've had this happen to and they've decided to no longer play, even uninstalling the game altogether because they're just frustrated with putting in all that time and work for nothing.. I get it.. \nThe latest one was an enemy attacking me saying 'Come on baby, come get me' and 'Come here sexy lady, take your shot' and just being really rude and obnoxious.. I try hard not to give a reaction since that's what they're wanting but it can be borderline bullying and Rare allows it.. So you really have to have thick skin sometimes with some of these nasty people..\n \n  Lately, more often then not, I get off the game not reflecting on what a good time it was or how much gold I made or quests I did, or cool people I've met, but annoyed and angry because of repeatedly being attacked to the point I couldn't even really even play the game..\n I'll never stop playing but my biggest wish for this game would be to give the option to just play PVE or with friends if you're not up to constant battling.. Believe me, with the right crew a good ol ship fight is a lot of fun.. Your adrenaline goes crazy and it can be awesome.. But sometimes you don't want to play that kind of game, you just want to play a chill game, and it be nice to have that choice... \nOverall, this game is my favorite game to play.. It is so much fun.. I recommend it to everyone I know.. And every new season has great new additions.. I hope this review can help someone considering the game or new to the game to know what to expect!

Its environment, immersive sailing and beautiful graphics made this game a pure joy to play, explore and experience. The campaign stories (called \"Tall Tales\") are intriguing, inventive and curious to play-through.\n\nWhen it comes to combat regarding the melee strikes with the sword or guns, it feels a bit lackluster and basic. Battling enemies head-on lacks challenge and is relatively simple. That said, the boat battles against Skeleton Ships, Ghost Ships, Kraken, Megalodon or other players is very satisfying and unique. The amount of ways to mess around with your opponent, blow their ship while also repairing and steering your own creates a frantic scene of cooperation among you and your crewmates each and every time. Moments where you T-Bone an enemy ship, grapple their hull and then proceed to invade their deck to release the anchor to prevent them from moving as your allies rain down a variety of cannonballs that inflict different effects and damage is exciting that I have yet to see matched in other games. To add, depending on the size of your crew from 2 players to 4, you will be provided larger ships from a single-said Sloop to a massive Galleon, all with their own benefits and short-comings, making battles incredibly challenging.\n\nAnother key part of the game is the progression in the game. For some players, the lack of progression detracts motivation to continue playing. However, if you are someone who enjoys the experience of games more so than rewards, this may be the game for you. In Sea of Thieves, what you start with is what everyone else has and there is no additional unlocks, access to better weaponry/ships or other in the game. The quests, currencies and rewards are all related to cosmetics to improve the look and feel of yourself and your ship.\n\nTo end, if GTA is the open-world grindfest to unlocking cooler cars, upgrades and real estate then Sea of Thieves is its counterpart where everything is already unlocked and you simply sail for the great times and moments with your shipmates.", "timestamp_created": 1592414406,

even more than when I started. Hope to see you on the seas some day!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW ~\n\nSea of Thieves is a satisfying adrenaline rush and surprisingly balanced if you enjoy PvP.\n\nI'm always on the lookout for new co-op games on Steam. When Sea of Thieves popped up, I mentioned it to a few friends and one of them was ecstatic. He insisted that I get it ASAP so we could play together. I'm so glad I did. Within the first 10 hours, this became one of my favorite co-op games.\n\nThings started out a bit rocky. My best friend and I simultaneously booted up the tutorial. After I beached and un-beached my ship, I shambled through the rest of the tutorial on my end, a little concerned about whether or not I'd ever handle the multitasking that's required to be an effective pirate in this game. Soon after, our good friend joined us and I went into full-on panic mode. There are other players? Right now?! All around us?!!?! I knew there was a PvP element, but I thought we were playing a private game and that we'd be able to do that in the future.\n\nIt wasn't long until we were raided by another ship, and it was definitely just for lulz. The three of us were at an outpost with zero loot. It wasn't long until it was over, however, and as we watched their ship sink and I came down from the stress, I grinned. [i]That felt amazing.[/i]\n\nI never envisioned getting so hyped about PvP. I avoid most PvP anymore because of cheating and toxic communities, but Sea of Thieves does it quite well and I've had, so far, a very fair experience. While I've lost some battles, I've never felt that something was unreasonable. I've had people cuss me out for swiping their loot, killing them, etc. If I could offer any advice to a new player, it's [b]learn to pay attention to your surroundings as much as possible.[/b]\n\nThis isn't a game where absolutely anyone can easily sneak up on you without you having ample time to do something about it, and this isn't a game where people are required to leave you alone. If you decide to stop at an outpost to sell your loot when you see a player ship in the distance, then you're setting yourself up as a target. If you truly feel a player is harassing you, scuttle your ship and spawn somewhere else. With almost 60 hours in this game now (now well over 100 as of June 30. 2020), though, I really have a hard time wrapping my head around just how people feel like they can't get away from other players. The only thing I can conclude is that they're just not paying enough attention to what's around them.\n\nI've played on all three ships now by myself and with a team of friends. If you're solo, the sloop is fast enough to outrun any ship against the wind. It's actually very easy to completely avoid other players on it if that's your jam. The brig and galleon add the thrill of teamwork and communication. As with any PvP game, Sea of Thieves is not without its toxic players. This is honestly why I primarily play solo or with friends because I just don't personally enjoy teaming up with random people. I've met cool people and salty jerks, and it's really nothing different from any other PvP experience in my opinion.\n\nThe rewards for completing anything in this game are purely cosmetic. While I was lukewarm about that at first, I appreciate how it levels out the playing field for players of any skill set. Even with micro-transactions, there's no pay-to-win mechanic.\n\nWhile players are certainly a threat, there are plenty of other things that can sink your ship, from The Kraken to a rainstorm, from ghost ships to a poorly placed gunpowder barrel. It's difficult to deal with some of the PvE threats when you're solo, but it's very possible with practice and patience!\n\nSea of Thieves is also graphically and musically beautiful. It easily has the nicest looking water I've [i]ever[/i] seen in a video game. I'm normally a little thalassophobic when it comes to large bodies of water in video games, but it's just so darn gorgeous that I'm always ready to jump in and swim around.

Thieves[/u] (SoT) is an open-world first-person action-adventure game where you can be a pirate as a pirate can be. It promotes PvP and PvE action side by side at the same time while Its main focus is directed towards utilizing team play and heavy cooperation.\n\n[h1][b]It's not about the gold, It's about the glory[/b][/h1]\n\ud83d\udd38There is no profound main story overshadowing the game but every island, character, treasure, and chest is dipped in a piece of lore, just to be expanded more and more with the upcoming DLCs. Meanwhile, You can set sail towards grand adventures to uncover various secrets and how this archipelago was cursed, by doing lengthy quests known as Tall Tales. If you want to pursue the somewhat convoluted story, take on them or perhaps you just want to be a damn pirate, go for it. The game gives you free rein to choose whether you want the lore or not and I think it is great in that manner.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2215673653\n\n[h1][b]An altogether different meaning of cooperation[/b][/h1]\n\ud83d\udd38You're given two modes to choose what type of adventure to start.\n[list]\n    [*]Adventure: The primary experience of SoT. This mode focuses on the PvPvE aspect and consists of all the voyages, events, and everything the game has to offer. Players can choose any of the vessel sizes to start their journey. Sloop (two-man), Brigantine (three-man), and Galleon (four-man).\n    [*]Arena: A full PvP mode that heavily revolves around naval battles in duo or quad-play. Players fight each other against the clock for points.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Loot and currencies[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38Treasures and gold can't be found so easily. Mostly you have to follow an X-mark map and solve several amusing and brain-tickling riddles or perhaps take on a more aggressive approach by looting an enemy ship. These quests can be either bought or found lying along the shorelines. The payment for quests and loots is deeply generous but there's nothing more than skins to buy. Soon you'll run out of things to buy in SoT. Currency in the game is divided into three items.\n[list]\n    [*][b]Gold[/b]: Most common currency obtained by selling loot. Used to purchase cosmetics, items, and quests.\n    [*][b]Doubloons[/b]: Awarded for completing commendations. They can be exchanged with Duke in taverns for special voyages and cosmetics.\n    [*][b]Ancient Coins[/b]: Obtained via real money to buy from the Emporium Shop (purely cosmetic). Also rarely dropped by ancient skeletons.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Trading companies[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38SoT is dominated by three main trading companies knowns as \"Gold Hoarders\", \"Merchant Alliance\", and \"Order of Souls\". They each only buy certain types of loot from you. Should you choose a riskier yet more profiting way to bootleg your belongings, the \"Reaper's Bones\" awaits you. Additionally another company, \"Athena's Fortune\", is accessible to only Pirate Legends (requires reaching level 50 in all three main companies).\n\n[b][u]You can do handbrake turns in a ship, who knew?[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38Sailing a ship has never been so realistic. You're given a compass and the rest of the knowledge comes with time. Sails must be angled properly to adjust the speed. Repairing the ship requires agility or hours of work might sink in the bottom of the seas. You must interact cooperatively with most of these elements to speed things up. Overall, it's not as complex as it sounds. The whole experience is easy to learn but hard to master.\n\n[b][u]No progression, whatsoever[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38The gameplay becomes monotonous since no ranking system or character progression is present. On one hand, it's a good starting point that all players are given the same gear and weapons and only skill would save them from death. On the other hand, it makes it difficult to spot decent pirates and have productive journeys with random people. \n\n[b][u]The heart of PvE[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38Is numerous world events that take you through epic naval battles or set you and your crew off to fight skeletons and solve riddles. Smaller events such as hunting Megalodons or the Kraken occurs randomly in the sea. While major ones like Ashen Lords or Ghost fleets will stay around until they're completed. The events are considered as a great challenge and are almost impossible to come through without seasoned crewmates.\n\n[b][u]Bosses are um... too tanky![/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38Most events end with a boss fight. These encounters could be often intense as each one has different stages and summons minions during the fight. However, they lose their variety soon because all bosses share the same set of attacks and moves. Their huge health pool is just a \"hit it until it's dead\" situation that bores you to death. Needless to say, the melee system feels lackluster and basic.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2215726217\n\n[b][u]Joining publics is unnerving[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38The fact that no lobby joining option is implemented in the game after 2 years of development is what bothers me the most. No info is given when joining a game such as latency, the ongoing quest, etc. You cannot cancel the joining process once you start searching for a crew.\n\n[b][u]Getting more technical[/u][/b]\n\ud83d\udd38Hud is minimalist with absolutely no intrusive elements cluttering the screen and your view for more immersion. SoT offers a considerable amount of \"Accessibility features\" to aid anyone with the slightest disability to enjoy the game. Features like Text-to-Speech, narrating UI elements, various colorblind filters, etc. that distinguish SoT from other titles.\n\n\ud83d\udd38[u][i]All contents could be exhausted within 200 hours if played efficiently but bear in mind due to RNG factors of quests and events, the replayability is immensely high[/i][/u]\ud83d\udd38\n\n\n[h1][b]Sun. Sands. Sea[/b][/h1]\n\ud83d\udd38At first glance, the cartoonish style might put you off but to be fair the visuals are extraordinary and breathtaking. The water effects and physics are phenomenally realistic. The days are brightened with cheerful colors. It's practically impossible not to take a minute to gaze upon the stunning sunrises/sunsets while sailing the seas. The nights are filled with stars and auroras that never lose their charm and are somewhat gloomy, in a good way.\n\n\ud83d\udd38During naval battles, the music intensifies the situation with epic pieces similar to the \"[u]Pirates of the Caribbean[/u]\". Also, you can set up the greatest radio station ever. Bring out your instruments, play shanties, and sing along with your crewmates.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2215681305\n\n\ud83d\udd38[b][u]TECHNICAL[/u][/b]\ud83d\udd38\nSpecs: GTX1050 2GB - Athlon II X4 645 - 8GB DDR3 RAM\nThe game runs with a mix of medium and high settings using about 80% of VRAM at 1680x1050 30 FPS\n\n\ud83d\udd38[b][u]BUGS & ISSUES[/u][/b]\ud83d\udd38\n[list]\n    [*]Rare bugs like objects clipping into each other, ships despawning, or sent off flying.\n    [*][strike]Poor integration to Steam. Friends have to be added and invited only through the Xbox app.[/strike] It is now possible to invite friends through Steam.\n    [*]The hit registration system is fudged and might not work as intended due to connection issues.\n    [*]Event goals and challenges are not directly accessible in the game. External web pages must be visited.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]Verdict[/b][/h1]\nYour experience in SoT is what you make of it. It'll steal as many hours of your day as you let it. Although, the whole game has some rough edges around it. There are no meaningful purchases to make with all the gold you earn. Lack of depth to the melee system and the repetitive nature of boss fights might be dull and discouraging at times. Nonetheless, SoT is extremely fun and fascinating. I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this
